# Clinical Realism: Authentic GP Consultations

GP consultations are rarely the neat, single-problem encounters depicted in medical dramas. Real patients juggle work pressures, financial stress, childcare, and multiple health issues—all competing for attention in a 15-minute appointment. These synthetic notes authentically reflect this messy reality, capturing not just medical facts but the human complexity that shapes every consultation.

## Example 1: Telegraphic Documentation - Time Pressure

**File:** `notes/48277006_0345_Impetigo.txt` (29 lines)

**Context:** Brief, abbreviation-heavy note for childcare worker with school sores—demonstrates how rushed clinicians compress documentation while managing occupational health requirements.

```
22/11/25

24F ECE

C/O "cold sores on leg + arm" x ~1–2/52, itchy not painful, thinks spreading, works in childcare lots of "school sores" around

Hx:
Onset vague, started R shin small red spot → blister → yellow/honey crust. Now 3x R shin + 1x L forearm. No pus per pt, just crust. No fevers/chills, feels a bit tired only. No known same rash at home. Using old unknown cream at home (?steroid/?abx, >1 yr).

PMHx: nil signif per pt.
Meds: nil reg.
All: NKDA.

O/E: afeb 36.8 HR 76 BP 112/70 RR 14 sats 99% RA well
Skin: R ant shin 3 lesions 0.5–1.5 cm erythematous base + honey-coloured crust, superficial, mildly excoriated, NT, no surrounding cellulitis, no abscess. L dorsal FA 1 similar ~1 cm. No bullae. No face/oral lesions. No LAD. Rest exam unremarkable.

Impression:
→ Non-bullous impetigo limited (4 lesions) likely staph/strep
Low ARF risk (adult, metro, background -ve)
No systemic features

Plan:
- Topical abx: Mupirocin 2% oint bd–tds to lesions x 5/7 (thin layer to crusted areas)
- Stop old unknown cream
- Basic hygiene/wound care discussed, keep lesions covered with non-stick dressing esp at work
- Work: exclude from childcare until ≥24 hrs after starting mupirocin + lesions can be covered. Med cert 2/7 given.

Safety net: expect improvement 48–72 hrs. RTC/ED if ↑redness/swelling/pain, fever, feels very unwell, rapid spread or new blisters → consider oral abx + swab C&S.

F/up PRN if not improving in 3–5/7 or recurrent.
```

**Key realistic features:**
- Line 3: `24F ECE` — extreme abbreviation ("early childhood educator"), no full sentences
- Line 5: `C/O` — telegraphic chief complaint format
- Line 8: `Using old unknown cream at home (?steroid/?abx, >1 yr)` — patient self-medicating with mystery medication
- Line 10: `PMHx: nil signif per pt` — abbreviated history
- Line 18: `→ Non-bullous impetigo` — arrow notation for impression
- Lines 26-27: Work exclusion requirements integrated into simple diagnosis—public health responsibility
- Entire note: Dense medical abbreviations, minimal prose, captures essential clinical information in 29 lines

**Commentary:** Even "simple" presentations involve occupational health compliance, public health exclusions, and safety netting—all compressed into 29 lines of dense telegraphic documentation.

## Example 2: Multiple Competing Demands

**File:** `notes/17059001_0012_Prepatellar_bursitis.txt` (60 lines)

**Context:** Tiler with knee pain, uncontrolled diabetes, and Centrelink forms—three problems in one brief visit.

```
22/11/25

57M tiler – review + forms

CC: R knee swelling "bloody knee keeps blowing up" + Centrelink/housing forms. DM overdue review.

HPI
R prepatellar swelling ~3–4/12, worse 4–6/52. On knees all day, knee pads intermittent ("forget them in the ute").
Pain 4–5/10 rest, 7/10 kneeling/deep flex. Worse end of workday. ↓ w/e.
No fevers/rigors, no systemic sx. No known skin break. Says a bit red last wk after big day.
OTC ibuprofen "now and then". Ice occasionally. Can do stairs but slow/painful on bad days. Worried re future work capacity.

DM2 – last review ~9/12 ago. Multiple DNAs.
On EMR: metformin XR 1g bd, gliclazide MR 60mg mane. Admits poor adherence, ran out "a few weeks ago". No home BGLs. Denies osmotic sx. Diet poor. Missed previous bloods.

SH (brief): casual tiler, variable income. Applying public housing.

O/E
BP 138/82 HR 82 afeb. BMI ~30.
R knee – localised prepatellar swelling, skin intact, -erythema, -warmth cf L. Mild tender over bursa only. No joint effusion. ROM: flex limited ~100° by discomfort, full ext. Lig stable, McMurray -. WB ok, mild antalgic on first steps. No peripheral oedema. Feet quick look: skin intact, mild callus, DP +.

Ix ordered today
- FBE, U&E, CRP, ESR (r/o septic/inflammatory bursitis esp DM)
- HbA1c, FLP, LFTs, urine ACR (DM review)

Dx
1) R prepatellar bursitis – chronic, non-septic, occupational (repetitive kneeling).
2) T2DM – likely poorly controlled, non-adherent, no recent monitoring.
3) Work/functional limitation – kneeling, squatting, stairs on flare days.

Plan
R knee
- Non-septic clinically → no aspiration today.
- Rest/↓kneeling as able, emphasised proper knee pads (suggest spare pair at job site).
- Ice post-work. Light compression sleeve if tolerated.
- Analgesia: paracetamol up to 1g qid prn.
- NSAID trial: ibuprofen 400mg tds with food up to 5–7/7 if no GI/renal issues.
- Discussed possible bursal aspiration + steroid inj if persists once infection excluded – pt prefers watch and wait.
- Red flag advice: RTC/ED if red, hot, rapid ↑ swelling, fever, unable WB.

DM
- Re-start meds:
  • Metformin XR 1g bd with food (PBS)
  • Gliclazide MR 60mg mane (PBS)
- Discussed adherence strategies (pillbox, link to meals).
- Pathology done on-site today to minimise DNA.
- Plan longer DM review 1/52 – feet, BP, renal, retinal check, consider GPMP/TCA, nurse support/SMS reminders.

Forms/admin
- Centrelink/housing forms completed today: documented dx chronic R prepatellar bursitis + T2DM.
- Noted: pain with kneeling/squatting/prolonged standing/stairs when flared. Still able to work but limited for heavy floor tiling, may need modified duties/rest breaks.
- Recommended housing with ↓stairs if possible. Not certifying permanent incapacity for all work.

Follow-up
- Review 1/52 long appt – bloods, DM mgmt, recheck knee.
- Earlier prn if knee acutely worse or systemic sx.

Billing: Level C, bulk billed.

[Added 16:30 by Dr K – pathology not back yet, f/up as planned]
```

**Key realistic features:**
- Line 5: `"bloody knee keeps blowing up"` — colloquial Australian language
- Line 13-14: `Multiple DNAs... Admits poor adherence, ran out "a few weeks ago"` — frank non-adherence documentation
- Line 16: `casual tiler, variable income. Applying public housing` — socioeconomic barriers shaping care
- Line 46: `Pathology done on-site today to minimise DNA` — GP adapting strategy to patient behavior patterns
- Lines 49-52: GP completing Centrelink/housing forms during clinical consultation—realistic administrative burden

**Commentary:** Three problems competing for attention in one appointment—clinical care, diabetes management, and government paperwork—requiring pragmatic compromises shaped by socioeconomic reality.

## Example 3: When Patient and Doctor Disagree

**File:** `notes/44465007_0024_Ankle_sprain.txt` (68 lines)

**Context:** Retail worker with ankle sprain wants MRI and "strong painkillers"—but evidence-based guidelines don't support either.

```
22/11/25  14:10

27F

CC: R ankle pain, ?repeat NSAIDs

HPC:
- Twisted R ankle stepping off kerb ~2/52 ago
- Seen A/H clinic same day, ?sprain. Given "the proper strong ibuprofen, 800s" + short Panadeine course
- Now "still crook by the end of the day, standing on tiles all shift", swelling PM, pain ↑ with prolonged WB, no limp AM, slows PM
- "Just need the strong ones again, my usual doc would just give it, no questions"
- "No time for physio, can't afford days off"
- Asking for MRI: "Why can't we just scan it and fix it faster?"

No locking/catching/giving way. No numb/tingle. No calf pain, SOB, fever, redness. No prev sig ankle inj.

PMHx: nil sig. NKDA.
Meds: OTC ibuprofen 200–400mg up to TDS (last dose this AM), PRN paracetamol.
SHx: Retail, on feet all day. Non-smoker.

O/E:
Obs: BP 112/70, HR 78, RR 14, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA.
R ankle:
- Mild lateral swelling, resolving bruising over/inf to lat malleolus
- TTP ATFL > CFL region
- NO bony TTP post edge/tip med/lat malleolus, base 5th MT, navicular
- ROM: inv ↓ due pain, PF/DF near full
- WB: able >4 steps unaided
- Anterior drawer −/≈L, talar tilt not clearly ↑
- NV intact, calf SNT, no cords

Ottawa ankle rules −ve. No DVT/infective features.

A:
1) R lat ankle sprain, likely grade I–II, 2/52 post injury, improving but sx with prolonged standing. ?occupational aggravation
2) Analgesia/NSAID request – already on OTC ibuprofen; no indication for ongoing high-dose NSAIDs/opioids
3) ?MRI – not indicated at this stage

P:
- Explained sprain natural hx (4–6/52), 2/52 sx = expected. Reassured no clinical # or gross instability
- POLICE discussed briefly; advised compression brace and elevation PM (pt nods, "I'll try when I'm not wrecked after work")

Meds:
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/day)
- START naproxen 500mg BD with food x 5 days only (PBS gen), then STOP → if ongoing pain, use low-dose OTC ibuprofen PRN only
- NO concurrent ibuprofen while on naproxen
- Counselled re GI/renal risk, red flags (abdo pain, melaena, indigestion) → cease & review

Imaging:
- X-ray/MRI not ordered – Ottawa −ve, improving fxn, no red flags
- Explained MRI reserved if sx persist >6/52 / concern high-grade lig inj / intra-artic pathology
- Pt not happy but accepts "better than nothing" plan

Rehab:
- Home ROM + basic strengthening/balance exs – handout given
- Offered physio for structured rehab given job demands → pt initially "no time/no money" but agrees if after-hours appt; REFERRAL physio done

Work:
- Suggested ↓ standing, short seated breaks, better footwear (supportive/cushioned vs "cheap sneakers from work")
- Offered med cert for light duties 1/52 – pt declined ("boss will just cut my shifts")

Safety net:
- RTC/ED if ↑ pain, unable WB, deformity, calf pain/swelling, SOB, fever, redness/warmth joint
- If still sig pain/swelling/instability 4–6/52 → review, consider imaging (US/MRI) ± ortho

F/U:
- Review 2–3/52 or earlier if deterioration

[No addendum]
```

**Key realistic features:**
- Line 11: `"Just need the strong ones again, my usual doc would just give it, no questions"` — patient comparing doctors, wanting previous treatment repeated
- Line 13: `"Why can't we just scan it and fix it faster?"` — common misunderstanding that scans "fix" problems
- Line 12: `"No time for physio, can't afford days off"` — work and money barriers to recommended treatment
- Line 52: `Pt not happy but accepts "better than nothing" plan` — honest documentation that patient left dissatisfied
- Line 60: Declines medical certificate — `"boss will just cut my shifts"` — job insecurity preventing proper recovery

**Commentary:** Patient requests MRI and opioids; evidence doesn't support either. Doctor explains alternatives; patient accepts but leaves dissatisfied. This is routine general practice.

## Example 4: 9-Minute Consult - Telehealth + Occupational Barriers

**File:** `notes/6020002_0019_Tinea_pedis.txt` (40 lines)

**Context:** FIFO miner with recurrent tinea pedis, 9-minute bulk-billed telehealth video consult (timestamps documented: 15:10-15:19)—shows time pressure, work environment perpetuating disease, and telehealth examination limitations.

```
22/11/25 15:10  TH video f/up  (bulk billed MBS 91801)

34M miner WA FIFO – known tinea feet. "Prob nothing but want it checked"

Hx:
– Interdigital maceration 4th–5th toes bilat R>L. Itch ↓ but still there. Mild burning end of shift in boots
– Terbinafine 1% cream using ~od x ~2/52, often forgets bd, esp night shifts
– Heavy steel caps 12–14h/d, very sweaty feet. Synthetic socks from work
– No spread up foot, no nail ∆ per pt, no breaks/ulcer, no discharge, no malodour
– No fevers/rigors, no red tracking, no calf pain
– Mild groin itch "nowhere near as bad as toes" using same cream prn
– PMHx: recurrent tinea pedis/cruris, plantar hyperhidrosis, mild atopic derm (quiet). No DM known

O/E (video – limited):
Looks well NAD.
Feet: 4th–5th web spaces bilat white macerated skin + mild scaling, slight erythema edges, no obvious fissures, no weep/pus. Nails on view ok

Dx:
1) Tinea pedis – interdigital, partial response, ongoing RFs
2) Tinea cruris – mild
3) Plantar hyperhidrosis contrib
4) Atopic derm stable

Ix:
– No mycology prev. If persists → in-person + scrapings (S&N / QML) + consider LFTs pre oral terbinafine

Plan:
– Optimise topical: terbinafine 1% cream bd to toe webs + 1–2 cm margin x min 14/7 then od x 1/52 after clear
– Groin: terbinafine 1% od x 2–4/52
– Gen measures briefly discussed: keep feet dry, change socks, thongs in shared showers etc
– Consider antiperspirant spray to soles/toe webs for hyperhidrosis. If still bad → separate appt re stronger options

Red flags explained: ↑redness/swelling/pain, pus/foul smell, streaking up leg, fevers → urgent face-to-face (GP/ED)

F/up:
TH review 3–4/52 around off-swing. If no better → in-person review + mycology ± oral AF + LFTs

Pt: "I'll be more consistent with the cream and socks" – agrees

15:19 finished note
```

**Key realistic features:**
- Line 1: `15:10 TH video f/up (bulk billed MBS 91801)` — opening timestamp, billing code
- Line 40: `15:19 finished note` — **9-minute consult** (time pressure quantified)
- Line 3: `"Prob nothing but want it checked"` — patient minimizing, downplaying concern
- Line 7: `often forgets bd, esp night shifts` — shift work affecting medication adherence
- Line 8: `Heavy steel caps 12–14h/d, very sweaty feet. Synthetic socks from work` — occupational environment perpetuating disease
- Line 14: `O/E (video – limited)` — telehealth examination constraints explicitly documented
- Line 36: Must coordinate follow-up `around off-swing` — FIFO work schedule limiting access
- Shows bulk-billing economic constraints, geographic isolation (WA FIFO), work environment causing recurrence

**Commentary:** Work environment causes the problem, shift work impairs treatment adherence, FIFO roster limits follow-up, telehealth constrains examination—all managed in 9 minutes via video.

## Example 5: "Rushed" Consult - Complex Patient, Inadequate Time

**File:** `notes/4740000_0174_Herpes_zoster.txt` (38 lines)

**Context:** HIV-positive man with resolved shingles requesting unnecessary prophylactic medication—clinician explicitly documents being "rushed" while managing immunocompromised patient requiring longer appointment for comprehensive care.

```
22/11/25

42M HIV+ on ART (Royal [city] Hosp)

Reason: wants repeat valaciclovir "just in case"

Hx: shingles L thoracic ~3/52 ago
→ seen here then, valaciclovir 1g tds 7/7 completed
Rash now healed ~5/7, only mild intermittent tingling / brief stabbing pains
No new vesicles, no spread, no fever, sleep/work ok, no reg analgesia
No eye/face/ear involvement, no neuro red flags by hx

Meds:
- TAF/FTC + DTG daily (pt says fully adherent)
- PRN paracetamol
- Valaciclovir course finished

Allergies: NKDA

O/E (brief): looks well, rushed
BP 124/78 HR 76 afeb SpO₂ 99% RA
Skin L mid-thoracic: healed hyperpigmented patch only, no active vesicles, no erythema/warmth, not tender
Neuro grossly NAD

A:
1) Herpes zoster L thoracic – resolved, mild residual neuropathic sx only, no e/o PHN yet
2) HIV infection – stable by hx, immunocompromised, f/up tertiary clinic

P:
- No repeat valaciclovir – no active infection, no indication for suppressive Rx
- Analgesia PRN only (paracetamol up to 4g/day discussed)
- If pain persists/worsens esp >3/12 → consider PHN Rx (lidocaine patch / gabapentin)
- Asked to bring last HIV clinic letter/viral load/CD4 next visit
- Needs longer appt (20–30min) in next 1–2/12 for HIV + vax review (incl zoster vax timing), gen prev care & bloods
- No tests today – clinically well, zoster healed
- Red flags explained: facial/eye rash, fever, severe pain, neuro sx → urgent review/ED
- RTC earlier if any new rash or systemic sx

No scripts given today – rationale discussed, pt initially unhappy but accepts plan.
```

**Key realistic features:**
- Line 20: `O/E (brief): looks well, rushed` — **clinician explicitly documents being rushed**
- Line 5: `wants repeat valaciclovir "just in case"` — patient requesting unnecessary prophylaxis
- Line 34: `Needs longer appt (20–30min) in next 1–2/12` — complex patient requires time unavailable today
- Line 33: `Asked to bring last HIV clinic letter/viral load/CD4` — fragmented care across settings (GP vs tertiary HIV clinic)
- Line 39: `pt initially unhappy but accepts plan` — patient left dissatisfied after request declined
- Shows mismatch between patient complexity (HIV+, preventive care needs, immunization considerations) and available appointment time

**Commentary:** Immunocompromised patient needs comprehensive care, but rushed appointment only addresses immediate request—denying unnecessary prophylaxis while booking longer appointment for HIV review and vaccinations.

## Why This Matters

Sanitized medical datasets miss the human reality of healthcare. These notes capture what's actually documented in general practice:

**Colloquial language** ("bloody knee," "prob nothing," "just in case") · **Time pressure** (9-minute consults, clinician "rushed") · **Work and money shaping care** (FIFO rosters, shift work, "boss will cut my shifts," bulk billing) · **Patient-doctor conflict** (disagreements, dissatisfaction, moving forward anyway) · **Non-adherence** (DNAs, ran out of meds, "forgets esp night shifts") · **Occupational health** (work exclusions, work causing disease) · **Telehealth constraints** (limited exams, "no SpO2 available") · **Fragmented care** (missing letters between settings) · **Administrative burden** (Centrelink forms during consults)

Medical AI trained on textbook-style notes won't understand real healthcare delivery. These notes reflect the chaos, compromise, and messiness of actual general practice.
