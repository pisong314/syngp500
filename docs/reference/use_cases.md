# Use Cases

## Primary Use Case: Machine Learning and NLP Research

The primary intended use for SynGP500 is machine learning and natural language processing research in clinical text:

- **Clinical named entity recognition (NER):** Extract medical concepts, medications, symptoms, diagnoses
- **Information extraction and structuring:** Convert unstructured clinical notes into structured data
- **Clinical text classification:** Categorize notes by condition, urgency, complexity
- **Documentation quality analysis:** Analyze completeness, consistency, adherence to guidelines
- **Medical language model training and evaluation:** Train and benchmark clinical NLP models
- **Stylometric analysis of clinical writing:** Study variation in documentation patterns

## Secondary Use Case: Medical Education (with precautions)

These notes can be valuable for medical education, but require careful review:

- **Examples of GP documentation formats:** Show different styles and structures
- **Teaching clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis:** Illustrate diagnostic thought processes
- **Demonstrating consultation structure and time management:** Show how GPs balance multiple competing demands

**⚠️ IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS:**
- **Individual case review required:** Educators MUST review each case before using with students
- **Verify clinical accuracy:** Check management plans against current guidelines
- **Annotate or correct errors:** Do not assume clinical correctness without expert review
- **Not a substitute for expert teaching:** Use as supplementary examples, not primary teaching material

## Additional Applications

- **Clinical documentation training:** Help medical students and registrars learn note-writing skills
- **Health informatics education:** Demonstrate real-world clinical data challenges
- **Development of clinical decision support tools:** Create research prototypes (not for clinical use)
- **Quality improvement research:** Analyze patterns in documentation practices
- **Natural language generation evaluation:** Benchmark synthetic note generation systems

## Not Suitable For

This dataset should **NOT** be used for:
- ❌ Clinical decision-making for real patients
- ❌ Training clinical decision support systems for production use
- ❌ Diagnosing or treating actual medical conditions
- ❌ Assuming all clinical content is factually correct
- ❌ Healthcare quality audits (synthetic data, not real practice patterns)
