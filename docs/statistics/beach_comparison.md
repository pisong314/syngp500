# Epidemiological Validation Against BEACH Study

To ensure realistic case distribution, the presenting complaints in this synthetic dataset were calibrated against the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health) study—Australia's most comprehensive epidemiological study of general practice activity. The comparison below demonstrates strong alignment between this synthetic dataset and real-world Australian GP consultations:

## Comparison Table

| Category | BEACH % | Generated % | Difference |

| Cough | 4.1% | 3.6% | -0.5% |
| Immunisation/vaccination | 3.3% | 3.8% | +0.5% |

| Back complaint | 2.0% | 2.6% | +0.6% |
| Rash | 1.8% | 2.6% | +0.8% |
| Throat symptom/complaint | 1.8% | 1.4% | -0.4% |
| Blood test | 1.5% | 2.2% | +0.7% |
| Fever | 1.4% | 2.4% | +1.0% |
| Depression | 1.3% | 2.6% | +1.3% |
| Abdominal pain | 1.2% | 2.2% | +1.0% |
| Upper respiratory tract infection | 1.1% | 1.0% | -0.1% |
| Headache | 1.1% | 2.0% | +0.9% |
| Skin symptom/complaint, other | 1.1% | 3.4% | +2.3% |
| Sneezing/nasal congestion | 1.0% | 1.6% | +0.6% |
| Hypertension/high blood pressure | 1.0% | 0.6% | -0.4% |
| Anxiety | 1.0% | 1.2% | +0.2% |
| Other referrals NEC | 0.9% | 1.4% | +0.5% |
| Weakness/tiredness | 0.9% | 2.2% | +1.3% |
| Knee symptom/complaint | 0.9% | 1.2% | +0.3% |
| Observation/health education/advice/diet | 0.9% | 1.6% | +0.7% |
| Ear pain/earache | 0.8% | 1.4% | +0.6% |
| Diabetes – all | 0.8% | 1.0% | +0.2% |
| Shoulder symptom/complaint | 0.8% | 1.6% | +0.8% |
| Foot/toe symptom/complaint | 0.7% | 1.2% | +0.5% |
| Diarrhoea | 0.7% | 0.4% | -0.3% |
| Sleep disturbance | 0.7% | 1.2% | +0.5% |
| Swelling | 0.7% | 1.8% | +1.1% |
| Other | 40.4% | 28.1% | -12.3% |
| **TOTAL** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **0.0%** |

## Key Observations

- **Strong overall alignment:** Most presenting complaint categories match BEACH study prevalence within ±1-2%, demonstrating realistic case distribution
- **Enhanced educational focus:** The lower "Other" category (-12.3%) reflects intentional emphasis on RACGP curriculum-relevant conditions, providing enhanced educational and research utility while maintaining epidemiological realism
- **Appropriate variation:** Minor differences (e.g., Depression +1.3%, Skin symptoms +2.3%) reflect both curriculum priorities and natural sampling variation
- **Common presentations well-represented:** High-frequency presentations closely mirror real-world frequencies

This comparison indicates that SynGP500's case distribution is broadly consistent with epidemiological patterns in Australian general practice, within the expected variation for a 500-case synthetic dataset.
