6–8/52 ↑low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, poor conc, crying “most days”  
Intrusive ego-dystonic images harming baby (stairs, smothering) very distressed by this “I’d never do it but the pictures keep popping in” avoids being alone w baby

No psychotic Sx, no bizarre beliefs re baby  

PMHx: GAD + panic since teens  
Prev sertraline 50mg mane ~18/12 ago good effect but poor adherence → self-ceased when pregnant  
Old diazepam 2mg PRN panic >1 yr ago, none now

Meds: nil regular, occas paracetamol  
Caffeine ~5–6 cups instant coffee/day  

Risk:  
SI passive only, no plan, no access to unusual means  
Infanticidal thoughts intrusive only, ego-dystonic, no plan/intent, scared of thoughts not baby  
Good insight, strong attachment to baby, supports (partner, mum), self-presented  
Overall low–mod risk today, suitable community f/up

Ix:  
Plan baseline FBC U&E LFT TSH B12/folate (form given)  

Dx:  
1. Postnatal depression mod–severe with intrusive harm thoughts (ego-dystonic) no psychosis  
2. GAD + panic d/o exacerbated perinatal  
3. Sleep disturbance + high caffeine contributing  
4. Hx poor adherence meds/referrals  

Plan:  
Safety: discussed at length  
– Pt agrees if thoughts feel “out of control” will not stay alone w baby → call partner/mum to take over  
– Given ED / MH triage / Lifeline / PANDA nos  
– Advised urgent review/ED if ↑SI or any intent/plan re self or baby or psychotic Sx  

Meds:  
– Start sertraline 25mg mane 7/7 → ↑50mg mane if tol (prev effective) PBS  
   Rationale: mod–severe PND + GAD, breastfeeding compatible, risks of non-tx > med risk  
– Discussed SEs (GI, headache, initial ↑anxiety), onset 2–4/52, need to continue 6–12/12 once better  
– No benzos (BF + dependence)  
– Adv ↓ caffeine to ≤2 cups/day  

Adherence strategies: link dose to morning feed, phone alarms, ask mum to remind  

Psych:  
– Needs MH Treatment Plan + CBT/IPT perinatal  
– Time short today → booked longer appt next wk to do MHTP + make referrals while here (pt admits “I never get around to calling”)  
– Consider telehealth perinatal services (eg Gidget, PANDA) next visit  

Mother–infant:  
– Reassured intrusive thoughts are part of anxiety/depression not intent to harm  
– Will explore parent–infant / early childhood service referral at f/up  

F/up:  
– Review 5–7/7 booked before leaving  
   • Reassess mood, SI, harm thoughts, panic  
   • Check sertraline tol/adherence  
   • Repeat EPDS in 2–4/52  
   • Do MHTP + referrals  
   • Review bloods if done  
RTC earlier / ED if deterioration as above  

Pt tearful but relieved, says “I don’t want to be like this anymore I’ll try the meds this time” acknowledges hx missing appts – reception to send SMS reminder.
