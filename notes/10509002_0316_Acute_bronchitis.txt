- Intermittent nocturnal wheeze, mild DOE uphill  
- No pleuritic pain, no haemoptysis, no wt loss, no rigors, no documented fever  
- Concerned re ?pneumonia / ?lung Ca, requesting CXR/bloods  
- Thinks bleach / dusty air-con may have triggered  

Vax  
- Wants “school shots” – asks re dTpa, flu, “pneumonia one”, COVID  
- No records. dTpa >10 yrs by recall, missed this yr’s flu, last COVID ~2 yrs (?)  

PMHx: nil asthma/COPD/cardiac. No reg meds. NKDA. No recent travel, no known COVID/pertussis contacts.

Impression  
1) Acute bronchitis post-URTI (?viral LRTI) – no clinical features of PNA/HF/pertussis  
2) Health anxiety – reassurance seeking, heavy “Dr Google” use  
3) Vax status unclear – non-urgent, defer until current resp illness settled  
?CXR if sx >3/52 or red flags  

Ix  
- No bloods/CXR today – low yield, obs/exam reassuring. Explained.  
- No RAT/PCR – >5/7 sx, mild, no high-risk contacts  

Plan 09:12  
Acute bronchitis  
- Dx + natural hx explained (cough up to 3/52, sometimes 8/52)  
- No ABx / steroids / SABA / OTC combo meds – not indicated uncomplicated acute bronchitis  
- Analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol 500–1000 mg PO q4–6h PRN (max 4 g/24h)  
  - Ibuprofen 200–400 mg PO TDS PRN with food if needed, short term  
- General: fluids, avoid irritant cleaning products/smoke, ok to use steam with care  
- Safety-net: ED/urgent review if ↑SOB at rest, pleuritic CP, fever >38° >48h, rigors, confusion, haemoptysis, or generally much worse. RTC if no improvement 7–10/7 or cough >3/52 → consider CXR / chronic cough w/u  

Vax  
- Defer non-urgent vax until cough settled (~1–2/52)  
- Plan next visit:  
  - Flu vax (missed this season)  
  - dTpa booster (likely >10 yrs)  
  - Check COVID booster need per ATAGI once AIR/MyGov record available  
  - Pneumococcal not indicated at 34F otherwise well – discussed briefly  
- Asked to bring AIR printout/MyGov record next appt  
- Book nurse/GP vax appt 1–2/52 once improved  

Health anxiety  
- Validated concern, advised reducing online searching  
- Structured reassurance given re low risk Ca/PNA today, clear follow-up plan  
- Offered longer appt later if ongoing health worry → consider CBT/psychology referral; pt prefers to “see how cough goes first”  

F/U  
- RN/GP review 1–2/52: cough reassess + vax update  
- Earlier review if red flags / deterioration  

Time: 15 min std consult (acute bronchitis + vax discussion; MH/vax planning deferred to longer review).
