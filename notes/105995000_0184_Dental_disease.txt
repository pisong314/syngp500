Telehealth exam (limited)  
Speaking full sentences, no audible SOB, cough or wheeze. No red flag dental features by hx  

A/P  
1) Vaccination review / work clearance  
- Incomplete adult schedule for age + CVD  
- Due:  
  → Flu vax current season  
  → COVID booster (≥50 + CVD, none >12/12)  
  → dTpa booster (last 2014)  
- No C/I on hx  
Plan:  
- Explained needs in-person, can’t do via phone  
- Nurse appt within 1–2/52 for flu + COVID booster (if still due on day) + dTpa. Quick BP check if time  
- Reception to SMS/email appt details for employer  
- Consider pneumococcal + Shingrix at future review (see below)  

2) Chronic dental disease – intermittent R lower molar pain, no red flags today  
- Likely caries/periodontal dz, long-standing, ↑risk: diet, hygiene, smoking, poor f/up  
Plan:  
- Analgesia only short term: paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24h). Cautioned re NSAIDs given CVD – avoid excess OTC  
- Needs dentist – advised non-urgent but early review next few weeks (public/low-cost options discussed briefly)  
- RTC/ED/urgent dental if ↑pain, facial/neck swelling, fever, dysphagia, dyspnoea, trismus, spreading erythema, “feels really crook”  

3) CVD (IHD/HTN/HLD) – stable by report, meds adherence ?  
- No CP/SOB currently  
- Needs proper CVD review (BP, lipids, meds rec, bloods). Last labs ?overdue (no recent results in EMR – Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024)  
Plan:  
- Book long F2F 4–6/52 (pt to align with roster) for:  
  → BP, lipids, U&E, FBP, HbA1c, LFTs (if not done in last 12/12)  
  → Meds reconciliation + adherence  
  → Discuss pneumococcal + Shingrix at same time  

4) Depression/anxiety – chronic, current control ?  
- Pt vague re sertraline use + mood  
Plan:  
- Same long F2F 4–6/52 for MH review, med check, screen severity  

F/up  
- Nurse vax appt 1–2/52 (flu + COVID booster if due + dTpa, BP if possible)  
- Long GP F2F 4–6/52 for CVD + MH review, labs, further adult vax  
- Earlier review/ED if dental or cardiac red flags as above
