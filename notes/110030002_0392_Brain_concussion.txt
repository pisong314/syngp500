Mx / Plan  
Concussion  
– Explained CTB N concussion = functional brain inj not seen on CT usual recovery 1–2/52 ± longer mild sx  
– Red flags discussed HI: ↑HA severe repeated V drowsy/confus behav change seizure focal neuro sx visual change new neck pain etc → ED  

Activity  
– Adv 24–48h more relative rest avoid heavy exertion ladders roofs heights contact sport  
– Gradual ↑ light phys/cog activity as tol short walks brief screens breaks if sx↑ step back 24h then retry  

Work  
– OK trial light duties only if avail from early next wk if sx remain mild/stable  
   no ladders no heights avoid heavy machinery high risk tasks  
– Full RTW once sx-free @rest + w light activity ≥24h  
– Offered med cert for mod duties pt to discuss w supervisor can supply  

Driving  
– Advised nil driving total at least 1/52 post concussion + until signif sx resolved  
– Given persisting mild ↓conc + fatigue → avoid driving further 2–3/7 then short local trips only if sx-free while driving  
– Full driving when no sx recur  

HA  
– Paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
– NSAID only PRN occas w food if needed no regular  
– Reassured coffee 1–2/d OK avoid big caffeine swings maintain hydration  
– Sleep hygiene briefly re regular hrs ↓screens in bed limit EtOH
