Plan  

# Anxiety  
- Discussed likely link anx ↔ nicotine withdrawal + work stress + caffeine  
- Pt prefers non pharm for now feels sx not severe enough for meds  
- Brief psychoed re breathing sleep routine ↓ caffeine from 4-5 coffees/d → aim 2-3  
- Given info links for online CBT prog (This Way Up MindSpot etc)  
- Safety net generic  
  Pt advised to return if fever >38.5°C severe SOB chest pain or confusion or if mood worsens panic attacks or SI  

# Tobacco use disorder  
- Counselled re health risks role of nicotine in anx NRT/varenicline > willpower alone  
- Options discussed  
  • combo NRT patch + oral first line  
  • varenicline monotherapy alt (SE incl vivid dreams nausea ?mood)  
  • bupropion if others unsuitable  
- Pt choice today combo NRT start cut-down approach rather than firm quit date will reconsider varenicline if poor response  

Meds started today  
- Nicotine transdermal patch 21mg/24h 1 daily min 12/52 PBS  
- Nicotine gum 2mg PRN cravings up to ~10-15/day instructed park and chew  
- Advised may need ↑ patch dose or 2 patches if cravings not controlled will r/v 2-4/52  
- SE discussed incl skin irritation vivid dreams can remove patch nocte or use 16h patch if needed  

Behavioural  
- Brief ask advise help done  
- Goals  
  • This week no smoking in car  
  • Delay 1st cig by ≥15min using gum instead  
  • Track cig/day on phone or notebook  
- Quitline offered pt agreeable e-referral sent (HealthLink)  

Investigations  
Time limited today  
Ordered fasting bloods QML path within 1-2/52 for CV risk  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BGL and HbA1c  
- U&E LFT FBC  
Results pending r/v next appt  
Note: if significant smoking reduction later some meds may need dose review e.g. ADs warfarin benzos though nil currently  

Deferred topics  
- Full CV risk discussion BP plan to be done after bloods longer appt  
- Spirometry / lung function for COPD screen to consider next r/v as asymptomatic  

Follow up  
- R/V 2-3/52 for  
  • NRT response SE cig count  
  • reassess anx sx consider CBT referral ± meds if worsens  
- Earlier F/U if marked mood change SI severe insomnia agitation on NRT chest pain SOB or other acute concerns  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to summarise plan "start patches and gum push back first smoke cut down get bloods done come back in a couple of weeks"  
Appears pragmatic engaged motivated but realistic about difficulty of quitting
