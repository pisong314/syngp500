New pt, bulk bill walk-in  

27yo male (apprentice chippy), here with adult daughter translating – limited English.  

C/O “same tablets as before for leg pressure pain”. L lower leg. Known chronic exertional compartment syndrome per pt/daughter – dx ~6 months ago at sports clinic (no letters in Best Practice, nothing in My Health Record).  

Pain hx (bit all over the place, from both):  
- L shin/calf “tight, like going to explode” after ~20–30 mins fast walking / heavy work / stairs, settles ~15 mins with rest, elevating leg  
- No pain at rest currently, just “a bit tight after busy week”  
- Denies numbness/weakness/colour change, no fevers/trauma/redness/wounds  
- Has already stopped running as advised previously  

No PMHx of note otherwise. No prev surgery. NKDA (checked with both, some language barrier but both clearly deny any problems with meds).  

Social: apprentice carpenter, on feet all day, worried about time off work.  

O/E (brief):  
BP 118/72, HR 76, RR 14, afeb, SpO2 99% RA  
Looks well, walking ok in room.  
L lower leg: no obvious swelling/erythema/deformity at rest. Compartments soft today, mild tenderness over ant tibial area only. Full ankle/toe ROM, power 5/5, sensation intact, DP/PT pulses palpable, CRT <2s. No features of acute compartment syndrome currently. Neuro grossly non-focal.  

Impression:  
1) Chronic exertional compartment syndrome L lower leg – currently quiescent, typical exertional pattern, no red flags, no acute CS.  
2) Request repeat analgesia.  
3) Language barrier – relying on family interpreter, ↑risk misunderstanding.  

Plan (a bit rushed, time limited):  
- Explained (via daughter) that mainstay is modifying activity, meds only for short-term symptom relief. Avoid pushing through severe pain, rest when it starts.  
- Simple red flag advice given re sudden severe constant pain, numbness/weakness, colour change, inability to move toes – ED if that occurs.  

Analgesia:  
- Paracetamol first line:  
  • Rx: Paracetamol 500 mg tabs – take 2 tabs (1 g) up to QID PRN pain, max 8/day. Qty 100, 1 repeat.  
- NSAID as second line / short bursts:  
  • Rx: Ibuprofen 400 mg tabs – 1 tab TDS PRN with food, max 1200 mg/day. Qty 30, no repeat.  
- Briefly discussed NSAID cautions (GI/renal, avoid if unwell/dehydrated). Pt repeats “with food”.  

Referrals / further mgmt:  
- Suggested review with sports physician / orthopaedics to confirm dx (compartment pressure testing) and consider fasciotomy if work significantly limited.  
- Pt hesitant re cost/time off.  
- Printed referral today to public hospital ortho outpatients (paper – to be scanned in later, printer jammed initially). Warned re wait times.  
- Mentioned footwear may contribute – suggested not too tight steel caps, maybe cushioned insoles; can consider physio/podiatry later if ongoing problems.  

Safety net:  
- Asked daughter to repeat plan back – “Panadol first, Nurofen sometimes, stop work when pain bad, hospital if very bad pain or numb.” Adequate.  
- Simple written instructions in English given for her to translate at home.  

Other:  
- Pt briefly mentioned “sometimes back pain from lifting” but no time to go into this properly today – advised separate appt for back review.  

F/U:  
- Review with GP 2–3 weeks or earlier if ↑frequency/severity, pain not settling with rest, any weakness/numbness/colour change.  
- Asked to bring any old specialist letters/tests next visit.
