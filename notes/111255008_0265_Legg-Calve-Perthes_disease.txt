32 yr old male carpenter well known here  

CC  
Pt calling re recent work medical picked up limited R hip abduction and he’s been getting on/off R hip stiffness  

HPC  
Hx childhood Perthes R hip per pt “ball of the hip bone dying off” treated at kids hospital in Sydney no surgery discharged teens  
Last 1–2 yrs notices R hip stiff esp getting in/out of ute squatting kneeling at work um deep groin ache some days after long shift settles with rest and Nurofen 400mg PRN about once a week no acute pain today no night pain no fevers no trauma no locking or true giving way says sometimes leans more on L when it flares  
Thinks maybe new firmer mattress jamming hip up a bit queried if “Perthes is coming back” explained more likely degenerative change from old Perthes not recurrence  

No current meds regular no known drug allergies  
Still working full time heavy manual work avoids running does a bit of cycling gym  

Last face to face here ~10/12 ago note then of mild ↓ R hip abduction and IR otherwise NAD  

Exam (phone only)  
No vitals  
From hx sounds mechanical R hip pain with ↓ abduction groin site no red flag features septic arthritis fracture or malignancy on history today  

Impression  
1. Hx Legg Calve Perthes disease R hip childhood now progressive loss of abduction and intermittent mechanical groin pain ?residual deformity / early OA R hip  
2. Occupational load likely exacerbating symptoms  
No red flags today but needs in person review and imaging  

Plan  
– Book F2F within 3–5 days for full MSK hip exam gait ROM Trendelenburg leg length etc standard 15 min appt booked  
– Will organise at that visit:  
   • Xray pelvis + R hip AP + lateral to assess joint space femoral head shape collapse OA etc likely via local imaging provider report via HealthLink  
   • If XR not conclusive but sx ongoing consider MRI hip and non urgent ortho review  
– Analgesia continue ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food avoid if GI upset  
– Likely non urgent referral to hip ortho once imaging back given age 32 heavy manual work and known Perthes sequelae  
– Brief advice re activity modification at work avoid deep squats high impact as able  

Safety net  
If sudden severe hip pain inability to weight bear trauma fevers or rapid worsening limp to see GP/ED urgently RTC if worse or any concern  

Results  
No recent hip imaging on file checked Best Practice and HealthLink today last imaging >10 yrs ago so essentially nil current baseline awaiting new films once ordered
