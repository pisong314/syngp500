62F c/o “bad headaches + dizzy turns”  

HPI  
– 1–2/52 intermittent occipital/temporal “pressure” HA, up to 6/10, worse ↑ from bed / bending. Mins–1hr, settles w rest / Panadol. No photophobia/phonophobia/aura. No focal neurology. Mild nausea only  
– Vertigo x months, ↑ last 2/52. Triggered rolling in bed / looking up / lying flat esp to R. “Room spins for a few seconds”, <30s, settles if head still. Similar to previous. No hearing loss / tinnitus / aural fullness  
– Hx vestibular neuritis ~2y ago, residual imbalance. Dx BPPV prev (R post canal)  

Meds  
– Prochlorperazine 5mg TDS PRN vertigo – ran out, poor adherence  
– No regular meds  

O/E (focused)  
BP 148/88 (prev 138/84 last yr) HR 78 afeb  
Neuro grossly non-focal, CN intact, gait normal  
Dix-Hallpike R: +ve – reproduces vertigo + torsional/upbeat nystagmus ~20–25s, fatigues  
Dix-Hallpike L: -ve  
No meningism, no red flag neuro signs  

Imp  
1) BPPV R post canal – recurrent, typical hx + +ve R Hallpike  
2) Tension / cervicogenic type HA likely 2° neck strain + BPPV flare. No red flag features today  
3) Hx vestibular neuritis – stable residual imbalance  
4) Borderline HTN – needs repeat / CV risk workup later  

Plan  
– Explained benign BPPV, positional nature  
– Epley manoeuvre R done in rooms x1 – transient vertigo/nausea, then settled  
– Brandt-Daroff exs taught, handout given – advised BD at home bd for 1/52 if can remember  
– Prochlorperazine 5mg PO up to TDS PRN severe vertigo/nausea max 2/7 only. Rx 10 tabs no rpt. Warned drowsy → no driving if affected  
– Analgesia: paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/day). Avoid NSAIDs for now  
– Driving/safety: avoid driving / ladders / heights if active spins. Sit on edge of bed before standing  
– Ix: defer imaging – typical peripheral picture, normal neuro. Plan fasting bloods next visit (FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, BSL, ESR/CRP if HA persists/changes) + BP review/CV risk then  

F/up  
– Review 1/52 – reassess vertigo + HA, repeat BP, check if doing exs / using prochlorperazine / wants vestibular physio referral  
– If no improvement / pattern change → consider repeat Epley vs ENT  
– ED/urgent review if sudden severe “worst” HA, new neuro deficit, continuous vertigo, persistent vomiting etc.
