Ix today  
S&N / QML forms given:  
- FBC, U&E, LFT, uric acid (PET screen)  
- Urine PCR  
OGTT + antenatal summary + BP hx requested from hosp ANC (fax) – still pending  

A  
1) GDM – suboptimal control by hx, diet only so far. High‑risk (ATSI, BMI↑). Need actual BGL logs + OGTT report  
2) ↑BP in preg – ?PIH vs early PET. BP >140/90, trace protein but no red flags currently  
3) Preg 28+3, otherwise uncomplicated by hx  

P  
GDM  
- Provisional targets discussed: FBG ≤5.0, 1h post ≤7.4 (to confirm w hosp)  
- Given printed BGL chart → asked to use ONLY for sugars (not shopping lists)  
- Diet advice brief – ↓high GI (white bread/jam, sweets), spread carbs, encourage low‑GI options, short walks post‑meals if able  
- No meds started. Will decide insulin vs metformin if FBG/Post‑prand >targets once proper log + hosp plan in  

BP / ?PET  
- PET screen ordered as above + urine PCR  
- No anti‑HTN started in community today – will coordinate w ANC  
- Red flags explained: severe/persistent HA, visual changes, RUQ/epigastric pain, sudden ↑swelling face/hands, SOB, ↓FM, BP ≥160/110 if checked → straight to ED/maternity  

Coordination  
- Spoke briefly to ANC RN (with pt consent) → advised today’s BP + trace protein, they want results faxed when back. They confirm routine ANC appt in ~1/52 – will re‑check BP + consider formal dx/plan  
- Postpartum OGTT @ 6–12/52 noted for later (not discussed in detail today)  

F/U  
- Review here 3–4 days for BP + BGL review (longer appt 20 mins if poss)  
- Earlier if unwell / red flag sx  
- Separate std appt for non‑preg issues (knee pain etc) – deferred today due time  

Billing: Level C, bulk billed.
