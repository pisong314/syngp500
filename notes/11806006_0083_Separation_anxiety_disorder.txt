22/11/25 – Telehealth video (pt at home, Sydney)

Reason for consult:
Reveiw anxietty – ongoing seperation anx + agoraphobia, >12/12, worse last 6–8/12, partner now back in office 3 days/wk

HPI:
32 yr F, works part–time remote cust serv. Known seperation anx + agoraphobia, here for reveiw, no meds.

Main issue: marked distress when away from partner or home, most days.
– “If he goes out for the day I feel physically sick and I can’t focus on anything until he’s back”
– anticipitory anx night before he goes to work/social
– repetetive checking of his location / msgs, worries “something bad will happen and he won’t come home”
– avoids being alone outside home, will cancel/delay appts if partner cant come, uses grocery delivery
– difficulty sleeping if partner not in flat, waits awake til he returns, occas nightmares re him “going missing” or accident
– somatic sx when he about to leave (abdo tightness, nausea, mild HA) → settles when he home
– remote work from home “suits me but lets me avoid going anywhere”

Last ~2/12 worse with his office days ↑. ↑ coffee those mornings “to calm my nerves” but feels it makes anx worse. Also heavy news / phone use, feels this ↑ jittery.

No current psych meds. Had ~8 CBT sessions earlier this yr (priv psych) for GAD/agoraphobia, helped but stopped when MHCP sessions finished / cost. Motivated to re-engage: “I know the homework helped… I just need some structure again.”

Mood: no clear MDE. Denies persistant low mood, still enjoys drawing, shows, online gaming. No hopelessness, no anhedonia, no SI, no self harm thoughts.

Agoraphobia:
– avoids PT and busy indoor spaces alone
– can walk short distance around block if partner with her
– Telehealth OK, high distress re unfamiliar places alone.

Substances: rare ETOH (1–2 drinks/month), no illicits, non smoker. Caffiene ~3–4 coffees/day, more on “stress days”.

PMHx: dx separation anx + agoraphobia ~18/12 ago by prev GP. No psych hosp, no mania/psychosis, no SH. Otherwise well, no reg meds, NKDA.

Exam (video, limited):
Neat, good hygeine, at desk. Calm but clearly anx. Cooperative, good eye contact via camera. Speech normal. Mood “anxious”, affect congruent, reactive. Thought form linear, content dominated by worries re partner safety / being alone. No SI, no psychosis. No obvious resp distress, colour looks normal. Cogn grossly intact, good insight.

No obs avail today (tele). Pt reports last BP at path 3/12 ago “normal”. No red flag physical sx volunteered.

Dx:
1) Separation anxiety disorder – chronic, active, functionally impairing
2) Agoraphobia – comorbid, signif avoidance
3) No current MDE or other primary psych d/o evident today
Psychosocial: partner back in office, financial constraint re therapy.

Plan:
– Psychoed (brief) re adult separation anx + agoraphobia, treatable, CBT first line.
– Caffiene: advised ↓ to max 1–2 coffees/day, esp avoid ↑ intake on “high anx” mornings.
– Suggested limit doom–scrolling / news as trigger.

Psychological:
– Will organise updated GP Mental Health Treatment Plan (MHTP) – needs long appt ~30 mins. Asked pt to book long tele within 1–2 wks.
– Pt to contact prev psychologist re ongoing CBT; if not possible will refer to local psych with anx/agoraphobia experiance.
– Focus of therapy: graded exposure (short seperations + brief outings alone near home), cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts, building independent activites when partner away.
– Brief self–help: small tasks while partner out (eg short walk near unit, phone friend), grounding/breathing; mentioned online programs (MindSpot / This Way Up) – will email links.

Meds:
– No psychotropics started. Explained SSRIs (eg sertraline, escitalopram) may be considered if sx worsen / MDE / GAD prominent or therapy access limited. Discussed onset 4–6/52, common SE, non–addictive vs benzos.
– Pt prefers to prioritise therapy, meds as backup – agreed.

Risk:
– No SI/HI, no SH, no substance misuse.
– Safety net: advised to seek urgent care / ED / 000 or Lifeline 13 11 14 if SI or feels unsafe; RTC if marked deterioration, cant work, or agoraphobia worsens such that can’t leave flat even with partner.

Investigations:
– None today. At next in–person or if starting SSRI, consider baseline screen (BP, wt, fasting lipids/glucose, TFTs) to excl med contributors if sx change.

Follow up:
– Book long (30 min) tele within 1–2 wks for full mental health asses + MHTP and formal psych referral.
– Sooner review if rapid worsening or wants to discuss starting SSRI.

Pt understanding:
Engaged, asking about med dependance and prognosis. States will cut back coffee and book longer appt. Appears to understand and agrees with plan.
