42F teacher – f/up chronic loose stools/bloating + new “swelling”  

PC  
“Feel puffy – tummy + hands – like I’m swollen”  
Hx very vague re onset (says 1/52 → “since winter”)  

Hx  
Abdo “swelling” = more bloating/fullness LLQ/central, worse pm/after meals → better o/night  
No focal lump, no SOB/PND/orthopnoea, no CP, no facial/tongue/lip swell, no rash/itch  
No dysphagia, no urinary sx, no PR blood/melaena, no wt loss that she’s noticed  
Longstanding loose stools (≥6/12) known – prev w/up 3/12 ago: FBC/U&E/LFT/CRP/TSH/coeliac all N, stool M/C/S + O/C N, faecal calprotectin N (per EMR)  
No IBD/coeliac dx, no liver/renal/cardiac hx  

Meds  
Loperamide PRN per EMR (pt poor recall “little white pill for tummy”)  
No NSAIDs/metformin recorded  

O/E  
Obs: BP 118/74 HR 76 RR 14 SpO₂ 99% RA T 36.7 BMI 24.9  
CVS/Resp: HS dual, no murmur, JVP not ↑, chest clear  
Abdo: mild distension only, soft NT, no guarding/rebound, no masses, no HSM, BS N, no shifting dullness  
Periph: no pitting oedema, legs symm, rings not tight on exam  
Skin: no urticaria/angioedema  

Impr  
1) Sensation of “swelling” – no objective oedema, no signs CCF/renal/liver failure → likely subjective bloating related to functional bowel disorder  
2) Chronic loose stools/bloating >6/12 – prev normal bloods/stools + N calprotectin → functional diarrhoea / IBS-D spectrum, pain minimal  
No current red flags on hx/exam  

Plan  
– Reassured re no clinical oedema / organ failure today  
– Symptom + food diary 2–3/52 (meals, Bristol stool, bloating, stress)  
– Diet: simple advice only today – ↓caffeine, ↓fatty foods, avoid “detox”/Mg laxatives etc  
– Meds: continue loperamide PRN; clarified dose 2mg after loose stool, max 8mg/day (written on AVS)  

Ix (repeat as >3/12 since last set)  
– FBC, U&E, eGFR, LFT, CRP, coeliac serology, TSH (form given – on-site today if can, otherwise before next appt)  
– Faecal elastase to r/o pancreatic insufficiency  

If ongoing sx / any red flags (wt loss, nocturnal diarrhoea, PR blood, strong FHx Ca) → refer Gastro for colonoscopy ± further tests  

MH/stress  
– Briefly noted ↑school stress, likely contributing – no time today for full MH review  
– Plan longer appt to discuss stress/anxiety, possible gut-directed CBT etc  

Safety net  
– ED/urgent review if severe abdo pain, persistent vomiting, PR blood/black stool, fever, rapid wt loss, sudden facial/tongue/lip swell or SOB, new leg/abdo swelling with wt gain  

F/U  
– Review 3–4/52 (long appt) – results + diary, reassess bowels/bloating, consider Gastro referral  
– Printed summary with tests + loperamide instructions given (pt poor recall)  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – ignore, old recall in EMR, now superseded by above f/up.
