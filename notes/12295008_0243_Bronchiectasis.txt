Reason  
R/V bronchiectasis  
Pt: "you said you could still hear those crackles last time just want to make sure its not getting worse"  

HPI  
72F retired admin well known to practice non CF bronchiectasis dx HRCT ~5yrs ago prev resp clinic now GP led care annual r/v + PRN  

Today feels "pretty much the same as usual"  
Chronic AM productive cough same pattern "same cupful of gunk then it settles"  
Sputum yellow baseline nil ↑ vol nil ↑ thickness nil smell  
Nil ↑ cough nil ↑ SOB nil change exercise tol still walks dog 20–30min most days just slower uphill  
Nil fever chills night sweats chest pain  
Nil haemoptysis for "months"  
Nil recent abx or hosp last 6–9/12  
Reliever salb MDI 1–2x/month only cold weather wheeze  

Pt concerns  
Worried persistent crackles mean "lungs wearing out quicker"  
Asks if cold damp weather or "mould in the bathroom" making lungs "rattlier"  
Query repeat CT "to see if it’s spreading"  

Red flags  
Nil orthopnoea PND ankle swelling wt loss appetite ok  

Background bronchiectasis (per old resp letters + EMR + pt)  
HRCT bronchiectasis RLL + lingula idiopathic post recurrent pneumonias in 50s  
Prev imm CF ABPA screens normal  
Usually 1–2 infective exacerbations/yr on oral abx none so far this yr  
Has written action plan sputum MCS + oral abx if ↑ sputum vol/purulence + ↑ cough/SOB ≥48h ED if sig haemoptysis or severe SOB  
Airway clearance ACBT + huffing most mornings adherence "most days unless I sleep in" nil devices  

SHx  
Never smoker nil passive smoke  
Lives with husband independent ADLs  
Old home some bathroom mould cleans regularly husband not particularly worried says "its been like that for yrs"  

PMHx  
Bronchiectasis as above  
Other chronic issues not covered today full CDM deferred long appt  

Meds (resp)  
Salbutamol MDI 100mcg 1–2 puffs PRN SOB rare use  
Nil ICS LABA nebs O2  
NKDA  

Exam  
Obs BP 132/74 HR 76 reg RR 16 SpO2 96% RA T 36.6 BMI 25  
Gen alert comfortable speaking full sentences  
Resp chest expansion sym percussion resonant bilat coarse insp crackles bibasal esp RLL L base unchanged post deep breaths/cough nil focal bronchial breathing nil wheeze nil ↑ WOB  
CVS HS dual nil murmur nil periph oedema  
ENT nil nasal polyps nil sinus tend  
No clubbing no sig LN  

Impression  
1 Non CF bronchiectasis clinically stable persistent coarse bibasal crackles in keeping with known structural disease nil current evidence acute exacerbation (nil ↑ cough sputum vol/viscosity purulence SOB fatigue haemoptysis)  
2 Pt anxiety re disease progression + ausc findings  
3 Nil current features pneumonia CCF or active haemoptysis  

Clinical reasoning  
Stable symptoms functional status and obs with chronic coarse crackles localised to known areas of bronchiectasis most consistent with baseline airway distortion + mucus plugging rather than new parenchymal process  
Given absence of systemic features or deterioration repeat HRCT today not indicated CT mainly for initial dx or change in phenotype / suspected complication as per national bronchiectasis guidance  
Heart failure unlikely given clear CVS exam no oedema nil orthopnoea/PND sats normal  

Plan  

# Bronchiectasis – stable  
Explained persistent crackles common in established bronchiectasis due to dilated airways + retained secretions do not necessarily imply rapid decline when exacerbation frequency low and exercise tol stable  
Reassured pattern of ≤2 exacerbations/yr and nil this yr is favourable prognostically  

CT  
Discussed role HRCT largely dx + reassessment if ↑ symptoms haemoptysis or ?complication  
Given stable course exam consistent with prior findings and normal obs agreed to defer CT unless clinical change pt comfortable with this  

# Non pharmacological  
Reinforced daily airway clearance importance advised continue ACBT + huffing each morning suggested avoid skipping even when "feeling lazy" as helps mucus clearance and ↓ infection risk  
Offered re-referral resp physio for technique optimisation + consideration of PEP/OPEP device pt keen referral sent to local resp physio service  

Exercise  
Encouraged ongoing walking most days as tolerated noted benefit for mucociliary clearance cardioresp fitness  

Environment  
Discussed bathroom mould likely minor contributor in context of otherwise stable disease but reasonable to minimise damp ensure ventilation clean visible mould regularly monitor for any correlation with symptom flares  

# Vaccinations  
Checked EMR influenza vaccine given this yr pneumococcal booster >5yrs ago  
Plan nurse appt to confirm pneumococcal schedule completion and give booster if due time limited today so not completed  

# Meds  
Nil change to salbutamol PRN no indication ICS/LABA in absence of asthma/COPD or sig exertional SOB  
Nil abx indicated today as nil infective features  

# Investigations  
No immediate bloods or imaging clinically stable good sats  
Annual spirometry overdue >12/12 booking form given for nurse / resp lab to arrange baseline for ongoing monitoring of FEV1 trend as per guideline approach  

# Education / action plan  
Reviewed existing written exacerbation action plan  
If ≥3 of ↑ cough ↑ sputum vol/thickness ↑ purulence ↑ SOB/reduced exercise tol ↑ fatigue or any haemoptysis persisting ≥48h → attend GP promptly sputum MCS prior to abx where poss  
ED/000 if large vol haemoptysis severe SOB or chest pain  
Pt able to repeat key triggers knows to collect sputum jar from reception husband aware to bring her in if "more crook than usual"  

Follow up  
R/V 6/12 for bronchiectasis and spirometry results or earlier PRN per action plan  
Book separate long appt in 4–6/52 for full chronic disease + meds r/v  

Pt agreed to plan
