22/11/25  Home visit – rural  F/U skin

78F known occ hand derm / atopy / psoriasis. Seen re “dermatitis on my hands + arms – no one can tell if it’s allergy”. Wants “one cream that fixes it”.

HPC  
>20y hx chronic hand/FA rash. Worse last 3–4/12. Burning/itch/cracks ± minor weep. Flares w dishes + “lemon” dish liquid + strong soaps. Using old betamethasone cream “when really bad” often multiple times/day for few days then stops. Emollient poor use (“forget”).  
No fevers, no new PO meds, no abx. Scratches at night. Sometimes hot water soaks.

PMHx (relevant)  
Occ contact derm hands (irritant ± allergic)  
Atopic derm  
Mild plaque psoriasis elbows/knees/scalp  
HTN, OA, CKD3 (eGFR ~55 last yr)  
NKDA

Meds (relevant)  
Irbesartan 150 mane  
Paracetamol PRN  
Betamethasone valerate 0.05% cream – expired, overused when flare  
Sorbolene (rarely used)  
Promethazine 10 nocte PRN itch – mostly not taking (too sedating)

Adherence poor. Missed prev derm appt (“too far, hate the bus”).

Daughter (by phone) confirms pt often runs out of creams + doesn’t ring for repeats.

Exam  
Obs ok: BP 138/76 HR 78 RR 16 afebrile SpO₂ 97% RA  
Hands/wrists dorsum: erythema, dry, lichenified, fissures, excoriations. No pus/cellulitis  
Palms: mild diffuse erythema/scale only  
Extensor FA: scattered dry erythematous patches  
Elbows: well-demarcated erythematous plaques w silvery scale c/w psoriasis  
No nail pitting. No urticaria/angioedema

A  
1) Chronic hand/FA derm – mixed picture:  
   - cumulative irritant contact (wet work, detergents, fragranced soaps etc)  
   - ?allergic contact (hx latex rxn, fragranced products, no patch test)  
   - underlying atopic eczema → barrier ↓  
   Mod flare today, no 2° infection  
2) Mild plaque psoriasis elbows – stable  
3) Poor adherence + access issues (rural, transport) → driving poor control

P  
Time limited – focus skin only. Other chronic dz review next visit.

1) Avoidance / barrier  
– Adv stop fragranced bar soap + “lemon” dish liquid → use soap-free wash (e.g. QV/Cetaphil)  
– ↑ emollient: sorbolene / plain ointment ≥3–4x/day esp post handwash  
– Non-latex (nitrile/vinyl) gloves for dishes/cleaning ± cotton liners. Avoid hot water, prolonged wet work  
(briefly explained irritant vs allergic vs atopic overlap – not easily separable, mgmt same re barrier)

2) Topical Rx  
– Cease old betamethasone  
– Start mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment (PBS)  
   • Hands/wrists + FA + elbows: thin layer nocte x 7–10d then alt nights x 1/52 then stop; continue emollient  
   • Max OD, avoid face/groin, not >2/52 continuous  
– Scripts:  
   • Mometasone 0.1% oint 45g x 1 + 1 rpt  
   • Sorbolene 500g tub x 1 + 3 rpts

3) Itch  
– Start cetirizine 10 mg mane PRN itch x 1–2/52 (CKD3 – dose ok)  
– Promethazine discouraged (falls/sedation) – reserve only if severe nocturnal itch

4) Derm / patch testing  
– Discussed benefit patch testing (rubber accelerators, fragrance, preservatives etc) given hx latex + chronicity  
– Referral to nearest regional derm svc for contact derm assessment + patch test if possible  
   Pt ambivalent (“I’ll see”) – likely poor follow-through. Suggested daughter attend + look at community transport

5) Adherence / supports  
– Emphasised emollient = main long-term Rx  
– Asked daughter to put written plan on fridge + check creams weekly, call clinic before they run out  
– Note: chronic non-compliance – keep regimen simple

6) F/U / safety net  
– Review 2/52 – home visit if possible (or earlier if ↑redness, pain, pus, fevers, spreading rash)  
– Next visit: assess response, check for steroid atrophy, reinforce avoidance, re-check derm referral (consider telederm if can’t travel)  
– Plan U&E/eGFR and HTN/CKD review at separate appt 4–6/52

Bulk billed. Nurse to phone in 3–4 days to confirm scripts filled + using creams.
