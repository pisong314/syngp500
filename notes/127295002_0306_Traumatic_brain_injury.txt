P  
1 Throat sx / probable LPR + globus  
   Reassured benign exam explained globus common post URTI + reflux often self limiting may take wks–mths  
   Lifestyle advice given re reflux  
   - ↓ energy drinks aim ≤1/day then taper  
   - Avoid large late meals finish >3h pre bed  
   - Limit spicy fatty takeaway alcohol chocolate peppermint  
   - Elevate head of bed prefer blocks/wedge rather than sleeping on couch  

   Meds  
   - Start PPI trial 4–6/52  
     Esomeprazole 20mg PO mane 30min pre breakfast

   If sx persist >6–8/52 despite PPI + lifestyle or any red flags →  
   - ENT ref for nasoendoscopy
