22/11/25  After hours GP – new pt, no records

C/o “throat feels weird, kind of tight” x ~3 days.

Middle‑aged woman, office job. Very anxious today, keeps saying “I’m really worried it’s cancer or a blood clot stuck in my throat”.

Hx more globus than true dysphagia – feels tight lower throat / upper chest esp when swallowing saliva, needs to clear throat a bit. Eats/drinks ok, no food getting stuck, no choking, no pain swallowing. No SOB, no wheeze, no stridor, no chest pain. Says mild on/off heartburn last few weeks, worse with coffee/spicy food, a bit worse lying down at night. Started OTC antacid yesterday, “burning behind my breastbone a bit better”.

Past: unprovoked DVT L leg ~8 months ago (pt report only, no letters), did 6/12 rivaroxaban then stopped ~2 months ago. No current leg swelling/pain, no recent travel, surgery etc. Very focused on “could a clot have gone to my lungs or throat”.

Non‑smoker, occasional alcohol. Describes herself as “a bit of a worrier, I google everything”.

Ex: looks anxious but well, talking full sentences.
Obs: BP 128/78, HR 84 reg, RR 16, SpO₂ 99% RA, afebrile.
Throat/neck: mouth and oropharynx look normal, no redness, no exudate, no obvious masses, uvula midline, neck soft, no lymph nodes or palpable lumps, thyroid not enlarged.
Chest: clear, good air entry, no wheeze/crackles, no added heart sounds.
Legs: no asymmetry or tenderness.

No red flag features elicited for malignancy, airway compromise, PE or recurrent DVT at this stage.

Impression (a bit all over the place):
– Globus sensation, likely reflux‑related +/- anxiety component  
– GORD symptoms mild  
– Hx unprovoked DVT, currently off anticoag, no evidence of recurrence today  
– Marked health anxiety

Plan:
– Trial PPI: esomeprazole 20 mg mane (30–60 mins before breakfast) for 2–4 weeks.  
– Brief reflux advice given (avoid late/spicy/coffee for now, elevate head of bed etc – not documented in detail).  
– Reassured re: low likelihood of clot/cancer based on current story and exam, explained DVT/PE usually presents with leg swelling or chest symptoms, not isolated throat tightness with normal obs.

Tests: none ordered tonight – no clear indication for urgent bloods/imaging in this setting, will leave baseline/pathology to usual GP. (Pt asked for “full body check and every blood test” – declined, discussed reasons.)

Follow‑up:
– Needs long appt with usual GP in next 1–2 weeks to:
   • review old DVT notes/results  
   • consider need for ongoing anticoagulation / thrombophilia screen  
   • review response to PPI and consider ENT/OGD if persisting or any new red flags  
   • address health anxiety, possible MHCP/psychology.

Safety net: attend ED/after hours if develops difficulty swallowing food/fluids, choking, noisy breathing, rapidly worsening pain/swelling, fever, chest pain, SOB, haemoptysis, or new unilateral leg swelling/pain.

Time short, other issues (air‑con mould, detergent irritation, “general health check”) deferred to usual GP.
