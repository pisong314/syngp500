S  
72 y/o woman walk in new to clinic  
C/O painful “clotted vein” R calf  

HPI  
Onset 7/7 ago red tender cord medial R calf over known VV  
Pain initially ↑ over 2–3/7 now stable/slightly beter esp w elevation and PRN panadol  
Describes “lumpy rope under skin” pain to 6/10 on walking mild itch  
Nil trauma nil cannulae or injections to leg  
Nil fevers rigors NS nil CP SOB palps haemoptysis  
No sig calf swelling away from area nil groin or thigh pain  
Mobility ↓ a bit but still walking shorter distances  

Background venous disease  
Longstanding VV both legs since 40s R>L uses OTC “support stockings” not proper compression  
Hx recurrent venous ulcers L medial malleolus last active ~6/12 ago now healed  
Told has “poor circulation” intermittent calf ache on longer walks no rest pain no foot ulcers  

Meds (self rpt)  
Aspirin 100 mg mane “for circulation”  
Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte  
Perindopril 5 mg mane  
Paracetamol 1 g up to TDS PRN using 2–3 doses/day past wk  
Nil anticoagulant nil regular NSAID  

Allergies  
NKDA  

PMHx  
VV with chronic venous insufficiency  
Venous leg ulcers L>R currently healed  
Peripheral arterial disease (no known MI/CVA)  
HTN HLD  

SHx  
Lives alone in unit independent ADLs daughter nearby supportive  
Ex smoker 30 pack yr quit 10 yrs ago  
Walks to local shops most days limited by leg discomfort  
On pension bulk billing important  

ROS (focused)  
Nil recent surg immobilisation long haul flights HRT or known malignancy  
Nil wt loss NS anorexia  
Nil current leg wounds ooze spreading cellulitis

Vitals  
BP 136/74 HR 78 reg RR 16 SpO₂ 98% RA Temp 36.8 BMI ~27  

CVS HS dual nil murmur  
Resp clear bilat  

Legs  
Prominent tortuous VV along GSV territory bilat R>L  
R medial calf mid–distal third 7–8 cm firm tender cord along varicose vein erythema band ~3 cm warm not fluctuant nil pus skin intact  
No palpable extension proximally to knee/thigh nil groin tend  
Calf size R≈L nil generalised oedema  

L leg healed hyperpigmented scar medial malleolus c/w prev venous ulcer mild pitting oedema ankle  
Chronic venous skin changes bilat  

Pulses  
DP diminished bilat PT hard to palpate feet warm CRT ~3s nil rest pain  

Neuro LL grossly intact  

A  
1 Superficial venous thrombosis R medial calf over VV  
   Clinically uncomplicated nil systemic features nil cellulitis nil DVT/PE sx  
   Length ~7–8 cm location vs SFJ/SPJ uncertain → needs USS to risk stratify and decide on anticoag  

2 Chronic venous disease VV + hx venous ulcers now healed  
   Ongoing high risk recurrence currently only light non‑graduated stockings  

3 Peripheral arterial disease stable claudication only  
   Needs further vascular risk optimisation ABPI before strong compression  

P  
1 Investigations  
   - Urgent duplex venous USS R LL today/tomorrow  
     • confirm SVT length  
     • measure distance from SFJ/SPJ  
     • exclude DVT  
   - Baseline bloods today FBC U&E/Cr LFTs prior to any anticoag  
   - Lipids HbA1c etc to be done at later chronic dz r/v  

2 SVT symptomatic tx (interim pending USS)  
   - Topical NSAID preferred given age + aspirin  
     • Rx diclofenac 1% gel apply thin layer to tender cord QID PRN up to 7/7 avoid broken skin  
   - Continue paracetamol PRN max 4 g/24h  
   - Leg elevation when resting gentle walking avoid prolonged standing where possible  
   - Can continue usual light support stockings avoid very tight poorly fitting garments  

3 Anticoagulation plan (provisional)  
   - Explained to pt clot in surface vein small but real risk spread to deep system or lung  
   - If USS shows short segment <5 cm & >3 cm from junctions → likely NSAID + conservative only  
   - If >5 cm & >3 cm from deep system → consider prophylactic anticoag 45/7 eg rivaroxaban 10 mg mane if CrCl ≥30 or LMWH  
   - Will weigh bleeding risk age 72 on aspirin PAD once bloods + USS back  

4 Chronic venous disease / PAD  
   - Needs ABPI or vascular lab assessment before ↑compression  
   - Consider vascular surgeon ref once acute SVT sorted for VV management ulcer prevention  
   - Longer chronic disease consult planned re PAD walking program antiplatelet/statin review etc  

5 Meds  
   - Continue aspirin 100 mg atorvastatin 20 mg perindopril 5 mg usual doses  
   - Avoid starting oral NSAID today given age + aspirin + ?renal fxn will reconsider if pain not controlled and bloods OK  

Safety net  
   - Advised ED if sudden ↑ leg pain or swelling esp up into thigh  
   - Or new SOB CP haemoptysis feeling acutely unwell  
   - Or spreading hot red area fevers ?cellulitis  

F/U  
   - USS requested within 24–48h form given asked to attend today if can  
   - GP r/v 3–4/7 to check USS + bloods finalise need for anticoag  
   - Arrange longer chronic vascular/PAD f/u within next 2–3/52 once acute issue settled
