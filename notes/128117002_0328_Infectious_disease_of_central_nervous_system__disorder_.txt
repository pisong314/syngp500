A  
1 Visual disturbance + tinnitus / mild hearing impairment  
In context recent cryptococcal meningitis on tx immunosuppressed  
Today exam reassuring afebrile nil meningism nil focal neurology nil papilloedema VA near normal subjective sx mild stable 1–2/52  
Likely 2° combo previous raised ICP inner ear/optic pathway effects vs med effect vs anxiety/somatic focus  
Low suspicion acute relapse today still needs close specialist f/u  

2 Cryptococcal meningitis recent  
On appropriate consolidation fluconazole per discharge summary needs ID oversight for duration ± repeat imaging/LP as indicated  

3 Immunosuppressed state  
On pred + MMF + PJP proph high risk OI nil current infective sx  

4 Health anxiety / illness anxiety traits  
Marked catastrophising heavy google use repeated reassurance seeking ↓sleep impacting QOL  

P  
Discussed overall picture reassuring today explained absence of red flags and that urgent CT/MRI or LP not indicated currently  

1 Visual + hearing sx  
- Safety net given red flag list for urgent ED/000  
  severe or rapidly ↑HA fever >38.5C neck stiffness vomiting confusion new weakness or numbness seizures sudden visual loss double vision sudden marked change hearing or balance incontinence or collapse  
- Non urgent tests ordered  
  • Audiology pure tone audiogram + tymps quantify loss guide ENT/ID  
  • Optometry / Ophthalmology ref public eye clinic for formal VA VF check for optic neuropathy raised ICP sequelae  
- Will send secure msg / letter to treating ID today update on sx + exam ask if they want earlier r/v than planned 3/52 or arrange repeat MRI/LP  

2 Cryptococcal meningitis / meds  
- Continue fluconazole 400 mg mane pred 10 mg mane MMF 1 g BD and TMP/SMX as per current plan until ID / rheum advise taper  
- Emphasised adherence not to cease antifungal early  
- Ordered bloods today  
  • FBC U&E LFTs CRP monitor for drug tox + occult infection  
  (Prev LFTs WNL 4/52 ago as above)  

3 Immunosuppression advice  
- Reinforced infection precautions early GP r/v for fever cough urinary sx skin infection etc  

4 Health anxiety  
- Validated fears post serious illness  
- Advised that ongoing googling is feeding anxiety suggested limiting health searches  
- Brief intro to psych support CBT for health anxiety esp someone experienced with Aboriginal clients  
- Plan longer 30 min appt 1–2/52 for MHCP ?psych ref screening K10 GAD7 and coping with chronic illness  

5 Social / cultural  
- Pt reports good support from sister and local ACCHO  
- Pt happy for info sharing with ACCHO GP will send summary if required  

Follow up  
- Std r/v 1/52 to check blood results and sx can convert to longer if needed  
- Longer MH focussed appt 1–2/52 as above (may coincide same day  if bookings allow)  
- ED/000 if any neuro red flags as per safety net above  

Pt remained somewhat anxious asking “are you sure we shouldnt do more tests” multiple times reassurance given that we are monitoring closely liaising with ID will escalate if any change  

Mgmt plan discussed pt agreed  

(Resp safety net auto text) pt advised to return if fever >38.5C severe SOB chest pain or confusion or if symptoms persist or worsen r/v PRN
