42yo F, retail, Anglo-Aus – review R foot pain / CRPS  

C/o last 3–4 wks R foot “skin is so tender, feels like it’s on fire if anything brushes it, even the sheet”. Says can’t keep sock on for long, “standing on the hard floor all day is no good”. Known CRPS R foot post 5th MT # ~7 mths ago.  

Pain baseline burning/tingling ~5/10, up to 8/10 after shifts. Worse with foot down for long periods at work, a bit better with elevation, cool packs. No new trauma. No fevers, no back pain, no radicular sx. No red flag neuro sx reported. Sleep sometimes disturbed when sheets touch foot (2–3 nights/wk). Mood frustrated but coping, denies low mood/suicidal thoughts.  

Meds: pregabalin 75mg BD – taking regularly, notes mild dizziness for 30–45 mins after AM dose, “a bit woozy but I’m alright, no falls”. Paracetamol 1g PRN up to TDS on busy days. Avoids NSAIDs (dyspepsia). No other regular meds. NKDA.  

She’s worried: “Is this a sign it’s getting worse again?” and asking what else can be done to stop long-term damage. Still working ~20–25 hrs/wk on feet.  

Obs today: BP 118/76, HR 78, afebrile, sats 99% RA. Looks well, a bit guarded with R foot.  

R foot/ankle (brief): mild erythema/mottling dorsum vs L, mild non-pitting oedema. Warmer to touch than L. Marked allodynia to light touch dorsum/lateral foot to just above ankle, hyperalgesia pinprick. Ankle ROM slightly ↓ due to pain but no fixed deformity, power essentially normal, gait mildly antalgic but can heel/toe with encouragement. Pulses DP/PT 2+ bilat, cap refill normal. Reflexes normal at ankles, no proximal sensory loss.  

Impression:  
– CRPS R foot – ongoing, flare of hyperaesthesia/allodynia, functionally limiting but no evidence of infection/DVT/new radiculopathy.  
– Pregabalin-related mild dizziness – tolerable currently.  

Plan (limited time, standard appt):  
- Continue pregabalin 75mg BD for now – monitor dizziness, warned re driving if more symptomatic.  
- Start amitriptyline 10mg nocte x 1 wk then ↑ to 20mg nocte if tolerating (for neuropathic pain, sleep). Discussed common SEs (sedation, dry mouth, constipation, next-day drowsiness), avoid alcohol excess.  
- Paracetamol PRN – clarified max 4g/day (she usually ≤3g).  
- Avoid regular NSAIDs given hx dyspepsia – short course only if absolutely needed with food (not emphasised).  
- Opioids not indicated – explained limited role in CRPS.  

- Non-pharm: continue physio/desensitisation, hydro. Advised pacing/micro-breaks at work, softer/cushioned footwear as able. Elevation and cool (not ice) packs for comfort.  

- Will message current physio via secure messaging with brief update re flare + new amitriptyline, ask to review graded motor imagery / mirror therapy / work pacing.  

- Already known to pain clinic (seen ~3 mths ago). Will send updated letter today requesting earlier review for optimisation of neuropathic regimen ± other options (e.g. ketamine / interventional if deteriorating). Advised she can contact them if worsening before next booked appt.  

- Safety net: if sudden ↑ swelling, marked colour change esp. pale/cool foot, new weakness or numbness, fever or feels systemically crook → ED/urgent review. Asked to let us know if dizziness worsens, confusion, palpitations, mood change or any suicidal thoughts on new meds.  

No tests today – picture consistent with CRPS flare, no alternative dx suggested clinically. Consider baseline bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, TSH) if further med titration next visit.  

Follow-up: review 2 wks to check response/tolerance to amitriptyline, reassess pain, sleep, function, consider pregabalin adjustment. Separate longer appt in 1–2 mths for general health check (she’ll book).  

Pt agreeable to plan, engaged, good adherence reported.  

09:24 – quick addendum: reiterated this flare doesn’t necessarily mean permanent worsening; focus on keeping her moving and at work as able. RTC earlier if no improvement or any concerns.
