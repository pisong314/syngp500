Ix reviewed (MyHR)  
CT chest 10/7  
LLL cavitating lesion ~3.5cm with air fluid level surrounding consolidation c/w lung abscess post pneumonia  
Nil clear mass nil mediastinal LAD nil empyema  
Rec rpt imaging 4–6/52 to ensure resolution / exclude underlying malignancy  
CXR prior LLL consolidation ?cavity  
Bloods in hosp WCC 15→9.8 CRP 180→45 U&E LFTs essentially N blood cultures x2 NG  

Assessment  
1 Lung abscess LLL post pneumonia improving clinically on oral abx vitals stable O2 sats N  high risk due to chronic steroids  malignancy less likely given acute course + response but cannot fully exclude until rpt CT  
2 Immune compromise 2° long term pred  ↑risk complicated infection  
3 GORD  poss aspiration risk esp lying flat after meals currently on PPI  
4 Access / remote context  will need support for imaging transport telehealth f/u  

Plan  
1 Lung abscess  
- Complete current 10/7 Augmentin course as per hosp  
- Extend oral abx due to abscess + steroids  
  → new script Augmentin Duo Forte 875/125 BD further 4/52 PBS  
- Rpt CT chest with contrast in ~4–6/52 request sent to nearest radiology via clinic fax  AHW to assist booking + transport  
- If rpt CT shows persistent cavity or ?underlying lesion → resp ref public clinic ± bronchoscopy  

Safety net  
Advised urgent ED / 000 if  
fever or rigors recur  
↑SOB esp with simple tasks or cant speak full sentences  
worsening or sharp pleuritic chest pain  
coughing up blood  
feeling much more unwell confused or very weak  
Reinforced she is not "a bother" given steroids low threshold to present family encouraged to bring her in early  

2 Immune compromise / steroids  
- Continue pred 10mg mane as per rheum plan nil change today  
- Reinforced infection risk early r/v if any deterioration  

3 GORD / aspiration  
- Continue pantoprazole 40mg mane  
- Simple advice avoid lying flat straight after big meals head of bed slightly elevated  

4 Monitoring / tests  
- Path form to local clinic for 1/7  
  FBC CRP U&E LFTs while on prolonged abx  
- Nurse / AHW to recheck BP HR SpO₂ at same visit  

5 Preventive / chronic issues (deferred today time)  
- To address next longer appt  
  long term steroid mgmt bone health DEXA  
  vaccines pneumo flu COVID booster  
  DM screen given borderline BSL hx  

Follow up  
- Telehealth r/v 1/7 after bloods booked via clinic  
- Telehealth again ~5–6/52 once CT done to discuss results  
- Earlier in person / ED if red flags as above or if AHW/family concerned
