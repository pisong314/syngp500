22/11/25   Tel consult (bulk billed, pt at home, wife in background)

Reason for call:  
Booked as “protein loss with frequent drainage – fluid keeps coming back in my tummy” + “a few things I wanted to mention today”. Ended up mainly ascites issues, other bits deferred.

HPI (bit all over the place)  
72‑yo man, metastatic colorectal Ca, known malignant ascites, has tunnelled peritoneal drain put in ~6 wks ago by oncology. Wife drains at home.

Says tummy “keeps blowing up, feels tight and I get puffed, then we let it out”. Draining “about 2 to 3 litres every second day”, was told by oncology nurse can go “up to 4 litres a day if I have to”.  
Worried: “I reckon I’m losing all my protein down the hose, that’s why my arms are getting skinny… should I be smashing the protein shakes or more eggs so it doesn’t drain out?” Also asked if bore water is “washing the salts out of me” – reassured more likely cancer/ascitic losses, not the water.

Symptoms today:
- Abdomen distends between drains, improves after  
- Mild SOB when tense ascites, on phone speaking full sentences, no acute SOB at rest  
- Bowels moving daily, softer, no PR bleed. No vomiting, no colicky pain, no absolute constipation  
- No fevers/rigors, no new focal severe abdo pain, no confusion  
- Gets “a bit woozy” if they “let the whole lot run out quick”; wife says now trying to slow it over a couple of hours but “hard not to just let it run out”.

Other bits he tried to raise: R shoulder sore when pruning roses, “funny toenail”, then “one more thing doc…” → explained need separate long F2F for these, not urgent vs cancer stuff today. He agreed (reluctantly, kept circling back).

PMHx (relevant only)  
- Metastatic colorectal Ca with malignant ascites (palliative intent, regional oncology)  
- Diverticular disease, no recent flares  
- Hx HTN (not discussed)  
- No known CKD on past records  
Allergies: NKDA (per file)

Meds (pt a bit vague)  
- “Water tablets” from oncology – likely spironolactone 50–100 mg od, ?+/- low‑dose frusemide – to confirm  
- Oral chemo from oncologist (likely capecitabine or similar, pt unsure name)  
- Paracetamol 1 g PRN  
- Laxatives PRN (senna/coloxyl)  
- Occasional omeprazole

Exam (phone only)  
No obs (home). Voice strong, not breathless during call. No slurring. Describes abdo “pretty big again but not as bad as when it’s really tight”. No features c/w acute peritonitis or obstruction by hx.

Assessment (messy but main points)  
1) Metastatic colorectal Ca with recurrent malignant ascites on tunnelled drain  
   - Draining ~2–3 L q48h for comfort  
   - Progressive weight/muscle loss, likely cancer + protein loss in ascites + ↓PO intake  
   - No current red flags for bowel obstruction or SBP/peritonitis by history  
   - On diuretics (?spironolactone ± frusemide) – needs UECs, LFTs/albumin, FBC

2) Postural/light‑headed with rapid large‑volume drainage  
   - Likely relative intravascular depletion when drained too fast/too much

3) Diverticular disease – stable, no acute symptoms

4) Misc minor issues (shoulder pain, toenail etc) – not addressed today, low priority vs palliative cancer care

Plan (kept fairly tight)  
Ascites / drainage  
- Emphasised drainage for comfort, not chasing exact volumes.  
- Suggested keep to max ~3–4 L per 24 hrs and run it out slowly over a few hours where possible.  
- If feels very dizzy, chest pain, marked SOB during drain → clamp, lie flat/legs up if safe, call 000/ED if not settling.

Protein / nutrition  
- Explained protein is lost in ascitic fluid, contributes to weakness/wasting; albumin infusions generally not routine in malignant ascites.  
- Encouraged small frequent, protein‑rich foods as tolerated incl eggs, dairy, meat, or supplement drinks if he likes them (didn’t go into diet detail).

Meds / monitoring  
- Will check exact diuretic regimen and chemo via oncology letter/med list.  
- For now continue current “water tablets” as he is not having syncope/falls, only mild postural sx when draining too quickly.  
- Pathology form to local collection centre (emailed + copy to lab):  
  - UEC, CMP (incl LFTs, albumin), FBC  
  - Aim: check Na/K esp with spironolactone, renal function, albumin.  
- Will consider diuretic adjustment once results back + after discussion with oncology, aligning with his goal of staying comfortable at home.

Red flags / safety net (brief)  
- To ED/000 if: new severe abdo pain, fever/rigors, confusion, much worse SOB, chest pain, persistent vomiting, no stool/flatus with abdo pain/distension, or pus/blood from drain.  
- Wife to keep an eye on drain site for redness, warmth, discharge, ↑pain → same‑day review if present.

Palliative / coordination  
- Will send short summary to oncology re: current drainage pattern, postural sx, concerns about protein loss.  
- Ask oncology if community palliative care already involved; if not, will refer to local palliative team for symptom + psychosocial support (pt agreeable).

Deferred issues  
- Shoulder pain with gardening, toenail, “list” of other minor concerns – asked to book 20–30 min long F2F in next 2–3 wks for these and general review. Reception to book as long appt.

Follow‑up  
- Review (phone or in person) in ~1 week after bloods, or earlier if oncology plan changes.  
- Attend ED/000 earlier if deterioration as above.

[Addendum 16:45 – Dr J. ***]  
Quick look at last oncology letter (3 wks old) – on capecitabine palliative regimen + spironolactone 50 mg od, NO frusemide listed. Will confirm still current at next review and re‑check after bloods.
