24yo Aboriginal F, known to practice (seen here before? also usually goes to AMS).  

C/O: “general check-up” but mostly itchy rash x ~3–4 wks.  

HPI (bit all over the place, needed lots of redirection):  
Working double shifts at pub, cousin had “heart thing” so she wanted a check. Eventually mentions “this itchy rash driving me mad at night”. Started wrists/hands, now between fingers, around waistline/lower tummy, inner thighs. Worse at night esp after late shifts. Tried moisturisers, changed washing powder (cheap brand since rent ↑) – no better. Picking → “pimples and scabs” on arms/legs, some yellow crust.  

Several in house also itchy at night – partner, younger sister, 2yo nephew. No one treated. Dog “always a bit scratchy” but no clear animal exposure otherwise. No fevers or feeling unwell.  

PMHx:  
- Hx scabies as a kid.  
- Hx skin sores/“penicillin needles for my skin and heart” childhood – ?ARF prophylaxis, no current Sx (no SOB, CP, joints ok, no sore throat).  
- Nil known chronic disease.  

Meds: paracetamol PRN.  
Allergies: NKDA.  
Social: lives in shared rental, some overcrowding, works hospo, money tight.  

Exam (focused):  
BP 112/70, HR 80, RR 14, Temp 36.9, SpO₂ 99% RA, BMI 24. Looks well.  
Skin: papules + excoriations wrists, interdigital spaces, lateral fingers, periumbilical/waistband, inner thighs, ant axillary folds. A few linear burrows between fingers. Small superficial pustules + crusting on shins/forearms c/w mild secondary infection, no significant surrounding cellulitis, non-tender. No features of crusted scabies. Chest, CVS, joints, throat all unremarkable.  

Impression:  
1) Scabies – classic distribution + nocturnal itch + multiple household contacts.  
2) Mild superficial pyoderma / secondary bacterial infection of lesions – Aboriginal background, ?higher ARF risk but adult, no systemic Sx.  
3) “General check” – not really done today, time used on rash. Needs ATSI health check.  

Plan:  
- Scabies tx:  
  • Permethrin 5% cream neck down incl between fingers/toes, under nails, groin, buttocks, leave 8–12 hrs then wash off, repeat in 7 days.  
  • Emphasised all household members to treat same time (partner, sister, 2yo). Gave printed instructions (Best Practice handout – may have duplicated in letters section).  
  • Linen/clothes/towels last few days hot wash ≥60°C or bag 8 days; vacuum etc.  

- Secondary infection:  
  • Mupirocin 2% oint TDS to crusted/pustular areas x 7 days.  
  • No oral abx at this stage – review if spreading redness, pain, fever. Low threshold for oral fluclox if worsens given background ARF risk.  

- Itch:  
  • Betamethasone valerate 0.02% cream thinly BD to itchy NON-infected areas for up to 7–10 days (avoid face/genitals).  
  • Cetirizine 10 mg PO mane PRN itch – PBS script.  

- Tests:  
  No urgent Ix – clinical Dx.  
  Planned: FBC, UEC, LFT, fasting lipids, HbA1c, STI screen etc with longer ATSI health check – not done today, time over. Will send to Sullivan Nicolaides when she books.  

- Preventive / admin:  
  Discussed need for long appt for full Aboriginal health assessment (MBS 715), immunisation review, CVD/DM risk, MH, sexual health. She agrees in principle but tangential, kept going back to cousin’s heart and neighbour’s illness. Asked reception to book long appt in 2–4 weeks (preferably not on work shift days).  

Safety net:  
  RTC 1–2 wks for rash review, sooner if fever, spreading redness/pain, feeling very unwell, SOB, chest pain, joint swelling, dark urine. If still new lesions after 4–5 wks despite proper tx, will reconsider Dx / adherence / oral ivermectin.  

Billing:  
Bulk billed today under standard consult (MBS 23). ATSI health check (715) to be done at separate long appt.  

Review:  
- 1–2 weeks: check response to scabies tx + skin sores.  
- 2–4 weeks: long appt for full health check + clarify ARF history.  

10:01 – addendum: realised didn’t document that dog not likely source – advised mites spread via close human contact, not dog.
