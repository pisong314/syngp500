Bloods stat ordered  
- UEC CMP FBC serum osmolality random BSL  
To check Na K renal fxn in context DI and ↑output  

Assessment  
1 Central diabetes insipidus established  
   Current episode polyuria + polydipsia likely 2° DI flare rather than mech urinary retention  
   Haemodynamically stable mild clinical dehydration only  
   Need to excl sig Na derangement esp hypernatraemia  
2 Pt anxiety re "urinary retention"  
   Explained retention vs DI high output situation bladder emptying well PVR nil obstruction  

Plan  
- Continue desmopressin 100 microg PO BD for now no dose change until bloods back and ideally discuss w usual endo  
- Advised drink to thirst not fixed target avoid deliberate over drinking space fluids through day avoid large bolus late evening  
- Reduce caffeine esp 4+ iced coffees may ↑diuresis and urgency  
- Reassured bladder emptying OK nil evidence retention obstruction today  

Safety net  
If Na markedly abn or if symptomatic → ED  
Discussed red flags  
  ↑confusion severe headache vomiting seizures  
  Marked dizziness unable to keep up with thirst  
  Inability to pass urine despite strong urge severe suprapubic pain  
  Signs severe dehydration ↓urine dry tongue tachycardia presyncope  
Pt asked "should I be worried about low sodium from the tablets" discussed risks high vs low Na in DI on desmopressin need bloods before any dose change  

Results & F/U  
- Will phone pt later today or tomorrow with results once available if Na sig high/low will direct to ED and send results to hospital team  
- Advised to book f/u with usual endocrinologist in next 1–2wks for broader DI review and possible dose adj offered to fax todays note + results  
- Offered longer GP f/u here for full DI hx pit surgery details long term plan needs separate booking pt agreeable  

F/U here  
- F/U phone re bloods  
- R/V in clinic PRN or sooner if worse  

Pt details & consent checked ok for phone/SMS re results
