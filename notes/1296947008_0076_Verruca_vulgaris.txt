Dx  
Verruca vulgaris  
- Subungual R thumb – partial response to 4/52 sal acid  
- Early periungual warts L index  

Plan  
- Continue salicylic acid wart paint R thumb + start same to L index  
  • Soak 5–10 mins → pare with emery board → protect normal skin → paint → occlude  
  • Continue nightly up to total 3/12 before calling failure  
- Discussed LN2 as 2nd line if poor response after full course / pt preference; risk nail damage, pain, multiple sessions  
- Pt prefers to persist with paint for now  
- Red flags explained: ↑pain, redness, swelling, pus, rapid change, pigment change, nail destruction → RTC/ED  
- Reassured benign, common, not c/w immune deficiency
