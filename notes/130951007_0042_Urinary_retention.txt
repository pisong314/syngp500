Prev results (ED discharge in My Health Record):  
– UEC: Cr 93, eGFR ~70  
– CT KUB: enlarged prostate, no stone, no mass, no hydronephrosis  
– IDC 16Fr Foley in situ

Checked practice records today:  
– COVID booster: ~18/12/23 (18/12/23? 18 months ago per summary)  
– Flu vax: NOT done this year  
– Pneumococcal: Pneumovax 23 at 65y, nil since

A:  
1. Vaccination review – 72yo, at‑risk age grp, on IDC but clinically well, no CI to vax. Due COVID booster, seasonal flu, ?pneumococcal per current ATAGI.  
2. Chronic urinary retention sec BPH with recent acute event – IDC in situ 2/52, on alpha blocker, clinically stable, no features UTI/sepsis/obstruction.  
3. Knee OA – mentioned in passing, not addressed today (time).

P:  

1) Vaccines  
– Rec COVID‑19 booster (current season) + annual influenza now.  
– Needs pneumococcal status review vs current ATAGI (likely due additional dose given >70 and >5y since last Pneumovax).  
– Nurse app’t to be bookd in next 1–2/52 for:  
   • COVID booster  
   • Flu vax  
   • Check pneumococcal schedule and admin if eligble  
– Will use clinic stock, AIR to be updated at nurse visit.  
– Advised common SEs (local pain, myalgia, mild fever), ok to use paracetamol. Red flags – high fever, SOB, chest pain, allergic rxn → ED. Pt reassured re safety with IDC, no need to delay if well.

2) Urinary retention / IDC  
– Continue tamsulosin 0.4mg mane (PBS).  
– Reinforced basic catheter care and fluids (brief).  
– No abx – asymptomatic, urine clear, systemically well.  
– Red flags: no drainage, sev suprapubic pain, rigors/high fever, new haematuria/clots, new flank pain, worsening confusion → ED.  
– Confirmed urology OPD appt in ~3/52 at local public hospital – plan likely trial of void + further BPH mgt (meds vs TURP vs ongoing cath/suprapubic).  

3) Tests / monitoring  
– UEC ordered via Sullivan Nicolaides to be done prior to next GP review if IDC still in situ (monitor renal fn).  
– Will also recheck at least once post‑urology review depending on outcome.  

4) Other  
– Knee OA to be reviewed in separate standard appt (prefer in‑person for joint exam + imaging if needed).  

Follow‑up:  
– Nurse vax app’t 1–2/52.  
– In‑person GP review ~4/52 (post‑urology) to review retention, renal fn, bowels, catheter issues, and knees if time.  
Pt verbalised understanding, “I’ll keep doing what I’m doing with the bag and come in for the jabs.” RTC earlier if worse.
