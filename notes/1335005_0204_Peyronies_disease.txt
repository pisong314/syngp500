Telehealth – phone – standard consult ~15 mins  
Bulk billed MBS 91891  

Pt: 57yo male self employed electrician  

Reason  
C/o new mid–lower back pain  
Known Peyronies disease – ongoing mgmt ED concerns  

HPI  
Back pain  
Onset ~5–6/7 gradual nil clear injury  
Site mid to lower back central to slightly R sided nil radiation to legs  
Char dull tight ache 4–5/10 baseline up to 7/10 after big work day  
Timing worse end of day on concrete and first thing am eases abit after moving  
Agg bending lifting ladders tools prolonged standing driving on rough farm track  
Relieved by lying flat heat pack Nurofen  
Pt wonders if 2° new firmer mattress also ↑ ute driving on rough driveway  
Function still working pacing himself avoiding heavy lifting nil time off yet  

Red flags by hx  
Nil trauma fall  
Nil saddle anaesthesia leg weakness numbness  
Nil bowel bladder incont or retention  
Nil fevers night sweats wt loss or unrelenting nocturnal pain  
Nil known cancer systemic illness  

Analgesia so far  
Ibuprofen 400mg bd prn x last 3/7 partial relief  
Nil other regular meds NKDA  

Peyronies / ED  
Dx ~12/12 ago re curvature + palpable plaque  
Under intermittent r/v previously no surg  
Says curvature about the same last few mths  
Mild ED sx "takes a bit more effort" nil complete ED some discomfort w intercourse  
Nil penile pain at rest nil haematuria dysuria discharge  
Has not tried specific Peyronies tx or PDE5i  
Pt has read online unsure what is reliable  
Time limited today brief discussion only offered longer appt to go through options  

PMHx  
Peyronies disease  
Otherwise nil sig chronic disease known nil DM CVD from hx  

FHx  
Non contrib from what he knows nil prostate ca nil strong back problems  

SHx  
Lives w long term partner supportive  
Self employed electrician regional area physical work bending lifting driving  
Non smoker ETOH ~6–8 std/wk mostly weekends  

Systems (targeted)  
Neuro nil limb weakness paraesthesia gait disturbance  
GU as above urinary stream normal nil freq urgency nil change in nocturia (baseline 1x)  
Constitutional nil unexplained wt loss nil fevers fatigue only re poor sleep from pain  

O/E – telehealth only  
Nil physical exam possible today  
From hx mobilising ok can heel toe walk squat climb stairs per own report  
Pattern sounds mechanical improves w movement nil red flag features elicited  
Speech coherant engaged asking appropriate questions nil distress over phone  

Ix  
Nil Ix ordered today as appears uncomplicated mechanical LBP at present  
Plan to consider imaging or physio ref if persisting >4–6/52 or if atypical features emerge  

Assessment  
1 Mechanical mid–lower back pain likely muscular or soft tissue strain 2° physical work load ± new firm mattress ± driving on rough farm road  
   Red flags screened by hx – nil concerning features at present appears safe for community mgmt w simple analgesia and activity modification  
2 Known Peyronies disease w stable curvature and emerging mild ED concerns  
   Nil acute penile red flags today brief discussion re link Peyronies and ED full mgmt deferred to longer F2F appt for exam and CV risk review prior to any PDE5i  

Plan  
# Back pain  
- Education re likely mechanical nature multifactorial work mattress driving posture etc  
- Analgesia  
  • Continue ibuprofen 400mg tds prn w food up to 5–7/7 if tolerating GI  
  • May add paracetamol 1g qid prn (max 4g/24h) as baseline  
  • Advised avoid other OTC NSAIDs concurrently  
- Activity  
  • Encourage to keep gently active avoid prolonged bed rest  
  • Simple stretches core exercises – will email practice handout (asked nurse to send via HealthLink email)  
  • Heat pack 15–20min prn  
- Safety net  
  • Urgent in person r/v or ED if new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia difficulty passing urine loss of bladder bowel control severe or rapidly ↑ pain persistent night pain not easing w simple analgesia fever or unexplained wt loss  
  • If pain not clearly improving in 1–2/52 book F2F appt for exam ± imaging ± physio ref  

# Peyronies / ED  
- Reassured that mild ED common w age and can be assoc w Peyronies  
- Very brief outline of options for ED incl PDE5i eg sildenafil but explained need for proper F2F review incl genital exam and CV risk assessment before starting  
- Asked pt to book longer appt 20–30min in next 2–4/52 specifically for Peyronies/ED discussion  
- At that visit plan  
  • Full genital exam incl plaque palpation and curvature assessment  
  • CV risk assessment (BP lipids BSL etc) prior to PDE5i  
  • Consider urology ref depending on severity + pt preference  
  • Possible baseline bloods FBC UEC LFT lipids BSL if not done recently – to be decided then  

Follow up  
- F2F standard appt 1–2/52 if back pain not significantly better earlier if worsening or red flags  
- Separate long appt 20–30min within 2–4/52 for Peyronies/ED r/v and exam  
- Pt able to repeat key red flag sx and agreed to f/u plan  

Plan discussed w supervisor Dr Chen briefly after consult  

[Supervisor addendum – Dr Chen 22/11/2025 17:10]  
Have discussed case w registrar by phone  
Agree this appears uncomplicated mechanical LBP by hx nil red flags so telehealth mgmt w NSAIDs paracetamol activity advice and clear safety net seems appropriate  
Reasonable to defer imaging at this stage provided pt understands to r/v if not improving  
For Peyronies and mild ED agree w plan for dedicated long F2F appt incl genital exam and CV risk assessment prior to any PDE5i  
Urology ref if significant curvature functional impact or pt preference  
Learning points discussed w registrar  
- Importance of thorough red flag screen in telehealth LBP  
- Need for in person exam before initiating ED meds
