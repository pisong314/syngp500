Ix  
URTI – no acute ix needed  
ETOH baseline bloods overdue → ordered today (SN/QML)  
- FBE  
- U&E, LFTs, GGT  
- Fasting lipids, fasting BSL  
Path form given – to do today if time / within 1/52  
Results pending (review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – corrected, this episode 22/11/25)  

Dx  
1) Viral URTI w rhinitis – mild, uncomplicated, no red flags  
2) ETOH use disorder / harmful use – likely physiological dependence, no acute WD  
3) Smoker – CVD risk (not addressed in detail today)  

Plan  
1) URTI  
- Reassure viral, self-limiting  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24h) – avoid combo cold/flu w extra paracetamol  
- Fluticasone NS 50 mcg: 2 sprays each nostril mane 5–7/7 then ↓ to 1 spray each nostril mane PRN  
- Saline nasal spray/irrigation PRN  
- RTC/ED if ↑SOB, CP, high fevers >48h, facial pain, purulent d/c >10/7, generally worse  

2) ETOH  
- Brief intervention only – time limited  
- Explained current intake >> NHMRC recs (≤10 std/wk, ≤4/day)  
- Discussed risks: liver, pancreas, CA, accidents, cognition, work/driving  
- Harm minimisation:  
  • Aim ≥2 alcohol-free days/wk  
  • Avoid driving after heavy nights incl next morning if unsure  
- Start thiamine 100 mg PO daily (OTC/PBS script)  
- Pt prefers gradual cut-down, not ready for abstinence/meds  
  → Goal: ↓ by ~2 beers/night on ≥4 nights/wk over next month  
- Naltrexone/acamprosate discussed briefly – pt hesitant, will reconsider once bloods back  
- Info given re local AOD svc + phone helpline (pt “might have a look”)  
- No current indication for inpatient detox (no hx WD seizures/DTs, no AM drinking, functioning at work)  

3) Smoking  
- Brief advice to quit, pt not ready – defer to future dedicated review  

F/U  
- Review 2–3/52 std appt for:  
  • Path results (LFTs etc)  
  • More detailed ETOH discussion (AUDIT-C/AUDIT, consider meds)  
  • Smoking + preventive health if time  
- Earlier review if URTI not improving 7–10/7 or any red flag (jaundice, abdo pain, confusion, melaena/haematemesis, WD sx if cutting down faster than planned)  

Pt understanding: acknowledges but minimises (“I’ll be right, just a cold and a couple of beers”) – encouraged to RTC even if unsure.
