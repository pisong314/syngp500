CC: “high BP at the chemist”  

HPC  
BP at chemist last 2–3/12 ~150–160/95. No hx HTN. No CP/SOB/neurol sx. Mild HA end of day only. Heavy ETOH, smokes, lots of coffee/energy drinks. Worried re “keeling over on site”.  

PMHx: nil sig known. No DM/CVD/stroke.  
Meds: PRN ibuprofen.  
All: NKDA  

O/E  
Gen ok, o/w NAD  
BP 158/96 R arm sitting  
HR 84 reg, afeb, RR 16, SpO2 98% RA  
BMI 29  
CVS: HS dual, no murmur, no oedema  
Resp: clear  
Abdo: soft, NT, no HSM  
Neuro grossly non-focal, GCS 15, no sig tremor  

ETOH hx (brief)  
Daily use. Wkdays ~6–8 beers/night. W/end up to 10–12 + occasional spirits. Tolerance +. Tries to cut down → “jittery, sweaty, can’t sleep” late arvo, settles after beers. No sz, no DTs. Prior low‑range DUI yrs ago. Insight fair, wants to “have a crack at cutting back” especially if helps BP.  

Smoking: ~5–10 cig/day.  

A  
1) ↑BP – likely new HTN, no red flags today  
   Multifactorial – ETOH, smoking, overweight, caffeine etc  
2) Alcohol dependence / alcohol use disorder – mod–severe  
   Dependence features +, withdrawal‑type sx but no complicated w/d hx  
3) Smoker – CVD RF  

P  
Time short today → focus BP + ETOH only  

BP / CVD  
- Explained HTN risks, contrib from ETOH/smoking/weight etc  
- Home BP: advised monitor or nurse checks → 2x readings am/pm x7/7, record, bring next appt  
- Ix ordered today (path): FBC, U&E/Cr/eGFR, LFT, fasting lipids, fasting BGL + HbA1c, CMP incl Mg, urine ACR  
- Plan: if avg BP ≥140/90 at review → start ACEi (likely perindopril) or ARB depending on renal/electrolytes. Pt prefers trial lifestyle/ETOH ↓ first but agreeable to meds if still high.  

ETOH  
- Advised pattern = dependence, ↑risk HTN, CVD, liver etc  
- Warned against sudden stop at home given w/d sx  
- Harm reduction plan:  
  • Next 2/52: aim max 4 beers/night weekdays, ≤6 any one day on w/end  
  • Discuss AFDs later once some ↓ achieved  
- Thiamine 100 mg PO TDS 1/12 then 100 mg mane ongoing while heavy ETOH  
  → Rx given today: Thiamine 100 mg tabs, 1 TDS x1/12 then 1 daily, qty 90, 2 rpt (PBS)  
- Briefly mentioned options for AOD svc / psych / groups (SMART/AA) – to expand next long appt  
- Safety: no driving after drinking, avoid work at heights/heavy machinery if intoxicated or very hungover. Red flag w/d sx (confusion, sz, severe tremor, hallucinations) → ED  

Smoking  
- Acknowledged as RF, will address in detail at f/up (NRT/varenicline/Quitline)  

RTC 2/52 long appt (booked) → review BP diary + path, decide on anti‑HTN, reassess ETOH reduction + consider AOD referral and more formal CVD risk / smoking.  
Advise earlier review/ED if CP, neuro sx, severe HA, severe w/d sx.
