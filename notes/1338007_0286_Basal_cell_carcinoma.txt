72M f/up BCC L temple  

HPC  
Here to go over bx + plan  
Very anxious “I’ve been googling those invasive basal tumours” “worried it’ll spread to my brain or bones” “Do I need a full body scan or bloods”  
Lesion L temple ~9–12/12, slow ↑, occasional crust / bleed when shaving  
Post punch bx last visit – now settled, no ↑ pain, no change per pt  
No other specific lesions today but says “I’ve got heaps of spots from years on the farm – could they all be cancer?”  
No wt loss, night sweats, neuro sx, facial weakness/numbness  

O/E (focused only – short appt)  
BP 134/78 HR 72 afeb  
L temple ~8–9mm pearly papule, rolled edge, telangiectasia, small central crust, no obvious ulcer, no surrounding induration  
Bx site healed  
No obvious other suspicious lesions face/scalp/forearms on quick look  
No palpable pre/post-auricular or cervical nodes  
CN VII grossly intact  

Ix  
Bx result reviewed today  
L temple skin punch: nodular BCC, extends to one lateral margin, no morphoeic/infiltrative features, no PNI  

A  
1. Nodular BCC L temple – bx proven, <1cm, head/neck site (↑risk area but lesion itself low–int risk)  
2. Chronic solar damage – ↑ future NMSC risk  
3. Health anxiety re cancer – ↑ worry, pushing for unnecessary tests  

P  
1) BCC L temple  
- Explained BCC = slow growing, locally invasive, mets extremely rare → excellent prognosis if fully excised  
- Not suitable for cryo/imiquimod given site/subtype  
- Discussed options: primary care excision 3–4mm margins vs derm/plastics  
- Given temple site + cosmesis + pt anxiety → rec derm for excision  
- Mohs not clearly indicated (small, nodular, no aggressive features) but asked derm to consider if lesion more extensive at time of sx  
- Pt initially wanted “cut it out today” → after discussion ok with derm referral  
- Referral sent today: non-urgent but timely to dermatologist for excision of L temple BCC, copy histology attached  

2) Staging / extra tests  
- Reassured no clinical concern for spread (small lesion, no nodes, non-aggressive histology)  
- Explained scans/bloods not indicated for uncomplicated nodular BCC and won’t change mgmt  
- Offered basic bloods if absolutely needed for anxiety but discussed “tests for the sake of it” → pt agreed to skip for now  

3) Skin Ca risk / f/up  
- Brief sun protection chat only (time limited)  
- Advised ↑ risk of further BCC/SCC now  
- Plan full skin check at separate longer appt 6–12/12 or earlier if new non-healing / bleeding / enlarging lesions  

4) Anxiety  
- Validated concerns, gave simple stats re very low mets risk + high cure rate  
- Wrote down key points + plan for him (why no scans)  
- Suggested reputable websites only (Cancer Council, DermNet)  
- If still very anxious post-op → book long appt to go over anxiety mgmt / possible brief CBT-style approach  

Safety net  
- RTC earlier if rapid ↑ size, significant pain, ulceration, new neuro sx (facial weakness, numbness)  
- ED if acute neuro deficit  

Admin / billing  
- Bulk billed today  
- Asked to book:  
  1) std f/up 3–4/52 to ensure derm appt arranged + check coping  
  2) separate long appt (20–30 min) after BCC excision for full skin check + general health check (CV risk, prostate chat etc)
