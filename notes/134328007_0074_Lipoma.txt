47F review “lump L arm” + quick diet Qs  

Hx  
Known small lipoma L upper arm (~18/12 ago)  
Now ?sl bigger last few months not sure  
No pain / no redness / no warmth / no d/c  
No trauma no ↓ROM no neuro sx  
No B sx – no fevers night sweats wt loss  

Has been googling “worried might turn nasty”  
Did not attend prev US soft tissue L arm (9/12 ago) “too busy at work”  
Missed last 2 f/up appts  

Diet: lots takeaway + soft drink skips brekkie low ex. Wants “simple tips” but low motivation  

Exam  
Obs ok: BP 126/78 HR 76 afeb sats 99% RA  
L upper arm lat prox: ~2.5–3cm soft mobile non-tender SC mass not fixed skin/muscle. Skin nl no erythema/warmth/ulcer. No regional LN. Shoulder/elbow ROM full.  

Imp  
1. L upper arm mass – c/w benign lipoma. No red flags currently. Pt anxious + poor f/up hx  
2. Overweight / poor diet – low readiness for change. No time today for full CVD/metabolic screen  

Plan  
– Reassured benign features. Discussed red flags: rapid ↑ size, pain, firm/fixed, neuro deficit, B sx → urgent review/ED  
– Re-order US soft tissue L upper arm (Qscan) to confirm lipoma + document size  
– Asked pt to book US at reception today; advised set phone reminder. Emphasised need to actually attend this time  
– Very brief diet advice only: ↓ soft drink, 1 less takeaway/wk, short walks. Dietitian offered – pt declined for now  

F/up  
– Review 4–6/52 with US result or earlier PRN change in lump  
– Plan: separate longer appt later for wt/diet + “creaky knees” if still an issue  

[No bloods ordered today – time]
