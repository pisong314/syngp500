47F here for “general check-up” + review of lump R shoulder/upper back noted last visit.

Generally well, no new specific c/o. Non-smoker, minimal EtOH. No regular meds.

Lump hx:  
- Noticed ~10–12/12 ago, slowly ↑ in size (pt: “marble to grape”).  
- No pain/itch, no skin change, no discharge, no trauma.  
- No wt loss, fevers, night sweats. No neuro sx in R arm.  
- Worried re “dangerous tumour”, asking about lipoma vs cancer and if it needs removal.

Exam (targeted):  
BP 124/78, HR 72, afeb, BMI ~26.  
R upper back/posterior shoulder: ~2.5–3 cm soft, mobile, subcut mass, non-tender, rubbery, not fixed, skin normal, no regional nodes. Full ROM shoulder, N neuro exam R arm.

Impression:  
1) Likely lipoma R upper back/shoulder – benign features, no red flags (size <5 cm, slow growth, mobile, no systemic sx).  
2) Gen health check – 47F, overweight borderline only, otherwise well, overdue routine screening.

Plan:  
- Lipoma: explained benign fatty lesion, very low malignant risk. No need for immediate removal; offered options: observe vs elective excision later if symptomatic/cosmetic or rapid growth.  
- Pt opts for watchful waiting: “If you’re not worried I’m happy to just keep an eye on it, but I’d like it removed if it keeps growing.”  
- Documented approx size today; review lump 6–12/12 or earlier if rapid ↑, pain, redness, firmness, fixation, systemic sx. RTC if worse.

- Bloods ordered today via local path (S&N): FBC, U&E, LFT, fasting lipids, fasting glucose + HbA1c, TSH. Results pending.  
  (No previous labs on file here to compare – says last “full bloods” done a few yrs ago in Sydney, no access).  

- Brief lifestyle: already walking most days, cutting down takeaway – encouraged to continue. BP fine, no dx HTN.

Screening – time limited:  
- Cervical screen: pt unsure, thinks ~4–5 yrs ago. Likely due. Needs longer appt – asked to book.  
- Breast: advised to contact BreastScreen (NSW) for mammogram – gave details.  
- Bowel: discussed will be due for iFOBT with NBCSP from 50; plan to cover more at next preventive visit (note to self).

Neck stiffness from computer briefly mentioned at end – likely postural, not assessed today, advised separate appt if persisting.

Follow-up:  
- Nurse bloods this week if not done today.  
- GP review 2–3/52 for bloods + preventive care (cervical screen, CV risk etc).  
- Lipoma review 6–12/12 or sooner if any change as above.  

Pt able to repeat back red flags, says reassured “probably just a fatty lump”.
