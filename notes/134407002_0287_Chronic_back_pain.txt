22/11/25 TH video f/up – results + back pain  

54F, known to practice (chronic back/neck pain + depn)  

CC: wants “results for my back” + ongoing back pain  

Ix results  
- L-spine XR: mild–mod degen L3–S1, ↓disc height + osteophytes, no #, no listhesis, no destructive lesion, no acute abn  
- T-spine XR: mild degen only, no acute abn  
- Bloods: FBC, U&E/Cr/eGFR, LFT, CRP/ESR all WNL  
- Vit D low–normal (borderline)  
- Lipids: mild ↑TC/LDL (non-fasting, known issue – to address separate CDM review)  

Hx  
Chronic LBP + thoracic/neck pain “for ages” fluctuating, ~6–7/10 on bad days, worse post manual handling, sitting, bending. No clear radicular sx today.  
Red flags -ve: no saddle, no bowel/bladder incontinence, no new leg weakness. Longstanding intermittent leg paraesthesia if sits too long – unchanged. Sleep intermittently disturbed.  

Meds (per summary)  
- Sertraline 50 mg mane (depn) – adherence patchy  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN (sporadic)  
No current opioids on file. Pt recalls “strong pain tabs” in past.  

Telehealth obs (limited)  
Alert, oriented, vague historian. Looks tired, mobilises in room, gait mildly stiff, no obvious focal neuro deficit on video.  

A:  
1) Chronic non-specific LBP + thoracic/neck pain – mech/degenerative, no red flags, XR c/w mild–mod spondylosis only  
2) Depn – partial control on sertraline, pain impacting mood + function  
3) Smoker, low activity – contributing to chronic pain + CV risk  
4) Dyslipidaemia mild – not main focus today  
5) Poor recall → needs simple plan + written info  

P:  
Back pain  
- Explained XR: “wear + tear”, no #/cancer/serious pathology  
- Reassured re mattress/water – unlikely cause  
- Encouraged keep active, avoid prolonged rest, pacing at work  
- Daily short walks + simple back exs – will email basic home ex sheet  
- Heat packs PRN  

Meds  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day)  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food, shortest duration, avoid if GI sx; recent U&E ok  
- No opioids – discussed not useful long term + risks  
- No further imaging (MRI etc) unless new red flag sx  

Depression / psychosocial  
- Brief mood check – “up and down”, no SI/plan when asked  
- Continue sertraline 50 mg mane; suggested phone alarm to improve adherence  
- Discussed option psych support (CBT) incl telehealth – pt tentatively open  
- Will consider Better Access referral at longer review  

Lifestyle  
- Smoking: brief chat, pt not ready to quit, will think about cutting down. Offer NRT/QUIT support later  
- Lipids/weight etc → defer to CDM review  

Safety-net  
- Advised urgent review/ED if new leg weakness, bladder/bowel change, saddle numbness, fevers, night sweats, wt loss, severe unremitting night pain  
- RTC if pain ↑ or mood deteriorates / SI  

F/up  
- Book longer F2F or TH appt 3–4/52 for:  
  - detailed pain + MH review  
  - consider CDM plan + physio + psych referrals  
  - review adherence to exs + analgesia  
- Earlier PRN if any concerns  

Will email brief summary + ex handout due to memory issues.
