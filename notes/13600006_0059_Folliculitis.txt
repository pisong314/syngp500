22/11/25  Dubbo mobile clinic – review / paperwork

29yo M sparky. Mainly here for Centrelink/housing forms, also “quick skin check”.

Last seen ~3 wks ago same clinic re: itchy pustular rash thighs/buttocks – ?bacterial folliculitis, managed with hygiene + chlorhex wash only, no abx.

Today:
- Says “those little pimply things on my legs have mostly cleared up”
- Mild intermittent itch only, no pain
- No new areas, no fevers, no feeling crook
- Using chlorhex most days, stopped sharing towels
- No oral/topical abx at all

Wants documented that rash not stopping him working, but notes hot work gear + crowded share house makes washing/linen etc harder.

PMHx: essentially nil chronic. Similar rash once 1–2 yrs ago after wetsuit, self‑resolved.  
Meds: nil regular, ibuprofen PRN. NKDA.

Obs: BP 118/74, HR 72, RR 14, T 36.7, SpO₂ 99% RA.

Skin (focussed): thighs/buttocks – mostly post‑inflammatory marks, just a few faint follicular papules, no pustules/boils, no cellulitis. No groin/genital involvement.

Dx:
1) Folliculitis – resolving, mild, likely bacterial. No indication for swab or systemic abx.  
2) Social/admin – Centrelink/housing paperwork re rental instability, work capacity.

Plan:
- Continue chlorhexidine wash daily or alt days for ~1–2 wks then PRN.
- No antibiotics started – not needed, almost resolved.
- Basic advice re loose clothing, getting out of sweaty gear, avoid towel sharing (briefly discussed only).
- Completed Centrelink/housing form:
  • noted dx folliculitis  
  • currently mild, not significantly limiting capacity to work as electrician  
  • hot conditions + limited laundry may predispose to minor recurrent skin infections but not a major disability  
  • otherwise medically fit for usual duties
- Gave short written note re hygiene points as per pt request.

RTC / see local GP if rash worsens, boils or spreading redness, or systemic sx.  
He mentioned “general check‑up sometime” – told him to book longer appt with usual GP or next outreach for full review (BP, routine bloods, skin check etc) – deferred today due to time/paperwork.
