22/11/25  Tel consult – bulk billed – post-hosp f/up

Pt rang to “go over those lung test results and the X-ray, see if my lungs are stuffed”.

72yo male, known COPD/asthma overlap, OSA on CPAP, recent RLL pneumonia with COPD exacerbation. Former heavy smoker – now says “only the odd one when the boys come over”.

Recent hosp (about 10 days ago, local regional hospital) – discharge summary in letters:
- Dx: RLL pneumonia, type 2 resp failure, COPD exacerbation
- IV abx + steroids + nebs → home on 5/7 pred, 5/7 doxy, usual inhalers
- Suggested: GP review 1/52, repeat CXR 6–8/52, pulm rehab, smoking cessation, check inhaler technique

Today by phone:
Breathlessness “about the same as when I left hospital”. Gets SOB walking lounge → kitchen, rests, then ok. Mild cough, small amount white sputum, no blood. No chest pain, no fevers/rigors, no new ankle swelling. Sleeping “so‑so”, worse if lies flat without CPAP.

Non-adherence again:
- “Ran out of the blue puffer a few weeks ago… just used the grey one when I remembered.”
- Abx: “stopped a day early ‘cause I felt alright”.
- Pred: “might’ve missed a couple”.
- Has not booked pulm rehab or resp clinic – “didn’t get around to it”.
- CPAP “maybe three nights a week”, mask uncomfortable. Wife on phone briefly – says he “forgets half his puffers unless I nag him”.

Results (in MyHR/letters):
- CXR (8 days ago): RLL consolidation improving, no effusion, hyperinflated lungs c/w COPD. Radiology rec repeat CXR 6–8/52 to ensure resolution / exclude lesion.
- Bloods on discharge: WCC 9.8 (was 15 on admission per letter), CRP 18 and falling, U&E/LFTs normal.
- Spirometry ~3/12 ago: FEV1 45% predicted, FEV1/FVC 0.54 → mod–severe COPD (no prior spirometry values given to compare).

Telehealth “exam” (limited):
Speaking full sentences on phone, no audible wheeze, answers appropriately. Denies confusion, central chest pain, blue lips/fingers, marked leg swelling. Can manage ADLs slowly at home with rests. No SpO2 available.

Meds (per pt + discharge):
- Tiotropium 18mcg daily – “forget it half the time”
- Budesonide/formoterol 400/12, 2 puffs BD – often only takes “a couple of puffs when I’m tight”
- Salbutamol 100mcg pMDI PRN – currently none at home
- CPAP nocte – poor adherence as above
No known drug allergies.

Assessment (all interlinked really):
1) COPD mod–severe – post recent exacerbation, now clinically stable by history but still quite limited exercise tolerance and very poor adherence. High risk for further exacerbations.
2) Recent RLL pneumonia – improving clinically + on CXR, but not fully resolved; needs repeat imaging given age + smoking history (?underlying lesion).
3) OSA – suboptimal CPAP use, likely contributing to fatigue and nocturnal SOB.
4) Non-adherence to meds/follow-up – major issue; pt admits “I just forget” / “couldn’t be bothered going back in”.

Plan (telehealth constraints):
- Explained CXR: pneumonia improving, COPD/emphysematous changes present. Reassured lungs “damaged but not totally stuffed”, but stressed risk if he keeps missing meds / still smoking.
- Reiterated importance of completing courses – flagged that stopping abx/pred early ↑risk relapse and rehosp.
- Scripts:
  • eRx: Salbutamol pMDI 100mcg, 1–2 puffs PRN SOB/wheeze, max 6–8 puffs/day, use with spacer.
  • No steroids/abx now – no clear current exacerbation by hx.
- Reinforced: tiotropium DAILY, budesonide/formoterol BD REGULAR even when “feels alright”. Suggested phone alarms, keeping puffers where visible; wife to help remind.
- Inhaler technique to be checked properly at next face‑to‑face (not feasible over phone).

- Safety net: advised to call 000/ED if marked ↑SOB (can’t speak in full sentences / can’t walk room to room), new chest pain, confusion, blue lips/fingers, high fevers, or needing salbutamol more than q3h or with no relief. Told to ring clinic sooner if any deterioration or new concerns.

- Investigations:
  • Ordered repeat CXR (PA + lat) for ~6 weeks from initial pneumonia (e-request to local imaging). To review result in person and consider further workup if not resolved.

- OSA: encouraged more regular CPAP use, even partial nights initially. Suggested review of mask fit with sleep clinic; he “hasn’t got around to calling them” – will revisit next appt, can re-refer if needed.

- Smoking: admits “maybe one or two smokes” socially. Strongly advised complete cessation; offered Quitline, not keen today.

- Follow-up:
  • Book face‑to‑face review in ~5–7 days: obs incl SpO2, chest exam, COPD symptom review, inhaler technique, adherence, consider COPD action plan + pulm rehab referral.
  • Separate appt in ~6–8/52 to review repeat CXR.
  • Other chronic care (vaccines, CV risk, ACP) to be done later when more time and if he attends.

Time ~12–13 mins, mostly results explanation + COPD/pneumonia review + adherence + safety net.
