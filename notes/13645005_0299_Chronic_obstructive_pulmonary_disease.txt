P  
DM  
– Continue metformin XR 1g mane + gliclazide MR 60mg mane

– Encouraged ↑walking as tolerated (flat, shorter walks)  
– Foot care reinforced  
– Order for 3–6/12 via QML/S&N next review: HbA1c, fasting lipids, UEC, urine ACR  

Complications  
– Retinal screen overdue (>18/12) → advised optometrist/diabetic eye check, note given  
– Feet done today – normal. Annual review  

Resp / COPD/asthma/OSA (brief)  
– Reassured no AECOPD features today (SpO2 95, no ↑cough/sputum, afeb)  
– Book long appt 2–3/52 for full COPD/asthma review: confirm inhalers, technique, update action plan, consider spirometry if not done <12/12, check vax (flu/pneumo/COVID), CPAP sx review  
– Safety net: RTC/ED if ↑SOB esp at rest, new/worse cough or sputum, fever, chest pain, or home SpO2 <~90 if checking  

CV  
– Continue atorvastatin 40mg nocte, perindopril 5mg mane
