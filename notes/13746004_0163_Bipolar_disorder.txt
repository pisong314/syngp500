46F known bipolar II / MDD / ?BPD / IHD  

CC: “not coping at work” + needs cert  

HPI  
3–4/52 ↓function work + home  
– ↓concentration “brain fog” ↑fatigue  
– oversleep 10–12h, non‑restorative  
– ↑appetite + ~3–4kg↑ last ~2/12  
– anhedonia, flat / numb, tearful at times  
– no clear ↑mood / ↓sleep / ↑goal‑directed / spending etc → no current hypomania  
– more sick days (3 in last 2/52 + 1 early finish) employer asking for review  

Risk  
– denies active SI / plan / intent  
– passive “what’s the point” only, says wouldn’t act  
– no thoughts to harm others  
– aware of crisis nos  

PMHx (relevant)  
– Bipolar II dx ~10y ago (hx multiple dep eps + 1 brief hypomania)  
– Personality d/o (borderline traits)  
– IHD – NSTEMI age 41 on 2° prevention. No current CP. Mild ↑SOB stairs only (needs F2F)  

Meds (self‑rep)  
– Quetiapine XR 300mg nocte – poor adherence, taking ~3–4 nights/wk (sedation / wt gain)  
– Sertraline 50mg mane – old script, taking “on and off ~½ the week” when lower (no current psych input)  
– Aspirin 100mg od  
– Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
– Metoprolol succ 47.5mg mane  
No known drug allergies  

Exam (tele)  
Speaking full sentences, no audible SOB  
Speech nl rate/vol, thoughts coherent, no overt psychosis  
Affect low, congruent. Insight fair  

Impression  
1) Bipolar II – current episode = bipolar depression, mod–severe, marked functional impairment  
   – poor adherence mood stabiliser  
   – intermittent SSRI → risk mood destabilisation  
   – baseline ↑suicide risk but today low–mod only (no plan/intent, supports in place)  
2) Personality d/o traits – likely contributing to emotional reactivity / work stress  
3) IHD – clinically stable by hx; needs routine CVD + metabolic review esp on quetiapine  
4) Work stress / ↓function – needs short sick leave + plan for graded RTW  

Plan  
Meds  
– Explained risk antidepressant monotherapy / erratic use in bipolar  
– Sertraline: advise wean then cease over ~1/52 (25mg od x5–7d if tabs allow → stop). No restart / ↑ without psych review  
– Quetiapine XR 300mg nocte: advised strict nightly use as per prev regimen, same time each night. Discussed sedation/weight issues. Pt reluctant but agrees to trial regular use ≥2/52. No dose change today  
– No new psych meds started. Avoid further antidepressants pending psych review  
– Cardiac meds unchanged (aspirin / atorva / metoprolol) – to review F2F incl lipids / BP / wt trend  

Referrals  
– eRef sent to local community MH / public psych clinic: req review for bipolar dep, med optimisation (consider alt mood stabiliser e.g. lamotrigine / lower metabolic risk agent) + support for comorbid personality d/o  
– Discussed psych (Better Access CBT/DBT‑style). Pt ambivalent, will revisit F2F  

Work  
– Medical cert issued 5 working days off for mental health / med stabilisation  
– Will consider graded RTW + task modification after review if still struggling  

Safety  
– Clear safety‑net: if ↑distress / any SI with plan / feels unsafe → 000 or nearest ED  
– Reminded of Lifeline / Beyond Blue / local MH triage (pt already has nos)  
– Encouraged to share plan with partner and seek help early  

Physical / Ix (deferred to F2F)  
– Booked F2F 1/52 for:  
   • full physical incl BP, wt, waist, CV exam  
   • bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, fasting BSL/HbA1c, TFTs, metabolic screen for quetiapine  
   • review exertional SOB, headaches, general CVD risk  
– Will check past results / trends then (lipids / HbA1c etc) and adjust statin / lifestyle as needed (PBS scripts as req)  

Follow‑up  
– F2F appt in 7/7 booked. Pt to call sooner or attend ED if deterioration  
– Will chase community psych referral outcome before / at that visit
