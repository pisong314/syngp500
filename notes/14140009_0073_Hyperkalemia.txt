Telehealth video r/v major city hub → remote community  

Pt  
72yo Aboriginal man remote community retired stockman  

Reason for consult  
- LBP flare  
- Ongoing issues re K+ CKD T2DM HHS hx  
- Multiple other concerns on pt "shopping list" not all addressed today  

HPI  

#1 LBP  
- Longstanding mech LBP chronic intermittent  
- Worsened last 5–6/7 after helping grandkids with wood "mightve twisted wrong"  
- Dull ache central low back ± into both buttocks nil clear leg rad  
- Pain ~5/10 baseline up to 7/10 with bending twisting worse evenings eased curled up  
- Nil trauma fall  
- Red flags screened → nil saddle anaesthesia nil leg weakness nil foot drop nil bladder bowel incont nil fever nil night sweats nil wt loss nil recent infection nil IVDU nil ca hx  
- Using PCM 1g bd "now and then" partial relief avoids ibuprofen as told kidneys "arent the best"  
- Mobilises short distances at home uses single point stick outdoors more stiff AM  

#2 Hyperkalaemia risk CKD  
- Known hyperK in setting T2DM CKD3 ?HHS admission ~3/12 ago tertiary hosp  
- Prev K+ peak 6.3 settled with insulin dextrose fluids ACEi held per discharge sum  
- eGFR ~45 at discharge ?CKD3  
- Current meds per MyHR + pt  
  - Metformin 500mg mane  
  - Gliclazide MR 30mg mane  
  - Ramipril 5mg mane (restarted low dose post HHS)  
  - Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
  - Aspirin 100mg mane  
  - PCM 500–1000mg prn  
- Local clinic nurse checked "sugars and salts" ~10/7 ago told "potassium abit up again" no values no ECG since last admit  
- Today feels "abit sluggish" nil palps nil CP nil presyncope nil frank muscle weakness "just old man weakness" nil SOB  
- Diet ↑ fresh fruit since admit bananas most mornings using "low salt" substitute from town likely KCl based  
- Nil NSAIDs nil herbal meds  

#3 T2DM with prior HHS  
- HHS ~3/12 ago now on simplified oral regimen as above  
- BSL checked by community nurse 2–3x/week often 14–15 sometimes 8–9 no own glucometer  
- Currently nil polyuria nil polydipsia nil confusion nil visual blurring  
- No reliable wt but clothes similar  

Other issues raised (not fully addressed today)  
- Chronic R shoulder pain "when I reach up"  
- Thickened toenails "hard to cut"  
- Intermittent itchy rash shins  
- Hearing concerns  
Explained time limits today prioritised back pain + K+/DM safety asked to book longer f/u via clinic pt mildly frustrated but agreeable  

PMHx  
- T2DM c/b prior HHS  
- ?CKD stage 3 last known eGFR ~45  
- HTN  
- Hyperlipidaemia  
- Chronic mech LBP degenerative nil spinal surg  
- Past smoker rollies quit ~10yrs ago  
- Nil known IHD CVA arrhythmia adrenal disease  

Allergies  
- NKDA  

SHx brief  
- Lives remote community with extended family grandkids assist shopping transport  
- Limited access fresh food ↑ tinned processed  
- Prefers telehealth travel to city difficult financially  

Telehealth exam (limited)  
- Gen sitting in chair at home appears stated age mildly overweight speaks full sentences nil resp distress colour ok  
- Able to stand turn slowly on request grimace with lumbar flex ext but independent  
- Gait short video with stick slightly stooped slow steady nil obvious foot drop  
- Gross neuro LL: moves both legs against gravity heel toe stand with chair support nil obvious focal weakness pt says sensation normal  
- No vitals available today from nurse  

Assessment  
1 Mechanical LBP acute on chronic likely muscular/degenerative strain on background OA type changes nil red flags on hx telehealth  
2 Recurrent hyperkalaemia risk in setting CKD3 + ACEi + ↑K+ intake (bananas daily KCl "low salt") + recent severe hyperK 2° HHS currently asymptomatic from cardiac neuro point of view but no recent bloods ECG  
3 T2DM with prior HHS suboptimal control by hx but nil current HHS features  
4 Multiple other chronic issues shoulder nails rash hearing deferred to longer appt  

Plan  

#1 LBP  
- Education re likely mech strain avoid prolonged bed rest maintain gentle activity  
- Analgesia  
  - Continue PCM up to 1g q6h prn max 4g/24h check not duplicating products  
  - Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac) given CKD hyperK risk  
- Non pharm  
  - Gentle stretches short walks as tolerated heat pack  
  - Sleep posture advice pillow under knees supine or between knees side lying consider mattress review when feasible  
- Safety net  
  - Attend local clinic / ED if new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia bladder bowel change severe night pain fever trauma fall etc  

#2 Hyperkalaemia / CKD / HTN  
- Treat as urgent but non emergency given nil sx  
- Request to remote clinic nurses today via secure email fax  
  - Bloods in next 24–48h  
    - U&E incl K+ creat eGFR  
    - HCO3  
    - FBC LFTs  
    - Fasting glucose HbA1c lipids  
  - If K+ ≥5.5 repeat urgently + ECG in clinic if available  
  - If K+ ≥6.0 or ECG changes or sx (CP palps severe weakness presyncope collapse) arrange immediate transfer to nearest hosp per protocol  
- Med changes  
  - Cease ramipril 5mg mane for now until K+ and renal fxn clarified discussed rationale prev K+ 6.3 pt agreed  
  - Avoid OTC NSAIDs potassium supplements  
- Diet  
  - Stop "low salt" substitute immediately  
  - Advise ↓ high K+ foods portion size bananas oranges big serves tomato potato certain tinned soups until dietitian / AHW input  
  - Ask clinic to arrange AHW / dietitian input re CKD + DM low K+ diet when available  
- Safety net  
  - Urgent r/v if CP palps sudden marked weakness feeling faint collapse etc attend clinic / ED not wait for telehealth  

#3 T2DM / HHS risk  
- Continue for now  
  - Metformin 500mg mane  
  - Gliclazide MR 30mg mane  
- HbA1c fasting glucose ordered as above to reassess control  
- Ask clinic nurse to continue BSL checks at least twice weekly discuss access to subsidised glucometer strips  
- Reinforced basic sick day advice fluids early help if very high sugars confusion unable to drink  

#4 Other issues deferred  
- Documented R shoulder pain toenails rash hearing concerns for next longer appt  
- Ask clinic to book 30min GP r/v (telehealth or visiting GP) to go through list MSK shoulder exam podiatry/foot care skin check hearing screen ± audiology ref  

Coordination  
- Message sent to remote clinic today with summary of plan need for urgent U&E esp K+ creat eGFR within 24–48h request in clinic BP HR wt and ECG if K+ elevated or sx  
- Ask nurses to assist with BSL monitoring diet education booking longer r/v  

F/U  
- Telehealth r/v 5–7/7 (or earlier if bloods back) to check K+ renal fxn HbA1c BP and reconsider ACEi vs alternative antihypertensive depending on results  

Pt aware to attend ED / local clinic if ↑ pain fever SOB CP confusion or any of the above red flag sx  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Brown – pathology results not yet received clinic reports pt booked for bloods tomorrow AM will check MyHR next wk]
