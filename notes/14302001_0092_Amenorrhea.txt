CC: amenorrhoea / cabergoline rpt  

HPC  
Amenorrhoea ~18/12. Hx ED + hyperprolactinaemia (pit microprolactinoma). Under RNSH endo previously  
On cabergoline 0.5mg BD weekly, ran out 1/52. Chemist said see GP for rpt  
No new H/A, no visual sx. Mildly anxious “worried my prolactin is rebounding”  
Still amenorrhoeic. LMP ~18/12 ago apart from 1 light w/d bleed on brief COCP trial (stopped – “felt crook and I don’t want to mask what my hypothalamus is doing”)  
Pt read about hypothalamic amenorrhoea, keen to “prioritise nutrition and bone health”  
No current galactorrhoea  
Vegan x3 yrs, takes B12 “most days”. Asks if veganism / micronutrients contributing and if “all the oat milk coffees and phytoestrogens are throwing my hormones off”  
Doing intermittent fasting “for productivity” – queries effect on “HPA axis”  

PMHx  
ED – restrictive pattern, underweight. No purging recently  
Pit microprolactinoma / hyperprolactinaemia  
Sec amenorrhoea  
No known thyroid/PCOS  

Meds  
Cabergoline 0.5mg twice weekly – lapsed 1/52  
Occ melatonin OTC  

All  
NKDA  

Obs/exam (brief)  
BP 108/68 HR 64 afeb SpO2 100% RA  
Wt 49.8kg, Ht 167cm → BMI ~17.8 (thin, not cachectic)  
Eyes: confront fields grossly nl  
Thyroid no goitre  
CVS/resp unremarkable  

Ix (prev)  
MRI pit ~10/12 ago – microprolactinoma, no mass effect (per RNSH letter)  
Bloods ~6/12 ago: prolactin near-nl on cabergoline (exact value not in our system), TSH nl, FSH/LH low–nl, E2 low. No DEXA on file  

A  
Sec amenorrhoea >12/12 – likely multifactorial: FHA (low energy availability, ED, low BMI) + hyperprolactinaemia from microprolactinoma → low oestrogen, bone risk  
Pit microprolactinoma – stable clinically, off cabergoline 1/52, no red flag sx  
ED (restrictive) ongoing, under- wt  
Vegan diet – ?Ca/Vit D / overall energy deficit contribution  

P  
1) Prolactinoma / hyperprolactinaemia  
– Restart cabergoline 0.5mg PO twice weekly  
  Rx: cabergoline 0.5mg tab, 1 tab twice weekly, qty 8, 5 rpt (PBS)  
– Explained cabergoline ↓prolactin only, not direct bone tx. 1/52 gap unlikely major issue  
– Red flags discussed: new/persist H/A, visual change esp bitemporal, N/V → urgent review / ED  

– Order bloods:  
  • Prolactin  
  • FSH, LH, E2  
  • TSH, FT4  
  • FBC, U&E, LFT  
  • Vit D  

Plan to fwd results + brief summary to RNSH endo (pt agreeable) and suggest review – she’s overdue  

2) Amenorrhoea / low oestrogen / bone health  
– >12/12 amenorrhoea + BMI<18 → BMD concern  
– DEXA ordered (spine/hip). Indication: prolonged sec amenorrhoea, ED, low BMI, prolactinoma  
– Clarified: bone protection mainly via adequate oestrogen + nutrition/weight-bearing, not cabergoline  
– If DEXA low or amenorrhoea persists despite wt/nutritional improvement → consider physio HRT (transdermal E2 + cyclical micronised progesterone) rather than COCP. Briefly mentioned, more detail next appt  
– Not currently sexually active, no immediate contraception needs; reminded ovulation can precede menses  

3) ED / nutrition (very brief today – time)  
– Advised intermittent fasting + high activity at work likely ↑ low energy availability → contributing to FHA. Suggested regular meals/snacks instead of fasting (to discuss properly next long appt)  
– Vegan: encouraged Ca intake (fortified plant milks, tofu etc) ± supplement to ~1000–1200mg/d. Check Vit D as above  
– Reassured oat milk / phyto-oestrogens very unlikely main driver of amenorrhoea  
– Continue psych. Will consider GPMP/TCA for dietitian/psych support next longer review (cost an issue)  

4) Safety / MH  
– Mild health/weight anxiety, perfectionistic. No SI/SH today  
– RTC earlier if mood deteriorates, ED behaviours escalate, or new neuro sx  

F/up  
– Std review 2–3/52 with bloods + DEXA (if done) → reassess prolactin, HPO status, bone plan / HRT  
– Separate long appt (20–30 min) for ED / MH / care plan – pt will book  

Pt understands: “cabergoline is for prolactin, not my bones”, agrees to restart and get tests.
