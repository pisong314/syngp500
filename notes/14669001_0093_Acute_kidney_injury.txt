Reason for visit:  
RACF reveiw – abnormla bloods (low Na, worsening renal fn) in pt on treamtent for urosepsis.  

HPI:  
74yo male in RACF, known HTN, T2DM, probable CKD. Seen in room after RN faxed path from Sullivan Nicolaides: Na 124 (was 133 four days ago), Cr 245 (baseline ~110–120), eGFR ~20 (prev ~55–60). Urosepsis dx 5 days ago by after hrs GP, now on IV ceftrixone via facillity protocol.  

Pt reports 2–3 days ↑ fatigue, “washed out”, mild nausea, more unsteady on feet. No vomitting, no diarrhoea. No CP, no SOB. ↓ urine vol, darker, over last 1–2 days. No frank confuson but “slower” per wife on phone.  

Meds (per chart):  
- Perindopril 5mg mane  
- Furosemide 20mg mane  
- Metformin 500mg bd  
- Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
- Paracetmol 1g prn (using reg past week)  
- Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily (day 2, after 3d trimethoprim/sulfamethoxzole)  

Allergies: NKDA  

Examination:  
Looks tired, in bed.  
Obs (RACF + my check): T 37.4, HR 96 reg, BP 96/58 sitting (rep 92/54, a bit light headed), RR 18, SpO2 97% RA.  
Neuro: A&O x3, mild psychomotor slowing, no focal neurology, no asterexis.  
Chest clear. HS dual, no murmur. JVP not clearly up.  
Abdo soft, NT, no CVA tendneress.  
Mild chronic ankle oedema bilat. Mucous membs slightly dry – borderline hypovolaemic vs euvol.  

Recent tests (SN path 22/11, revieiwed today):  
- Na 124  
- K 5.2  
- Cl 89  
- HCO3 21  
- Urea 25 ↑  
- Cr 245 ↑ (x2+ baseline)  
- eGFR ~20  
- Glucose 7.8 (fasting)  
- CRP 86 (down from >150 per RN record)  
- WCC 11.5 (neuts, down from 15)  
- LFTs WNL, Alb 33 (sl low)  

Urinalysis (today, MSU): SG 1.020, prot +, blood trace, nitrite +, LE + (ongoing UTI, but clincially improved, afebrile since last night).  

Impression:  
1) Hyponatraemia (Na 124, falling) – likley hypovolaemic / mixed in setting sepsis, AKI, ACEI + diurtic. Mild sx (weak, unsteady).  
2) Acute kidney injury on probable CKD3a – KDIGO stage 2–3 (Cr >2x baseline). Likley pre-renal / ATN from sepsis + meds.  
3) Urosepsis – clincially improving (afebrile, CRP/WCC down) but now c/b AKI + low Na.  
4) Hypotension – multifactorial (sepsis physio, ACEI, diuretic). Borderline haemodynamically, RACF not safe for ongoing managment.  
5) Background T2DM, HTN, hyperlip – deprioritised today.  

Plan:  
Given age, AKI, Na 124, low BP and RACF limits → needs urgent hospital assesment.  

- Cease perindopril now.  
- Cease furosemide now.  
- Cease metformin (eGFR ~20, lactic acidosis risk).  
- Avoid NSAIDs (RN informed).  
- Continue IV ceftriaxone 1g daily as charted until review in ED (dose to be checked there re renal fn).  
- Encourage small sips PO while awaiting ambuance, avoid large fluid bolus here due to Na and uncertain vol status.  

Transfer:  
- Discussed with pt and daugther (EPOA) by phone – both agree to hosp transfer for “kidneys and salts” and closer monitoring.  
- Spoke to ED reg at Royal [City] Hosp via direct line – handover given: 74yo RACF resident with urosepsis on IV ceftriaxone, new AKI (Cr 245, eGFR 20), Na 124, BP ~90s syst, borderline but stable, no confusion, no seizures. Needs IV fluids, UEC monitoring, renal assesment, possible nephrology.  
- Ambulance booked as urgent (not code 1).  
- Printed med chart + latest path + brief transfer summary sent with pt.  

Request for ED/inpatient (not done here):  
- Repeat UEC, CMP, FBC, CRP, blood cultures if any concern.  
- Serum/urine osmolality, urine Na to clarify hyponatraemia aetiology.  
- VBG/ABG if indicated.  
- Renal tract US to r/o obstruction.  
- Strict fluid balance, daily weights.  
- Slow Na correction (≤8–10 mmol/L/24h).  
- Avoid contrast, other nephrotoxins. Nephro consult if ongoing AKI. Dialyisis only if standard indications.  

Carer input:  
RN reports ↓ urine output vs baseline and “just not himself, more tired”. Wife on phone says he has been “slower on the phone” last 2 days.  

Billing:  
RACF visit – bulk billed (DVA Gold card).  

Follow up:  
Will review hosp discharge summary when avail via HealthLink and arrange RACF post-discharge reveiw 3–5 days after return. RN to call practice if deterioration while waiting amb.
