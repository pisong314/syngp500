F/U re liver problems fluid in belly post recent hosp discharge  

Pt details  
72yo Anglo-Aust male retired electrician  

HPI  
Seen ED 5/7 ago abdo distension confusion dx decomp cirrhosis tense ascites sepsis ?SBP AKI  
Discharged yday on PO abx lactulose etc with plan GP + hepatology f/u UEC LFTs 48h  

Today here "to sort out this liver and kidney thing"  
Still very bloated "like a balloon" some SOB lying flat but can talk full sentences walk short distances at home  
Oliguria "only going 2–3 times a day just a dribble" feels "they starved me of water in hospital"  
Wants diuretics back on "strong water tablets" "my usual doctor always puts me back on the water pills and I’m fine why cant you just prescribe what I’m asking for"  
Believes kidneys crook from lack of water + "cheap home‑brand cordial"  

Requests USS today "I need an ultrasound today I cant wait weeks"  
Asks re dialysis "If the kidneys are dodgy why arent you giving me dialysis right now"  

Current sx  
Abdo distension unchanged mild diffuse tenderness nil focal peritonism  
Nil fever rigors vomiting haematemesis melaena confusion today  
Mild nausea ↓appetite feels weak  
Nil CP nil new periph oedema baseline mild ankle swelling  
Nil frank haematuria nil dysuria

Ok with public hosp follow up overall

Impression  
1 Decompensated cirrhosis w sig ascites ongoing  
2 AKI in cirrhosis recent sepsis hypotension oliguria high concern evolving HRS-AKI vs persisting sepsis-related AKI haemodynamically borderline unsafe for community only mgmt  
3 Recent sepsis ?SBP on PO step-down abx abx choice + dose ?suboptimal for severe renal imp  
4 HTN hx now hypotensive ACEi diuretics appropriately withheld  
5 Pt w high health demand requesting specific tx USS dialysis challenging advice needs clear limits  

Plan  

#1 Disposition  
Explained to pt combo of severe recent AKI (Cr 320) cirrhosis tense ascites low BP oliguria → high risk further renal failure need for dialysis death  
Advised immediate transfer back to same public ED for  
- Repeat bloods UEC LFT FBC CRP coag  
- Blood cultures if febrile  
- Assess ongoing sepsis vs HRS-AKI  
- IV access vol status careful fluids ± IV albumin  
- Nephrology hepatology r/v consider terlipressin + albumin if HRS  
- Consider therapeutic paracentesis if tense ascites causing sx with albumin cover  
- Review abx incl cefalexin dosing for eGFR 15 and change as needed  

Pt initially resistant "why cant you just give me some water tablets and send me for a scan"  
Discussed that diuretics now likely to ↓renal perfusion worsen AKI that GP cannot provide IV albumin monitoring dialysis  
After risks incl poss death permanent dialysis emphasised pt reluctantly agreed to hosp r/v still unhappy about "wasting time in ED"  

Ambulance organised for transfer given hypotension frailty high risk  
Detailed letter sent electronically + printed w pt  

#2 Meds today  
Nil restart diuretics  
Nil restart ACEi  
Continue current meds until hosp team r/v but flagged in letter that cefalexin dose needs renal adj  
Reinforced avoid NSAIDs OTC nephrotoxins  

#3 Ix  
No new bloods here given urgent need for hosp level care and quicker turnaround  
In ED letter requested urgent UEC LFT FBC CRP/ESR INR blood cultures urinalysis renal/abdo imaging as indicated baseline Cr 95 6/12 ago documented  

#4 Education / safety net  
Brief explanation re kidney injury in cirrhosis can worsen quickly often needs hosp-only tx albumin terlipressin dialysis etc  
Explained why diuretics ACEi held during AKI  
Red flags discussed incl ↓urine confusion drowsiness ↑SOB vomiting blood black stools fevers rigors severe abdo pain  
Wife present supportive of plan  

#5 Behaviour / engagement  
Pt repeating "why cant you just prescribe what Im asking for" verbal only nil aggression  
Ultimately accepted hosp plan  

#6 Logistics / admin  
Ambulance booked  
Practice nurse helped organise transfer ensured pt had med list and discharge summary copy  
Bulk billed today  

Follow up  
GP r/v 3–5/7 after re-discharge or earlier if contacted by hosp for ongoing cirrhosis AKI mgmt med reconciliation esp diuretics/ACEi decisions  
Plan to address EtOH hx vaccination status ACP once more stable  
Pt requested ref to "top liver specialist in the private system" to discuss next visit longer appt suggested  

RTC/ED if any deterioration as above or if unable to access planned ED care today
