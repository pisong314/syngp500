Exam (phone)  
Sounds well, full sentences, no audible SOB, coherent  

Impression  
1) Fatigue / gen weakness – subacute, likely multifactorial (↓activity, diet, hydration, chronic constipn, depn). No red flag sx on hx. Need screen for anaemia/thyroid/metabolic/B12/D.  
2) Chronic functional constipn – no alarm features, likely lifestyle + SSRI contributing.  
3) Depn – stable on SSRI, needs dedicated review but not today.  

Plan  
Fatigue / Ix  
→ e-req to onsite path (S&N)  
   - FBC, U&E, LFT  
   - TSH  
   - Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
   - Lipids  
   - Iron studies, B12, folate  
   - Vit D  
Fasting bloods next 1–2/52 → review results via TH / f2f  

Constipation  
→ ↑fibre, ↑H2O, ↓coffee (briefly discussed)  
→ Start psyllium husk daily (↑ to BD if needed, with fluids)  
→ If no better 1–2/52 add macrogol (Movicol/OsmoLax) 1 sachet mane, titrate  
Avoid regular senna – keep PRN only if above fails  
Red flags discussed briefly – PR bleed, wt loss, severe abdo pain, complete obstn → ED  

Depn  
No acute risk today  
Book long f2f 3–4/52 for MH review + other issues (shoulder/toe/HA)  

F/U  
- Path collection 1–2/52  
- Results appt 1–2/52 after bloods  
- Long appt 3–4/52 (≥20 min)  
RTC sooner / ED if acute SOB, CP, neuro sx, severe abdo pain, mood deterioration/SI
