CC: “lump on my eyelid, right on the edge of it”

Hx:  
R upper lid lump x “week or two… maybe longer, I can’t quite remember”  
Feels like “a little pea”, more annoying/heavy than painful  
Not really sore, just “in the way” when reading/watching telly  
Hx chronic blepharitis, says eyes “often a bit crusty in the mornings”  
Thinks maybe from “that old pillow” / “too much telly”  
Similar thing yrs ago → settled w “hot flannels” ± “that antibiotic cream” (pt unsure)  

Red flags (tel hx only):  
-vision ok, no diplopia  
-no sig eye pain, no painful EOM  
-no photophobia  
-no ↑ discharge (just usual AM crusting)  
-no fever, no feeling systemically crook  
-no diffuse lid erythema, just “a bump”  
Can open/close eye fully per pt  
Lump feels firm not rock hard, not very tender when she presses  

Meds: unclear over phone (“little white pill… or is it blue… for my pressure”) – to confirm at next HV. Past notes: no AC.  
All: NKDA in record, pt says “not that I know of”  
PMHx (from file): HTN, HLD, OA knees, chronic blepharitis. No DM on record.  

O/E: tel only – no visual exam  
From description: focal R upper lid margin lesion, non-tender, no diffuse swelling, no discharge, no spread to cheek/forehead, no systemic sx  

Impr:  
1) R upper lid chalazion likely – focal, non-tender, chronic, no infective features  
2) Chronic blepharitis – likely contributing (meibomian blockage)  
3) Poor historian – onset/treatment timeline unreliable  

DDx less likely:  
-hordeolum/stye (would expect acute tender, more infective)  
-preseptal/orbital cellulitis (no pain, no spreading erythema, no systemic/visual sx)  

Plan:  
-Explain benign gland blockage, likely chalazion  
-Warm compresses R eye: hot (not scalding) face washer 5–10 min, 3–4x/day → then gentle lid massage towards margin if not painful  
-No topical abx, no PO abx – no evidence infection/cellulitis  
-Brief blepharitis reminder: daily warm compress + lid clean (dil baby shampoo / commercial wipes if daughter can get)  
-Ask pt to get daughter to bring ALL eye drops/wipes/ointments + pill bottles to next HV for med rec + eye review  

Safety net (repeated several times – poor recall):  
-RTC/OOH/ED if rapid ↑ redness/swelling eyelid/face  
-if eye becomes painful, hard to open, vision ↓ or double  
-if fever, feels very crook, or pain with eye movements  
-if lump persists >4–6/52 or enlarges despite regular compresses  

F/up:  
-Review at next scheduled GP home visit ~2/52 – visual exam eyelid, confirm meds, optimise blepharitis care  
-If still present 4–6/52 or cosmetically/symptomatically troubling → non-urgent ophthal refn for I&C  

Other:  
-pt mentioned “my knees have been worse again” – defer to next HV (time)
