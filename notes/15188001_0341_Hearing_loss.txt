Plan  
# URTI  
Likely viral discussed natural course 7–10/7  
Cont paracetamol PRN max 4g/24h  
Trial saline nasal spray PRN  
Short course intranasal decongestant (OTC) if needed max 3–5/7 to avoid rebound  
Abx not indicated pt agrees  

Safety net  
Advised R/V or ED if fever >38.5 for >48h ↑SOB pleuritic chest pain confusion severe headache neck stiffness facial pain or if generally deteriorating  

# Hearing loss  
Reassured some temporary ↓ common with URTI Eustachian tube dysfunction  
Audiology r/v as above prefer same local provider as last time  
Encouraged regular HA use once URTI settled check fit placement  
Basic comm strategies discussed TV off when talking ask others to face her speak clearly reduce background noise  
ENT ref not required currently nil unilateral sx nil red flags will reconsider post audiology if asymmetry or rapid decline  

# Anxiety  
Validated worries brief supportive counselling  
Encouraged ongoing breathing relaxation techniques  
Offered longer appt for MHCP / psych referral pt keen but not today  
Plan book long appt 2–4/52 to address anx coping screen eg GAD7  

Follow up  
GP r/v ~2/52 or earlier PRN to check URTI resolution and review audiology if done  
RTC earlier if hearing acutely worse esp unilateral or assoc vertigo tinnitus neuro sx  

Other  
Pt quite tangential long stories re neighbour’s cold daughter in Perth etc required redirection  
Several minor issues raised eg “water tasting different at home” deferred advised to book separate appt if ongoing
