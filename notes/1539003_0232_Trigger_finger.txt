58F Yolŋu AHW. Bulk billed.  

CC: R ring finger catching / results review  

HPC:  
4–5/12 hx R ring finger pain + “locking” esp am. Stiff 10–15 mins then eases. Pain to 7/10 but says “only a bit sore”. Worse long days paperwork / phone / lifting grandkids. Needs L hand to straighten sometimes. +click/+“pop”. No trauma. No numb/tingle, no weakness, no fevers, no spreading redness.  

No DM, no thyroid, no known arthritis/gout. Nil regular meds. Using panadol 1g bd prn, bush meds. Nonsmoker.  

Ix (review):  
R hand XR: no #, no disloc. Mild IP OA only, no erosions.  
Bloods: FBC/CRP/ESR N, U&E/LFT N, urate N, TSH N, HbA1c 5.6% (no DM), RF/anti‑CCP -ve.  

Exam (focused R hand):  
VSS.  
R ring finger: mild volar fullness @ MCP/A1 pulley. Palpable tender nodule. No erythema/warmth.  
ROM: partial fist only, triggering from flex→ext, needs assist 2/3 attempts. Passive ROM full, mildly tender. +palpable/audible click. NVI intact, grip ↓ a bit due pain. No CTS signs. Other small joints hands/wrists elbows NAD.  

Dx:  
1) Trigger finger R ring finger (stenosing tenosynovitis)  
   – classic hx + exam, >3/12, no red flags, Ix reassuring (no inflam arthropathy / gout / sepsis)  
   – RFs: F, >50, high repetitive hand use (work + home).  
2) High occupational/caring load → harder to rest hand.  

Plan:  
– Explained dx briefly, reassured re bloods/XR (no “rheumatism”, no cancer).  
– Activity mod: ↓repetitive gripping / forceful grasp R hand, ↑L hand use where safe. Offered work letter – pt will wait.  
– Splint: fitted simple finger splint in rooms to limit MCP flex esp o/n + when off work.  
– Analgesia: continue paracetamol up to 1g QID prn (max 4g/d). No NSAID started. No new scripts needed (OTC).  
– Refer hand therapist (OT/physio) → tendon gliding ex, splint optimisation, workplace ergonomics. Internal referral sent, ask to align appt with roster.  

– Discussed steroid inj @ A1 pulley as next step if no better 4–6/52 (good success rates). Risks explained briefly. Pt prefers to defer: “see if this settles first”.  
– Surgery only if fails conservative + inj – not indicated now.  

Safety net: RTC/ED if finger stuck and can’t straighten, ↑swelling/redness into hand, severe pain, fever, sudden ↓movement/sensation.  

F/up: GP review 4–6/52 to assess response, reconsider steroid inj. Longer appt another day for tiredness + knee pain/CVD risk etc (not done today, time).
