Ix  
Baseline midlife screen ordered SN/QML  
FBC UEC CMP lipids fasting BSL or HbA1c TSH  
Explained menopause dx clinical hormone tests not needed declined “full hormone and cancer tests” after discussion re limited utility  

(Prev labs not on file old practice records not yet scanned)  

Dx / Impression  
1 Sleep disturbance multifactorial  
   - Likely 2° menopausal vasomotor sx + health anxiety + poor sleep hygiene  
   - Nil red flags OSA other sleep disorder today  

2 Menopause postmenopausal 14/12 amenorrhoea  
   - Mod–severe vasomotor sx  
   - GSM (vaginal dryness dyspareunia nocturia ?contrib to recurrent UTIs)  
   - Nil clear C/I to MHT  

3 Health anxiety / anxiety disorder  
   - Exacerbated by menopause + chronic poor sleep fxn intact but distress high reassurance seeking  

4 Recurrent uncomplicated UTIs currently asymptomatic  
   - Likely related to GSM  

Plan  
1 Sleep / vasomotor sx  
   Discussed typical menopausal course reassured nil features to suggest malignancy dementia etc today  
   Options covered template: lifestyle sleep hygiene CBTi non hormonal (SSRI/SNRI etc) vs systemic MHT most effective for flushes  
   Pt very anxious re breast ca risk from HRT discussed abs vs relative risk contemporary data window of opportunity <10yrs from menopause overall benefit>risk in healthy 50s non smoker BMI ~26  
   Agreed trial combined MHT transdermal + oral  
   - Estradiol patch 50 microg twice weekly  
   - Micronised progesterone 100mg nocte continuous regimen  
   Counselled expected onset 2–4/52 poss SE breast tenderness irregular spotting mood change rare VTE etc advised seek urgent care if chest pain SOB unilateral leg swelling severe headache heavy PMB  

   Sleep hygiene advice given standard template  
   - Fix wake time wind down routine  
   - Avoid screens in bed minimise phone o/n  
   - Limit alcohol avoid using wine as sleep aid  
   - Caffeine AM only (already mostly)  
   - If awake >20–30min get out of bed quiet activity back when sleepy  

   Suggested CBT based resources eg This Way Up Beyond Blue written info given  

2 Menopause / GSM / UTIs  
   Explained GSM incl vaginal + urinary sx low dose vaginal oestrogen minimal systemic abs safe even w her breast ca fears  
   Start estriol 0.5mg PV cream nightly x 2/52 then BD weekly maintenance  
   Expect improvement dryness intercourse discomfort poss ↓UTI recurrence and nocturia over time  
   Nil current UTI sx so nil abx today  
   General UTI prevent advice briefly post coital void hydration avoid spermicides  

3 Anxiety / health anx  
   Normalised some worry gently challenged catastrophic beliefs re sleep cancer dementia  
   Offered r/v psych for CBT health anx + insomnia pt keen “but wants to see how hormones go first”  
   Plan longer appt for MHCP when time  
   No SSRI/SNRI today consider if persisting anx or MHT not suficient  

4 Preventive / monitoring  
   Path as above SN/QML results via HealthLink will r/v  
   Will need future appt for broader menopause health check CVD risk bone health DEXA ? given maternal hip # cancer screening up to date etc (not covered today)  

Safety net  
Advised seek urgent r/v or ED if chest pain SOB unilateral leg swelling sudden severe headache neuro deficit heavy or persistent postmenopausal bleed fever >38.5 or feeling very unwell  
RTC if new urinary sx or mood worsens or SE on MHT  
Encouraged not to book frequent “just in case” visits for minor transient sx instead keep brief sx diary next 4–6/52  

F/U  
Book long consult 4–6/52  
- R/V response to MHT sleep + flushes SE  
- R/V vaginal oestrogen GSM UTI freq  
- Discuss bloods  
- Complete MHCP consider psych ref ± SSRI  
Earlier appt PRN if deterioration  

Time  
Std 15min consult multiple other non urgent concerns (wt gain dementia risk request “all my hormones”) noted but deferred to future long appt by mutual agreement
