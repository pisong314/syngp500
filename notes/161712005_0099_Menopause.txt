54F – sleep probs / ?meno  

CC: “not sleeping at all lately – need something stronger”  

HPC  
6–8/12 hx waking 2–3am most nights → hard back to sleep, unrefreshed, daytime fatigue/irritable  
+ hot flushes + night sweats (“wake up drenched then freezing”) multiple/day & overnight  
Mood labile, ↑stress at work, caring for mum weekends  
No snoring/apnoeas, no RLS  
No wt loss, no red flag neuro  

Menses: irreg last 2 yrs, now amenorrhoea ~13/12 → postmeno. Mild vag dryness, no PV bleed  

PMHx  
IHD – NSTEMI 4 yrs ago  
HTN, hyperlipidaemia  
Ex-smoker, ETOH most nights (↑recently “to nod off”)  

Meds (per file, adherent)  
Aspirin 100 od  
Atorvastatin 40 nocte  
Bisoprolol 5 mane  
Perindopril 5 mane  
No ADs/sedatives. NKDA  

O/E  
BP 128/76 HR 68 reg afeb SpO₂ 99% RA  
Gen tired but well, no distress  
CVS/resp abdo NAD  
Neuro grossly non-focal  
MSE: irritable but appropriate, no psychosis, no SI  

Impression  
1) Sleep disturbance – likely maintenance insomnia 2° vasomotor meno + stress. No maj depn, no OSA features today  
2) Menopause – postmeno w vasomotor sx + mild GSM  
3) IHD stable – impacts MHT risk/benefit  
4) Overweight (BMI 27)  
5) ↑ETOH as self-med for sleep  

Plan  
– Discussed meno → hot flushes/night sweats contributing to sleep. Wants “strong sleeping tabs” + “hormone patches today”  
– Declined benzo / z‑drug Rx (dep, falls, cog, poor LT benefit explained). Pt not happy but accepts trial alt  
– MHT: explained most effective for vasomotor but ↑risk in context IHD → need full CVD review & use transdermal oestradiol + prog if proceed. No patches today.  

Non-hormonal option today  
– Start escitalopram 5 mg mane 1/52 then ↑10 mg mane if tol (for vasomotor + mood/anx → may help sleep)  
– SEs discussed briefly (GI, HA, sexual, initial sleep change)  

Sleep / lifestyle (brief – time)  
– Adv ↓caffeine (none after lunch)  
– Adv ↓ETOH esp as sleep aid  
– Basic sleep hygiene + manage temp at night (cool room, layers) – handout given  

Ix – SNP path forms given  
– FBC  
– U&E, LFT  
– TSH  
– Fasting lipids + glucose / ±HbA1c as per lab  
– Vit D (postmeno + FHx #)  
No FSH/E2 – explained not needed at this age w clear hx  

CVD  
– Clinically stable today. Cont aspirin/statin/BB/ACEi  
– Will review lipids, U&E once results back  
– Encourage cont walking, ↑as fatigue improves  

Safety  
– Red flags: chest pain, SOB, focal neuro, unilateral leg swelling, postmeno PV bleed → ED/urgent review  
– RTC if mood worsens or SI  

F/up  
– Review 2–3/52 (booked, 30min early AM)  
  • Check sleep, vasomotor sx, escitalopram tol/dose  
  • Review bloods  
  • Detailed MHT vs non-hormonal discussion  
  • CVD risk optimisation + consider DEXA (postmeno + maternal hip #)  

Pt still focussed on “quick fix” but agrees to trial plan for now.
