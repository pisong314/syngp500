Plan  

STI mgmt  
– Discussed eTG: doxy 1st line for chlamydia in non‑preg, ceftriaxone IM for gonorrhoea  
– Rx:  
  • Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd 7/7 (script given)  
  • Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM stat in 2 mL 1% lignocaine – given today by PN  
– Adv: abstain sex incl oral/anal/vaginal x7/7 after both pt + partners completed tx; condoms ongoing  
– Partner notification last 6/12 esp last 2/52 – discussed can use anonymous online tools  

Ix – SNP/QML today  
– Urine FP NAAT chlamydia/gonorrhoea  
– Self‑collected vaginal swab NAAT CT/NG (± others per lab panel)  
– Serology: HIV, syphilis, Hep B (HBsAg, anti‑HBs, anti‑HBc), Hep C Ab  
– Urine β‑hCG offered pt declined (LMP normal + no sx) informed refusal documented  

Vax  
– Discussed ATSI adult recs – HPV catch‑up ≤25y, flu annually, COVID booster, Hep B, dTpa 10‑yearly etc  
– Unsure HPV hx → HPV9 0.5 mL IM today (extra dose safe)  
– Flu + COVID booster rec but deferred (time / concern re multiple jabs)  
– Hep B: await serology then plan course/booster  
– dTpa likely due – to review next visit  

Safety net  
RTC if ↑ pelvic/abdo pain, fever, heavy PV bleed, offensive discharge, eye sx or if doxy SE problematic.  

F/U  
Review 1–2/52 for results (HIV/syph/viral hep/NAAT) + vax plan (flu, COVID, dTpa, ± Hep B series) + check partner notification.  
No routine TOC planned unless sx persist/recurrence or re‑exposure (note re rectal infection / azithro regimens for future).  

Time  
Std appt slightly over – deferred contraception + broader preventive care to longer f/up appt.
