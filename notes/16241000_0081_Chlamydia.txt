- Throat NAAT CT/NG  
- Rectal NAAT CT/NG (self-collect with nurse)

A  
1) Subacute dry cough – likely viral URTI resolving / irritant (smoke, cigs). Chest clear, obs ok, low concern PNA/TB/asthma.  
2) CT – recent +ve, poor adherence, high-risk behaviour → retreatment req.  
3) NG – recent pharyngeal, ?incomplete tx → retreat as persistent infection.  
4) HIV – new dx, on ART via tertiary svc, clinically well today.  
5) Syphilis – on tx via sexual health; need coord.  
6) Engagement/adherence issues – poor historian, chaotic work, ↑risk non-adherence/LTFU.  

P  
Cough  
- Reassured, likely viral/irritant.  
- Symptomatic only:  
  - Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (max 4 g/d)  
  - Simple linctus / honey PRN  
- Smoking brief intervention – not ready to quit, will "cut down" → revisit later.  
- Safety-net: RTC/ED if SOB, CP, fever, haemoptysis, worse; review if >3–4/52 → consider CXR/spiro.  

CT retreatment  
- Given adherence concerns, opted azithro regimen:  
  - Azithromycin 1 g PO stat in clinic (DOT)  
  - + Azithromycin 1 g PO to take at home 12–24h later (labelled pack, written + verbal instr)  
- No sex x7/7 after starting tx + until any sx resolved. Strong condom advice ongoing.  
- TOC NAAT ≥4/52 post-tx (esp rectal). Book GP review 4–6/52.  

NG retreatment  
- Treat as persistent:  
  - Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM stat with 1 mL 1% lignocaine (R gluteal, nurse)  
  - Azithro as above covers dual tx per local protocol  
- No sex as above.  
- TOC throat/rectal NAAT at 2/52 → book nurse/GP appt.  

Contact tracing  
- Discussed partners last 6/12 need STI screen (HIV, syph, CT, NG).  
- Gave info for anonymous SMS notification services.  
- Pt will contact "on/off girlfriend" + 1 male partner.  

HIV/syph coord  
- With pt consent will msg/fax HIV/sexual health clinic re:  
  - Today’s CT/NG retreatment  
  - Req confirm: current ART, adherence support, latest VL/CD4, syph plan + RPR schedule  
- Encouraged to attend upcoming HIV appt (pt to check SMS/letter).  
- Next visit here to cover vax (Hep A/B, HPV etc), smoking, broader preventive care.  

Adherence support  
- Simple written plan: time for 2nd azithro dose, no sex x7/7, f/up dates, red flags.  
- Teach-back – pt able to repeat basics, needed exact time written ("take 2nd dose tonight 9 pm").  
- Nurse phone call 2–3/7 to check 2nd dose taken, SEs, reinforce abstinence + f/up.  

F/up  
- Nurse call 2–3/7  
- GP 2/52: cough review ± CXR, TOC NG throat/rectal  
- GP 4–6/52: CT TOC, HIV/syph/prev care review  

Billing: likely Level B, bulk billed (time slightly >15 mins but complex → left as B today due to clinic running late)
