58M known HFE haemochromatosis (C282Y homozygote) on maint venesection via public haematology q3–4/12  

CC: wants bloods + abd US results  

S: “bit tired, prob just work/age” still FT accountant long hrs. Mild LUQ discomfort under L ribs x months, worse w twisting / big meals, stable. No sig abdo pain, no N/V, no ∆bowels, no PR bleed/melaena. No jaundice, pruritus, wt stable. No fevers/night sweats/infxn. No easy bleeding, only minor bruises w trauma. Mild DOE on stairs, longstanding. Tends to minimise sx “don’t want to be a bother”  

O (phone): sounds well, speaking full sentences, no audible SOB, cognitively intact  

Ix reviewed (SN path 1 wk ago):  
FBC: Hb 140, WCC 5.2, Plt 145 (low–N, stable cf 150–160 last yr)  
Iron: Ferritin 120 (on target maint, prev ~100–150), TSat 42%  
LFTs: ALT 42 (sl ↑, was 38 last check), AST 35 N, ALP 110 N, GGT 55 (sl ↑, similar prior), Bili 12 N  
FBG 5.6  

Abdo US (1 wk ago, cf 12/12 ago):  
Liver: ↑echogenicity c/w fatty change/chronic liver dz, no focal lesions, portal vein patent  
Spleen: 15.5 cm (was 14.8) homogenous no focal lesions  
No ascites, GB/biliary normal  

A:  
1) Splenomegaly – mild ↑ size 14.8 → 15.5 cm over 12/12, likely 2° portal HTN / chronic liver disease in context HH. Plt low–N only, no red flags currently  
2) HFE haemochromatosis – on appropriate maint venesection, iron indices OK. Ongoing risk fibrosis/cirrhosis/HCC  
3) LUQ discomfort – likely from enlarged spleen, mild, stable, pt under-reports  
4) Possible chronic liver disease (HH ± metabolic/fatty liver) – mild LFT abn + US fatty change, needs fibrosis staging  

P:  
- Continue current venesection schedule via haematology  
- Order FibroScan (transient elastography) – local liver clinic / Qld Liver → assess fibrosis  
- Bloods in 3/12: FBC, LFT, ferritin, iron studies (SN path)  
- Hep B sAg, Hep C Ab if not on file (check Best Practice, if not documented → order w next bloods)  
- If FibroScan shows advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis → refer hepatology / liver clinic for ongoing mgmt + HCC surveillance (US + AFP 6/12)  
- Adv: avoid iron supps, keep ETOH low (≤1–2 std when drinks, some AF days). Brief chat re wt/diet/exercise, NAFLD risk  
- Red flags discussed: sudden severe LUQ pain / shoulder tip pain, abdo distension, haematemesis/melaena, jaundice, confusion, easy bleeding → ED/urgent review  
- Encouraged to call earlier if sx ↑ despite “not wanting to be a bother”  

F/U:  
- Face to face 4–6/52 (20 min) or earlier if FibroScan done → review FibroScan + repeat bloods, abdo exam (spleen, portal HTN signs), discuss HCC surveillance + poss hepatology referral. Also screen DM / arthropathy if time  
- RTC sooner if sx worsen  

Time: ~12 min tel consult. Bulk billed (MBS 91809)
