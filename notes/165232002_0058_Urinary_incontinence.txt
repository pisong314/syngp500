Ix ordered today (path form given – onsite collection)

- U&E, CMP  
- TSH  
- CRP/ESR  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c  

Impression  
1. Fatigue/weakness subacute 3–4/52 – no red flags today. ?anaemia ?thyroid ?renal/electrolytes ?inflamm (IBD) ?deconditioning  
2. Urge-predom urinary incont, chronic, stable sx, signif QoL impact, pt med-averse  
3. Constipation / hx faecal impaction in IBS/UC – contrib to bladder sx, currently no impaction features  
4. UC/IBS – clinically quiescent  
5. HTN/HLD – stable on current Rx (brief review only)  

Plan  
1) Fatigue  
- Proceed with above bloods  
- No med changes pending results  
- RTC/ED if CP, SOB at rest, sudden ↓power, PR bleed/melaena, fevers, confusion  

2) Urge incont  
- Conservative focus (pt again declined oxybutynin trial today – worried re SEs, esp constipation/cognition)  
- Advised ↓tea/caffeine, ↑water, avoid large eve fluids  
- Bladder training discussed briefly  
- Pelvic floor physio re-offered; pt “will think about it” – no referral sent yet  

3) Bowels / constipation  
- Encouraged more REGULAR macrogol (small daily / alt days) to prevent re-impaction – pt agreed to trial low regular dose  
- Monitor for ↑abdo pain, ↓BO, overflow soiling, PR blood  

4) Chronic disease  
- Cont amlodipine 5mg, atorvastatin 20mg – no change today  
- Full CDM / HTN/HLD review next visit (long appt) – pt prefers “one thing at a time”  

F/up  
- Review 1–2/52 for results + recheck fatigue/incont/bowels (book long if poss)  
- Earlier if worse as above
