57M tiler – review + forms  

CC: R knee swelling “bloody knee keeps blowing up” + Centrelink/housing forms. DM overdue review.  

HPI  
R prepatellar swelling ~3–4/12, worse 4–6/52. On knees all day, knee pads intermittent (“forget them in the ute”).  
Pain 4–5/10 rest, 7/10 kneeling/deep flex. Worse end of workday. ↓ w/e.  
No fevers/rigors, no systemic sx. No known skin break. Says a bit red last wk after big day.  
OTC ibuprofen “now and then”. Ice occasionally. Can do stairs but slow/painful on bad days. Worried re future work capacity.  

DM2 – last review ~9/12 ago. Multiple DNAs.  
On EMR: metformin XR 1g bd, gliclazide MR 60mg mane. Admits poor adherence, ran out “a few weeks ago”. No home BGLs. Denies osmotic sx. Diet poor. Missed previous bloods.  

SH (brief): casual tiler, variable income. Applying public housing.  

O/E  
BP 138/82 HR 82 afeb. BMI ~30.  
R knee – localised prepatellar swelling, skin intact, -erythema, -warmth cf L. Mild tender over bursa only. No joint effusion. ROM: flex limited ~100° by discomfort, full ext. Lig stable, McMurray -. WB ok, mild antalgic on first steps. No peripheral oedema. Feet quick look: skin intact, mild callus, DP +.  

Ix ordered today  
- FBE, U&E, CRP, ESR (r/o septic/inflammatory bursitis esp DM)  
- HbA1c, FLP, LFTs, urine ACR (DM review)  

Dx  
1) R prepatellar bursitis – chronic, non-septic, occupational (repetitive kneeling).  
2) T2DM – likely poorly controlled, non-adherent, no recent monitoring.  
3) Work/functional limitation – kneeling, squatting, stairs on flare days.  

Plan  
R knee  
- Non-septic clinically → no aspiration today.  
- Rest/↓kneeling as able, emphasised proper knee pads (suggest spare pair at job site).  
- Ice post-work. Light compression sleeve if tolerated.  
- Analgesia: paracetamol up to 1g qid prn.  
- NSAID trial: ibuprofen 400mg tds with food up to 5–7/7 if no GI/renal issues.  
- Discussed possible bursal aspiration + steroid inj if persists once infection excluded – pt prefers watch and wait.  
- Red flag advice: RTC/ED if red, hot, rapid ↑ swelling, fever, unable WB.  

DM  
- Re-start meds:  
  • Metformin XR 1g bd with food (PBS)  
  • Gliclazide MR 60mg mane (PBS)  
- Discussed adherence strategies (pillbox, link to meals).  
- Pathology done on-site today to minimise DNA.  
- Plan longer DM review 1/52 – feet, BP, renal, retinal check, consider GPMP/TCA, nurse support/SMS reminders.  

Forms/admin  
- Centrelink/housing forms completed today: documented dx chronic R prepatellar bursitis + T2DM.  
- Noted: pain with kneeling/squatting/prolonged standing/stairs when flared. Still able to work but limited for heavy floor tiling, may need modified duties/rest breaks.  
- Recommended housing with ↓stairs if possible. Not certifying permanent incapacity for all work.  

Follow-up  
- Review 1/52 long appt – bloods, DM mgmt, recheck knee.  
- Earlier prn if knee acutely worse or systemic sx.  

Billing: Level C, bulk billed.
