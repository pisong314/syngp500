Follow up – mood/sleep / med cert stuff  

32yo F casual retail, seen ~2 wks ago re low mood/anxiety + poor sleep after breakup + housing/$$ stress. Back today mainly because reception told her to book when did last med cert. Bulk billed.  

Subjective  
Says "doing alright really, other people have it worse" / "don’t want to be a bother". Still low in evenings, tearful some nights, worries about future but still going to most shifts. Sleep still patchy – takes up to 2–3 hrs to get off on bad nights, wakes 4–5am, feels unrefreshed. ~3–4 bad nights/wk. Slight improvement since last visit after trying breathing + bit of a routine.  

No clear anhedonia – still walks dog, sees close friend. Appetite a bit ↓, weight stable by report. Denies suicidal thoughts/self-harm, "I’ve put up with worse, I’ll be fine". No drugs, minimal EtOH.  

Thinks maybe "too much coffee" (3–4 instant/day, last ~5pm) + phone scrolling late "till silly o’clock" not helping.  

No past psych meds, no benzos. No major PMHx.  

Exam  
Looks a bit tired but well, appropriate, good eye contact. Speech normal. Mood "bit flat but okay", affect mildly restricted but reactive. Logical, no psychotic features, no SI/HI. Oriented, insight/judgement intact.  
Vitals today similar to last: BP ~112/70, HR ~80, afebrile, BMI ~23. No tremor, no psychomotor change.  

Assessment  
Adj disorder with mixed anxiety + depressed mood – mild–mod, still clearly linked to breakup + housing/financial stress, <6/12, functioning preserved, mood reactive, no pervasive anhedonia → doesn’t meet MDD at this stage.  
Insomnia 2° to above – slightly better with non-drug measures but ongoing.  
Psychosocial stressors: unstable housing, $$ stress.  

Plan  
- Reassured re dx and usual course; advised need to keep an eye out for progression to major depression / primary anxiety.  
- Brief review of sleep + stress management, reinforced cutting back caffeine (aim ≤2/day, none after ~2pm) and trying to get off phone earlier at night.  
- Encouraged ongoing breathing exercises; introduced idea of setting aside short "worry time" earlier in evening.  
- Discussed options for counselling/CBT (local psych vs low-cost via PHN/headspace etc). Cost + "taking someone else’s spot" are barriers; she’ll think about it.  
- No meds started – explained ADs not indicated for adj disorder currently, benzos not appropriate given mild severity + dependence/sedation risks. She prefers to avoid tablets.  
- Offered GP Mental Health Care Plan – deferred to longer appt due to time today; she agrees to consider.  
- Safety net: low acute risk but advised to come back sooner / ED / 000 / Lifeline/13YARN if mood worsens, feels hopeless or any suicidal thoughts. RTC if sleep deteriorates to point she’s missing work.  

Follow up  
- Review 2–3 wks, book longer appt to reassess mood/sleep/functioning and consider GPMHCP + psych referral if still symptomatic.  
- Can also cover contraception/preventive health then if more settled.

Pt rang reception asking if today’s consult was bulk billed – confirmed yes (standard Level B, no gap). Advised to book 20–30 min for next mental health review.
