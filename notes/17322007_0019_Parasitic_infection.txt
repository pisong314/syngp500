Reason for visit  
R/V headache x 1/52  

Pt  
32 yr old male Indian‑Australian chef known to practice generally well  

Subjective / Hx  

HPC headache  
Onset gradual ~7/7  
Dull band like pressure temples forehead occas occiput non pulsatile  
Severity 4–6/10 worse late in day after long hot kitchen shifts screen use late night  
Builds over day settles o/nil no early am waking  
Relieved by paracetamol 1g up to bd prn rest dark room  
Assoc mild photophobia when very tired  
Nil N/V visual aura focal neurology speech change sensory loss fever neck stiffness rash confusion seizures  
Nil recent head trauma  

Pt query ?dehydration from work pass all night also very concerned re parasites neurocysticercosis after reading online  

Travel / GI / infection hx  
Returned from Mumbai Goa ~3/12 ago 3 week trip nil malaria proph  
Nil acute febrile illness there or on return had 2–3/7 loose stools self resolved  
Last 2–3/52  
- intermittent crampy lower abdo discomfort mild bloating  
- ↑ stool freq 2–3/day from baseline 1/day no overt diarrhoea no blood no mucus no wt loss no nocturnal sx  
- perianal itch nocte intermittent assumed sweat from shifts  

Nil cough SOB jaundice night sweats urinary sx  

Red flag screen headache  
Nil thunderclap nil “worst ever”  
Nil personality or cognitive change  
Nil visual field loss diplopia jaw claudication  
Nil hx malignancy immunosuppression anticoagulation pregnancy  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1 g up to bd prn this wk only  
Nil other reg meds nil recent abx or steroids  

Allergies  
NKDA  

PMH  
Unremarkable nil migraine nil chronic headache nil epilepsy nil known parasitic infection  

FHx  
Nil migraine epilepsy intracranial pathology of note  

SHx  
Chef busy metro restaurant long hours hot environment high stress often skips breaks hydration suboptimal eats irregularly  
Lives with wife no kids wife well nil similar GI or itch  
Non smoker alcohol 2–3 std drinks on days off nil binges nil rec drugs  
Reads guidelines research asks detailed Qs eg “If this were parasitic would you be thinking Strongyloides or Taenia”  

Objective  

Vitals  
BP 118/74 HR 76 reg RR 14 Temp 36.7 SpO2 99% RA BMI 24  

Examination (focused)  
Gen well appearing alert articulat nil distress  
Head neck scalp NT full neck ROM nil meningism  
Neuro CN II–XII grossly intact power 5/5 all limbs coord normal gait incl tandem normal reflexes symm plantars flexor nil focal deficit  
Eyes fundi no papilloedema haemorrhage on limited view  
CVS S1 S2 normal nil murmur chest clear  
Abdo soft mildly bloated NT nil organomegaly masses BS normal  
Skin visible perianal edge nil rash excoriation detailed perianal exam deferred today time + pt pref  

Assessment  

1 New onset tension type headache likely  
Clinical picture c/w episodic TTH bilateral pressure like mild–mod non pulsatile no migrainous features nil neuro deficit vitals normal  
Temporal association with occupational stress ↓sleep probable dehydration screen use  
Screen for red flags negative so low likelihood SAH intracranial mass meningitis encephalitis temporal arteritis CVST etc as per NICE headache guidance style approach  

2 Possible intestinal helminth infection ?threadworm vs other related to recent travel  
Change in bowel habit mild bloating ↑freq without red flags plus perianal itch nocte post travel to endemic region  
Strongyloides / hookworm less likely clinically nil rash nil resp sx nil known eosinophilia immunocompetent but will screen as per usual post‑travel workup  
Neurocysticercosis extremely unlikely in this context nil seizures focal signs or raised ICP picture would expect focal lesions seizures chronic course etc discussed  
Given low symptom burden reasonable to investigate before broader therapy but empiric threadworm cover low risk  

3 Occupational lifestyle factors contributing to headache  
Irregular meals dehydration poor sleep hygiene prolonged standing screen use posture strain conc@work late into night → ↑TTH frequency  

Plan  

1 Headache mx  
Dx explained as likely tension‑type based on pattern exam reassuring emphasised very low prob serious intracranial pathology or neurocysticercosis  
Analgesia  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1 g q6h prn max 4 g/24h avoid >15/30 days simple analgesia to ↓med overuse HA risk  
Non pharm  
- Encourage regular hydration during shifts water bottle @ pass if possible  
- Small reg snacks to avoid long fasting  
- Sleep hygiene basic measures limit screens pre bed etc (briefly discussed)  
Red flag advice given  
- ED / urgent review if sudden severe “worst ever” headache persistent vomiting fever neck stiffness confusion seizures visual change new weakness numbness or rapid progression despite simple measures  

2 Parasite workup + empiric threadworm tx  
Ix ordered today  
- FBE + diff U&E LFTs CRP  
- Stool MCS + OCP x3 on separate days  
- Strongyloides serology  

Empiric therapy  
- Albendazole 400 mg PO stat today  
- Repeat 400 mg PO stat in 2/52 script provided PBS  
Advised wife also to be treated simultaneously via own GP / pharmacist  

Hygiene advice  
Handwashing after toilet before food prep nails short avoid scratching perianal area daily shower change underwear daily hot wash underwear towels bedlinen during tx period  

Explained albendazole broad GI helminth cover but not all eg Strongyloides better with ivermectin schisto with praziquantel etc will tailor if tests positive consider ID / tropical med input if Strongyloides or other systemic parasite detected  

3 Malaria / serious parasitic dx consideration  
Currently afebrile nil anaemia signs nil jaundice nil rigors nil hx febrile illness since return malaria v unlikely at this stage  
Explained delayed malaria possible instruct to present urgently if fevers rigors sweats jaundice dark urine marked malaise → would arrange urgent films possible ED  

4 Imaging / “general parasite screen”  
Pt requested “baseline brain MRI just to be thorough” discussed low pre test probability normal neuro exam benign HA pattern potential incidentalomas cost so MRI not indicated currently as per usual GP headache approach  
Agreed to reconsider imaging only if new red flags or non resolving atypical features after initial mx  

Admin / other  
General health check vaccines etc briefly raised by pt deferred due to time asked to book long appt  
Bulk billed today  

F/U / safety net  
R/V 1–2/52 to  
- assess headache response to conservative mx  
- review bloods stool OCP Strongyloides serology  

Earlier review if  
- HA ↑frequency or severity change in character or any red flag sx  
- GI sx worsen wt loss blood PR severe abdo pain or new systemic sx  

Pt engaged asked re sensitivity specificity of stool OCP serology explained need for 3 samples ↑yield tests not perfect but appropriate first line given current sx pt agreed with plan
