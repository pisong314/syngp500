Reason for visit  
F/U bleeding lesion R index finger r/v options for removal  

S  
32F primary school teacher Anglo Aus  
Known from last wk  
Lesion R index finger still bleeding a lot esp @work with books whiteboard markers  
Says "I really need it properly removed today"  
Onset ~5–6/52 after paper cut → red lump over ~2/52  
Recurrent bleeding with minor trauma  
Mild local tenderness only  
Nil fever nil systemic sx nil spreading redness nil pus  

Unhappy with conservative mx to date feels usual GP would "just cut this off" asking re  
- immediate excision "burn or laser it off now"  
- abx "it looks infected"  
- urgent derm ref "I can’t wait months"  

Other qs  
?school cleaning chemicals + hand sanitiser making it worse  
?coffee "thinning blood"  

PMHx nil sig  
FHx skin ca nil  
Meds nil regular nil anticoag nil OCP  
NKDA  
Non smoker ETOH occas  
Lives with partner stressed managing frequent bleeding dressing changes at school worried re appearance + parents thinking contagious

R hand  
5–6mm bright red friable vascular papule dorsal R index finger near PIP  
Narrow base ~1–2mm small collarette of scale  
Bleeds on light touch but stops with pressure

A  
1 Pyogenic granuloma R index finger symptomatic recurrent bleeding impacting work cosmetic concern  
   - Benign vascular lesion likely post minor trauma  
   - Nil clinical evidence 2° bacterial infection abx not indicated  
2 Time limited short r/v slot today  
   - Pt strongly requesting immediate removal + abx need to balance expectations with what can be done safely in std consult + limited treatment room access today  

Rural / resource context  
Small suburban practice theatre list limited only 1 nurse on today treatment room booked for iron infusion + skin check so unable to do full excision safely in this short appt  
Nearest public derm clinic >3/12 wait private derm locally ~6–8/52  
Pt drives has transport but cost a concern she prefers in‑house option if can be done soon  

P  
# Pyogenic granuloma – mx options  
Discussed dx again benign nature reason for easy bleeding relation to initial paper cut  
Explained options  
- Conservative: protect lesion avoid trauma may persist for mths ongoing bleeding risk  
- In‑house procedure (preferred)  
  • Shave excision + curettage + cautery under LA with histopath  
  • Formal excision + sutures also option but more scarring finger movement issues  
- Cryo discussed ↑recurrence not ideal for this site  
- Derm / plastics ref possible but wait times longer cost issues  

Explained cannot "just cut it off now" in 10min r/v without proper set‑up nurse suction cautery etc ↑risk heavy bleeding incomplete removal recurrence  
Pt initially frustrated but accepted plan when offered earliest proc slot next wk  

Booked  
- Procedure appt 7/7 in treatment room 20–30min shave excision + cautery LA with nurse  
- Specimen to Sullivan Nicolaides path for histopath to confirm PG exclude other vascular / malignant lesion pt aware  

# Immediate care today  
Lesion cleaned with saline dressing applied non‑adherent + tape to reinforce finger ↓trauma @work  
Advised keep dressing dry change if soaked  

Bleeding plan  
- Direct firm pressure 10–15min hand elevated if bleeds  
- If persistent bleeding >20min or soaking through multiple dressings attend ED / urgent care  

Infection red flags discussed  
- ↑pain warmth swelling pus spreading erythema fever → R/V GP or after hours  

# Meds  
Nil oral abx given discussed lack of infection and harms unnecessary abx resistance side effects  
Offered topical chlorhex for brief use pre dressing change if she wants reassurance not essential  
Analgesia simple paracetamol PRN currently minimal pain  

# Referrals / access  
Derm ref discussed  
- Public derm via hospital likely >3/12  
- Private derm in regional centre ~40km away pt states can drive but cost + time off work difficult  
Given these constraints plan for in‑house proc as quickest option she agrees  
If histopath atypical will then ref to derm / plastics via HealthLink  

# Work / school  
Advice  
- Keep lesion covered plaster ± light tubular gauze esp during class  
- Avoid picking removing dressing in front of kids  
Offered med cert if bleeding episodes unmanageable or if needs time off day of procedure she declined for now  

# Education  
Reassured  
- Benign lesion not contagious  
- Unlikely related to cleaning chemicals though frequent irritation + sanitiser may ↑bleeding so suggested gentle handwashing when possible  
- Coffee intake not significantly "thinning" blood for this issue  

# Investigations  
Nil new tests today histopath planned at time of excision  
(Prev routine bloods 03/2024 FBC UEC LFT normal per old results in file)  

Safety net  
RTC earlier if  
- rapid ↑ in size or change colour  
- bleeding not settling with 15min pressure  
- signs infection or feels systemically unwell  

F/U  
- Procedure appt booked 7/7 for shave excision + cautery SN histopath  
- Consider separate longer appt later for routine preventative care cervical screen skin check immunisation review not done today due time and pt priority on lesion removal
