Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024  

Reason for visit  
F/U immunisations for work  
Quick r/v R index finger lesion  

Pt details  
32F retail worker R hand dominant Anglo Aust lives with partner FT retail long shifts limited appt flexibility  

HPI  
Work has asked her to be "up to date with everything" pre Xmas rush  
Unsure last tetanus pertussis booster thinks had COVID primary course 2021 + booster 2022 unsure flu vax this yr  
Nil chronic dx nil preg nil hx anaphylaxis  

Functional impact work  
Customer facing on feet all day manual handling stock opening boxes frequent minor hand cuts from cardboard box cutters  
R index finger lesion bleeding on and off esp when using till handling notes  
Irritating + nuisance rather than painful but affecting function with cash handling and stock work needing to stop to apply bandaids  

Lesion hx  
R index finger lesion noticed ~4–5/52 after nick with box cutter  
Describes small red lump bleeds easily with minor trauma  
Thinks constant ABHR use + cheap bandaids at work might be aggravating  
Nil fevers nil spreading redness nil ↓ROM hand nil other skin lesions  
Nil personal FHx skin ca or melanoma  

Time  
Pt in hurry "only got 10 minutes" repeatedly checking phone asking if we can "just freeze it today" explained need for booked procedure time pt reluctantly ok  

PMHx  
Generally well nil chronic meds  
NKA  
Nil reg meds  

Immunisation hx (AIR + recall – partial)  
Childhood schedule complete  
Last documented dTpa >10yrs ago  
COVID Pfizer x2 2021 + booster 2022 nil 2023/24 boosters  
Flu vax 2023 none yet 2025  

Obs  
BP 112/70 HR 76 RR 14 Temp 36.7C SpO2 99% RA  
Looks well NAD  

Exam – MSK / functional focus  
Hands overall  
Grip strength WNL bilat able to make full fist open hand against resistance  
Fine motor intact able to fast finger tap count coins simulate till use without difficulty  

R index finger  
Dorsolateral aspect just distal to PIPJ  
Approx 5–6mm red friable dome papule on narrow stalk moist surface  
Mild bleed on light contact during exam settles with direct pressure  
Nil surrounding erythema warmth induration nil pus  
Full active + passive ROM PIP DIP MCP no pain  
Sensation intact cap refill normal hand function preserved  

Gait posture  
Independent gait normal pattern stable stance able to weight bear fully nil issues noted on brief obs walking to door  

Assessment  

1 Immunisation catch up – work related  
Needs update for occupational exposure frequent minor hand injuries customer contact  
- dTpa booster indicated (last >10yrs)  
- Seasonal influenza vax due  
- COVID booster recommended ATAGI given last dose >12/12 pt declined today time constraints open to future  

2 R index finger lesion – likely pyogenic granuloma  
Small vascular lesion at prior trauma site typical PG appearance  
Benign but functionally limiting at work due to recurrent bleeding with manual tasks  
Nil red flag features today nil pigment nil atypical borders nil nodes nil systemic sx  
Best mgt likely shave excision / curettage + cautery with histopath to exclude amelanotic melanoma or other vascular lesion though suspicion low  

3 Fatigue ?  
Pt briefly mentioned "abit tired lately" but deferred full workup due time  
Plan separate consult post Xmas to explore  

Plan  

#1 Immunisations today  
- dTpa (Boostrix) 0.5mL IM given L deltoid  
- Influenza vax 2025 season inactivated 0.5mL IM R deltoid  
- Observed 10 mins post vax nil immediate adverse  
- Counselling re expected local reaction sore arm mild fever fatigue paracetamol PRN  
- Safety net re anaphylaxis or severe reaction ED  

COVID vax  
Discussed current ATAGI recs booster advised as last dose 2022  
Pt "really need to get back to work lets park that for now" will reconsider at later r/v  
Flu vax given – AIR updated  
Bulk billed today  

#2 R index finger pyogenic granuloma – functional / procedural plan  
Education  
- Explained benign vascular overgrowth tends to persist + bleed with minor trauma  
- Discussed impact on work tasks handling money stock opening boxes etc  
- Options  
  • Shave excision or curettage under LA + electrocautery or chemical cautery  
  • Send specimen for histopath  
  • Conservative dressings generally slower ↓success not ideal given work demands  
Pt preference quickest one off solution ok with procedure booking  

Interim functional management  
- Keep area clean dry at work  
- Non adherent dressing if needed avoid very sticky tape that may irritate  
- Direct pressure if bleed  
- Watch for ↑redness warmth pain pus fever → early r/v  

Procedure booking  
- Booked long minor procedure appt in ~2/52 with nurse assist for R index finger lesion  
- Planned technique LA + shave/curettage + cautery specimen to histopath to confirm PG exclude other neoplasm  
- Will need brief functional check post procedure re grip strength ROM for work duties  

Safety net  
If lesion grows rapidly changes colour becomes painful or bleeding uncontrolled despite pressure → urgent r/v or ED  

#3 Fatigue  
Not addressed today due time  
Plan standard consult after Xmas for full hx exam bloods FBC U&E LFT TFT ferritin B12 etc  
To assess impact on work stamina ADLs  

F/U  
- 2/52 minor procedure appt R index finger  
- Earlier PRN if infection signs or problematic bleeding or vax reaction  
- Future standard appt post Xmas for fatigue + COVID booster discussion
