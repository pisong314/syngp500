32M – gambling  

CC: “Pokies are running my life a bit”  

HPC  
– Works gaming room in pub → easy access  
– EGM most days now, mainly own venue ± nearby club, some late-night online sports betting  
– Ongoing ≥12/12, worse post-COVID reopen  
– Preoccupied: “thinking which machine is due even at dinner with Mum”  
– Poor control: plans $50/home by 9pm → stays hrs, spends “few hundred”  
  Last wk ~ $1200 over 3 nights  
– Harms:  
  • $$: behind on credit card/Afterpay, small personal loan, “one good night will fix it”  
  • Rel: ↑ conflict ex re child support, mum “on my back about money again”  
  • Activities dropped – no gym/fishing, “rather have the cash for a spin”  
– Tangential historian, needs frequent redirection  

Screen  
– Brief PG screen 2Q both +ve → probable gambling disorder  
– PGSI not completed – time, tangential  

Mood / risk / AOD  
– Mood “flat and stressed” re losses/debt only. No persistent low mood/anhedonia outside gambling context  
– No current SI/plan. Occ “easier to disappear” but denies intent. Protective: daughter, close to mum  
– Anxiety mostly $$ worries + insomnia post losses. No panic  
– ETOH: 3–4 beers after late shifts, 6–7 on pay nights. No AM drinking, no blackouts per pt  
– No other drugs  
– Sleep poor – on phone, late-night betting to 2–3am  

Psych hx  
– Past psych in 20s after “big blow-up at work, smashed a glass”  
– Told “personality disorder, kind of borderline”, impulsive, “react big when people upset me”  
– Did some DBT groups, stopped. No current psych, no meds, no past admissions  

PMHx  
– Nil sig medical. No reg meds, NKDA  

O/E (brief)  
BP 124/78 HR 82 RR 14 SpO2 99% RA afeb. BMI ~26  
Well, no distress  
MSE: tangential but cooperative, mildly fidgety. Speech ↑ when on gambling. Mood “stressed, bit ashamed”, affect congruent. No psychosis. Insight fair re gambling, judgement impaired around chasing losses  

Impr  
1) Gambling disorder – mod–severe. Preoccupation + impaired control + chasing + financial/relational harm, ongoing despite consqs. Major RF = employment in gaming room + impulsive traits  
2) Personality disorder (likely cluster B / BPD traits) – contrib to impulsivity/emotional dysreg  
3) At risk mood/anxiety d/o + possible future ETOH misuse if pattern continues  
No acute suicide risk today but high psychosocial/financial risk if ongoing  

Plan  
– Brief MI today: explored pros/cons. Pt: short-term buzz vs “sick feeling in the guts when I lose”, debt, fights. Pt goal: ↓ freq, esp stop playing at own venue; longer term “pay bills and not think about pokies all the time”  
– Harm reduction focus this visit (time)  
  • Money: advised ↓/cancel credit card limit, consider mum helping manage card/weekly cash. Discussed bank gambling blocks / ↓ ATM limits  
  • Access: discussed self-exclusion from local venues (esp non-work). Work venue more complex – to explore next review  
  • Triggers: high risk after late shifts, pay days, arguments. Suggested alt routine (home/gym/phone call to mum instead of gaming room)  
– Info given re GambleAware / state gambling helpline + free financial counselling. Reassured about confidentiality. Pt “don’t want it on my record” but agreed to try call this wk. Offered nurse-assisted call next visit  
– Self-help: suggested 100 Day Challenge + Reset/Gamble Less app (track urges/spend)  
– Psych: rec referral psych with CBT for gambling + DBT-type skills. Pt agreeable to GP Mental Health Care Plan but no time today  
– Meds: none started. Briefly discussed naltrexone as specialist option but will prioritise psych + gambling svc first  
– Safety: advised if ↑ distress or any self-harm thoughts → ED / 000 / Lifeline 13 11 14  

F/up  
– Booked long appt 1/52 for:  
  • PGSI + K10 ± DASS  
  • GP MHP + psych/gambling svc referral  
  • More detailed plan re self-exclusion + finances  
– Tasks for pt:  
  • Track gambling episodes (date/venue/$/mood pre/post)  
  • Aim ≥2 “no gambling” days this wk, esp non-work days, avoid online betting after midnight  

RTC earlier if mood worsens / SI / gambling escalation.
