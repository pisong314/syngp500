HPI  
32F, hx diet‑related folate def w macrocytic anaemia dx ~3/12 ago.  
Completed 3/12 folic acid 5mg mane. Very good adherence, feels “a lot better”.  
No current fatigue, SOB, CP, palps, neuro sx, bleeding/bruising, GI sx. Menses normal.  
Not preg, not TTC, condoms only, no plans x “couple of years”.  
No hx coeliac/IBD/GI surg/chronic D+/ETOH excess/B12 issues/folate‑affecting meds.

Prev ix (3/12 ago)  
FBC: Hb 104 g/L, MCV 103 fL, WCC/Plt N  
Serum folate low  
B12 N  
LFT, UEC N

Exam (home)  
Well, NAD, not pale or icteric. Obs N (BP 112/68, HR 76, afeb). CVS/resp/abdo/neuro grossly N.

Impression  
1) Folate def anaemia – diet‑related, clinically improved on tx. Need confirm haematol recovery.  
2) Future preg planning – average risk, not currently TTC.

Plan  
Ix:  
- FBC, serum folate, B12 ordered (local path). Trend vs prior: expect Hb↑, MCV↓. Results via telehealth/RTC.

Meds:  
- Continue folic acid 5mg PO daily.  
  Rx: Folic acid 5mg tabs, 1 daily, qty 60, 1 rpt (PBS).  
- If next FBC/folate/B12 all N → consider ↓ to 500mcg daily or cease if diet reliable (decide after results).

Counsel (brief):  
- Likely dietary + irregular meals. Coffee/late nights unlikely primary cause.  
- For future preg: start 400–500mcg daily ≥1/12 pre‑conception → 1st trimester. Book pre‑conception appt when planning.

FU / safety net  
- Telehealth/RTC 2–3/52 to review FBC/folate/B12 + adjust dose/duration.  
- RTC earlier if ↑fatigue, SOB, CP, palps, neuro sx, heavy bleeding etc.  

Pt agrees, will do bloods this week, understands to continue tabs until review.
