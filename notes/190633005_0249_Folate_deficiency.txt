CC: f/up bloods re “folate” + tired  

HPC  
Months fatigue, worse end of shifts. No SOB, CP, palps. No bleed hx. Menses reg, not heavy. Diet poor re veg/folate, lots takeaway, skips meals. Not preg, condoms sometimes, not trying yet but “maybe in next couple of years”.

Looks a bit pale, otherwise NAD CVS/Resp/Abdo unremarkable  

Impr  
1) Folate deficiency megaloblastic anaemia – likely dietary (low veg/folate, irreg meals). B12 checked & nl so ok to treat  
2) Preconception issues – not currently TTC but likely future preg → needs folate education later  

Plan  
- Start folic acid 1 mg PO daily x 4/12 (PBS)  
- Brief expl re role folate, reassured B12 already done so no masking B12 neuropathy  
- Diet: ↑ folate foods (leafy greens, legumes, fortified breads/cereals) – kept v brief  
- Limit energy drinks/caffeine a bit, not cause of anaemia but not helping fatigue  

Tests  
- Repeat FBE + serum folate in 4–6/52 (forms given today)  

Preg/preconception  
- For now: high-dose course as above for deficiency  
- If/when planning preg → switch to 400–500 mcg folic acid daily from ≥1/12 pre-conception to 12/40 – to discuss properly at longer appt  
- Offered longer preconception/contraception review – pt keen, will book  

Safety net  
RTC/ED if ↑ fatigue, SOB at rest, CP, palps, syncope, new bleed, neuro sx (numb/tingle/gait).  
Headaches after long shifts mentioned – likely multifactorial, advised separate appt if ongoing/worse (no time today).  

F/up  
Review 5–6/52 with repeat bloods prior.
