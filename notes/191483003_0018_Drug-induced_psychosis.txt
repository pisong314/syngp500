27yo male – temp younger-person bed crisis accommodation

PC: review post ED psychosis episode  
“Just here for a check‑up… they said you wanted to see me because of what happened the other week”  

HPI  
ED ~2/52 ago – acute agitation + VH/AH + paranoia after heavy stim use (“speed, maybe something else mixed in”). Obs only, no formal admit, no AP started. Settled over ~24–36h. No current CTO/section.  

Today:  
- Denies AH/VH: “not seeing or hearing stuff anymore”  
- No paranoia, no thought d/o, thinking “pretty clear now”  
- Mood: “stressed about work + money but not depressed”  
- Sleep now 7–8h, appetite ok  
- No SI/SH, no agg  
- Insight +: “If I keep using, it’ll probably happen again”  

Substance use (brief)  
- Meth: wknd, on/off 1–2 yrs. Last ~2/52 ago (index event)  
- Cannabis: occas, nil x10d  
- EtOH: binge wknds 8–10 beers, no AM drinking, no w/d  
- Tob: 10–15 cig/d  
- No IVDU, denies other party chems  

MSE (focused)  
Calm, cooperative, good eye contact  
Speech nl  
Mood “stressed but alright” affect full / reactive  
TP linear, goal‑directed  
TC: no delusions, no ideas of ref, no SI/HI  
Perception: no current AH/VH  
Oriented, cognition grossly intact  
Insight/judgement intact  

Exam  
Obs stable: BP 118/72 HR 78 RR 14 T 36.6 SpO₂ 99% RA  
No focal neuro signs, looks well NAD  

Dx  
1) Drug‑induced psychosis 2° meth – now resolved  
   → clear temporal link to stim use, sx resolved >2/52, no ongoing psychotic features today  
2) Stimulant use d/o (harmful) ± risky EtOH/cannabis  
3) Psychosocial stress (housing/work) – not explored in detail today  

Ix  
Baseline bloods ordered via Sullivan Nicolaides:
- FBC, UEC, LFT  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
- Lipids  
- TFTs  
- B12, folate  
- ESR/CRP  
Results pending – for next r/v

Plan  
- No AP at present → sx resolved, low acute risk  
- Discussed dx: likely drug‑induced psychosis, not clear primary psychotic d/o at this stage  
- Strong advice: complete abstinence from stims, ↓/avoid cannabis + heavy EtOH  
- Pt: “I want to knock the gear on the head – sick of feeling out of control”  
- Refer:  
  → ACCHS for MH/AOD support (via facility SW)  
  → Community AOD counselling (transport via SW)
- RN to monitor behaviour/sleep, flag any ↑ agitation, AH/VH, paranoia, mood drop

Safety net  
- If recurrence psychotic sx, SI/SH, or feels “no good in the head” → tell staff / 000 / ED  
- If persistent sx >4/52 sober → reassess for primary psychosis, consider AP + psych review / CMHT  

F/U  
- GP review 5–7/7 or earlier if staff concerned
- Longer review later for full physical, STI screen, vax, more detailed AOD counselling (not done today – time)  

Pt summary (own words): “So this was likely from the drugs, and if I stay off them it’s less likely to happen again. If it comes back when I’m clean, I need to get help straight away” – agrees with plan.
