A:  
1) Seborrhoeic dermatitis – mild-mod face/scalp  
2) Episodic cluster HA – in remission, stable on verapamil  

P:  

1) Seb derm  
- Ketoconazole 2% cream OD to face 2–4/52 then PRN  
- Hydrocortisone 1% cream BD to red/itchy areas face max 5–7/7 then stop, short bursts PRN future flares  
- Ketoconazole 2% shampoo 2–3x/week scalp (leave 3–5 mins)  
- RTC if worse / no better 3–4/52 / pain/pus  

2) Cluster HA  
- Cont verapamil IR 160 mg TDS (repeat script, limited repeats pending neuro review)  
- ECG 12‑lead done today in rooms given high-dose verapamil – result pending, will call if PR >200 ms / AV block / brady  
- Cont sumatriptan 6 mg s/c for acute attacks max 2/24h & ≤10/month (repeat script)  
- Cont home O2 as first line where available  
- Red flag advice given – ED if sudden different “worst ever” HA, neuro deficit, fever/neck stiffness, visual change, or suicidal thoughts  

Admin  
- Mostly rash + brief HA/med review today.  
- Pt asked re “natural supplements” for clusters – defer to longer appt + check neuro letters.  

F/up: 3–4/52 review rash + ECG/verapamil; earlier if HA pattern change, cardiac sx, rash deterioration  

Billing: likely standard Level B, bulk billed today.
