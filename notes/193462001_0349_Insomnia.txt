29F RN new pt  

PC: sleep / results. Also "all my other bits and pieces" but time limited  

Hx  
Insomnia ~9–10/12. Diff getting off to sleep (60–90min), wakes 2–3x, "feel like I’m running on empty". Est 4–5h broken sleep on work days, 6h if "really push it" on days off. Worse with shift changes.  
↑ caffeine (3–4 coffees, last often 5–6pm). Screens in bed, checks work emails. Sleeps in late on days off.  
Pre‑sleep rumination "brain won’t switch off, replaying work stuff". Mood "ok just tired and a bit snappy". Denies ↓ mood, anhedonia, SI.  
No snoring, apnoeas, RLS, parasomnias, narcolepsy sx. No EtOH for sleep. No benzos/sedatives.  

Prev tests (from last visit here)  
FBE: Hb 124 g/L (LLN), MCV 86, WCC/Plt N  
Ferritin 18 µg/L (low‑N) iron studies o/wise N  
B12/folate, U&E, LFT, fasting BSL, TSH 1.8 all N  

Sleep diary (2/52)  
Bed 2200–0100, wake 0500–1100 (shift dep).  
Sleep latency 45–90min, WAwakening 40–60min, TST 4–6h (eff ~65–70%).  
Caffeine up to 4 cups, often after 1500. Screens in bed nightly.  

Other issues today (not fully done – no time)  
– R shoulder ache months, worse after long shifts, no injury, still working  
– Also wants "bowels, skin, toe, palpitations, travel vax" checked → deferred  

Exam (targeted)  
Looks tired but well. BMI WNL. CV/resp abdo grossly NAD. Mood congruent, no psychosis.  

Impression  
1) Chronic insomnia – multifactorial: shift work + poor sleep hygiene + mild work‑related anxiety. No red flags for OSA, MDD, thyroid, sig med cause  
2) Borderline low iron stores likely 2° menses – may contribute to fatigue, no RLS  
3) Multiple minor issues – non‑urgent, need separate appt  

Plan  
Insomnia  
– Explained likely dx, chronic, no clear secondary cause on bloods  
– Emphasis non‑drug mgmt first line (RN, safety critical)  
– Sleep hygiene/CBT‑I discussed briefly:  
  • Regular bed/wake as able around shifts  
  • Stop caffeine after lunch, ↓ total intake  
  • No phone/TV in bed; if not asleep ~20–30min → get up, quiet activity, back when sleepy  
  • Limit long sleep‑ins / naps  
– Referred self‑directed CBT‑I: This Way Up insomnia program + CBT‑i Coach app (pt has smartphone, keen)  
– Pt: "can’t you just give me something to knock me out, even just on my run of nights?" → discussed risks (next‑day sedation, dependence, shift work, RN) + guidelines. Agreed no hypnotic for now. Will reconsider SHORT course only if poor response despite good engagement with CBT‑I  

Iron  
– Start OTC oral iron (e.g. ferrous sulfate daily with food + vit C) – warned re black stools/constipation  
– Dietary ↑ iron, avoid tea/coffee with iron‑rich meals  
– Repeat FBE + ferritin in ~3/12 or earlier if ↑ fatigue/SOB/palps  

Other issues  
– Shoulder: explained no time for full MSK work‑up today. No red flag sx on brief screen. Advised book std appt.  
– Other "shopping list" (bloating, mole, toenail, palps, travel vax) documented only – to be done over 1–2 longer appts. Red flags explained re shoulder (acute severe pain, trauma, weakness) and palps (syncope, CP, SOB) → ED if occur  

Safety net  
RTC sooner if insomnia markedly worse (no sleep several nights, cannot function, mood drop or SI) or if new sx (snoring, witnessed apnoeas, RLS, psychotic features). Avoid driving if very sleepy.  

F/up  
– 3–4/52 review insomnia, sleep diary, response to CBT‑I / hygiene, reconsider meds if needed  
– Book separate std appt for shoulder + other concerns
