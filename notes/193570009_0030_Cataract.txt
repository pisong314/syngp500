Follow up eyes / cataracts  

74F, known health anxiety, here after seeing optom + ophthalmology re “cataracts” – very anxious re going blind / infection from surgery. Lots of googling.  

Keeps asking “are you sure I won’t go blind if we wait” and “what if it’s a cancer behind the eye, do I need scans or blood tests”. Reassured multiple times, still seeking confirmation.  

Vision: gradual decline over ~1–2 yrs, worse last 6/12. Night driving now avoided – glare/haloes from headlights. Needs bright light + stronger readers for small print.  
No sudden loss of vision, no curtain, no flashes/floaters. No eye pain/redness/discharge, no headache, N/V.  

Worried detergents/cleaning products and using phone “too close” have “caused” cataracts – explained age-related, no clear link.  

PMHx: health anxiety. No DM, no steroids, no eye trauma/sx. Non-smoker.  
Meds: PRN paracetamol only. NKDA.  

O/E  
BP 134/78, HR 76 reg, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA. Looks well, a bit anxious but calm.  
Eyes: VA with current specs R 6/12, L 6/9, pinhole both 6/9. PERRL, no RAPD. EOMI. Conj clear, no injection. Ant chambers look deep/quiet with torch. Lens opacities both eyes, R > L (nuclear). No obvious red flags. Neuro grossly normal.  

Ophthalmology letter (today scanned + read):  
– Dx: bilateral age-related nuclear sclerotic cataracts, R>L.  
– IOP normal, fundus NAD.  
– Plan: conservative for now, optimise glasses/lighting. Consider cataract extraction + IOL when function significantly affected. Review 6/12, sooner if rapid change/pain/acute sx. Note about routine intracameral + topical ABx for endophthalmitis prophylaxis.  

A:  
1) Age-related bilateral cataracts R>L – confirmed by ophthalmology, not yet for surgery. No features of acute angle closure, retinal detachment, intraocular infection today.  
2) Health anxiety – prominent, focused on fear of blindness and post-op infection, requesting unnecessary tests.  

P:  
– Reassured re benign, age-related nature, no sign of cancer or other sinister cause → no indication for bloods/imaging at this stage.  
– Explained cataract surgery is elective, based on function; common and generally safe day procedure in Aus, infection risk low with standard ABx protocol but serious if occurs.  
– Advised continue to avoid night driving given glare. Use good lighting and updated glasses while waiting.  
– Keep ophthalmology f/up in ~6/12; to contact them earlier if rapid deterioration in vision / can’t manage ADLs / driving safety concerns.  
– Discussed anxiety briefly, offered longer separate appt to focus on health anxiety / CBT referral etc – she is agreeable.  
– No investigations ordered today. No new meds. Peri-op drops to be managed by ophthalmologist if/when surgery booked.  
– Safety-net: seek urgent review/ED if sudden visual loss, curtain over vision, new large floaters/flashes, severe eye pain, marked redness, or feeling systemically unwell.  

F/up:  
– GP review ~3/12 or earlier if vision changes quickly or anxiety around eyes significantly impacting sleep/function.  
– Book long appt for mental health / health anxiety when ready.
