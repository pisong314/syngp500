Likely benign lesion  
DDx AK (solar keratosis) vs mild dermatitis/eczema vs seb keratosis less likely early NMSC based on hx only  
Needs F2F exam + dermatoscopy non urgent but timely given age fair skin sun exposure FHx NMSC  

2 Age related cataracts both eyes mild  
Stable sx currently not yet functionally disabling  
Unrelated to R forearm lesion and to lubricating drops  
Cont routine optom r/v cataract surgery likely in future if vision impacts ADLs/driving
