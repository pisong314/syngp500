CC:  
Itchy rash forearms – review

HPI:  
27y M apprentice electrcian. Rash both forearms ~10 days. Phone consult 5 days ago, started sorbolene + avoiding new work soap.

Still itchy but a bit beter. Worse after work, evenings. No pain, no fevers, no blisters, no weeping.  
Works outdoors, pushes sleeves up, uses new “orange” heavy duty degreaser 2–3 wks. Also more sun. Says soap “really stings if I leave it on”. Thinks maybe from that or “too much Red Bull”.  

Known red‑green colour vision defic, struggles to tell if rash “redder or not” – wife says gone from red to more brown.

Meds: nil reg.  
Allergies: NKDA.  
PMHx: congential red‑green colour blindness only.

Telehealth exam (limited video):  
Well, NAD, talking full sentnces.  
Skin: bilat forearms with patchy erythematous papular rash over extensor surf, R>L. No obvious vesicles, no crust, no pus, no sig swelling. Hands and palms spared. Looks non‑infected.

Impression:  
1) Irritant contact dermatits – forearms, likely occuptional (new industrial soap/cleaners + sweat/friction, +/- sun/fibreglass). Mild–mod, slightly improving with emollient + partial avoidence.  
2) Congenital red‑green colour vision defic – stable, makes self‑monitoring rash colour difficult, no new visual sx.

Plan:  

1) Irritant contact dermatitis  
- Stop new “orange” heavy duty soap at work if poss, use milder soap.  
- Encourage PPE (long sleves / nitrile gloves) when safe.  
- Continue sorbolene liberally.  
- Start hydrocortisone 1% cream, thin layer to affected areas BD 5–7 days then OD as settlng, max 2 wks w/out review. Avoid face/groin/broken skin.  
- Cetirizine 10mg nocte PRN itch – pt reluctant to take tabs, will use only if itch affecting sleep.  
- Red flags: in‑person/ED if rapid spread, hot/painful, marked swelling, fever, blisters or skin peeling.  
- Follow‑up telehealth 7–10 days or earlier if worse. If persits >2–3 wks despite avoid + steroid, arrange face‑to‑face and consider derm/patch testing.

2) Colour vision defic  
- Long‑standing, no acute change. Reassured.  
- Advised continue using labelling/multimeter at work, not rely on wire colour.  
- Offerd optom/ophthal review for baseline/occpn doco; pt declined (“getting by fine”).

Wife (in background) reports she pushed him to book as rash “wasn’t going away” but agrees it looks a bit better now.

Deferred:  
Tiredness/headaches after long hot days – asked to book separate appt if ongoing.

RTC/telehealth if not improving or any concerns.
