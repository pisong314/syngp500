74M “proper check-up top to toe” → really PAD / DM / HF / CKD review + health anxiety  

Hx  
Known PAD (ABI mild-mod 18/12 ago), CHF (prob HFpEF), T2DM >10y, CKD3b, HTN, HCL, ex-smoker 40py (quit 8y)  

Legs: calf ache R>L after ~150–200m flat, settles in mins w rest. Present “months maybe longer”. No rest pain, no ulcers, no colour change, no neuro sx. Worried re “gangrene” / “full body scan” / cancer. Feet “cold at night”. No red flag sx today.  

No CP, no SOB at rest. Mild exertional SOB on hills “same as last year”. No PND, orthopnoea 1 pillow only, no ↑oedema, wt stable by report.  
DM: BSL home checks sporadic, mostly 6–9 fasting, occas 10–11 post-prand esp when “comfort eating biscuits” when anxious.  
CKD: no loin pain, no ↓UO, no haematuria.  

Marked health anxiety + frequent attender (last 3/52 for cough). Long list of Qs incl “PAD → more cancers?”. Wants headaches + “funny finger” discussed but no time today.  

Meds (confirmed):  
- Aspirin 100 mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte  
- Perindopril 5 mg mane  
- Bisoprolol 5 mg mane  
- Furosemide 20 mg mane  
- Metformin XR 500 mg bd  
- Empagliflozin 10 mg mane  
- PPI prn  
NKDA. Adherent.  

Obs: BP 132/66, HR 68 reg, RR 14, SpO₂ 97% RA, afebrile, BMI 29  

Exam (targeted)  
Gen: well, mildly anxious ++ questions  
CVS: HS dual, no added, JVP not ↑, no oedema  
Resp: clear  
Abdo: soft, NT, no masses  
PVD: feet warm, CRT N, no ulcers. DP ↓ bilat, PT ↓/difficult esp R. Femoral +, no bruits heard today. No calf tender, no asym swelling.  
Neuro LL: grossly N incl light touch soles  
Brief DM foot check: monofilament intact, nails thickened only  

Ix (last 3/12 – recall)  
HbA1c 7.4% (acceptable for age/comorb – was 7.1% ~9/12 ago per old note)  
Lipids: TC 4.1, LDL 1.7, HDL 1.0, TG 1.8 on atorva 40  
U&E: eGFR 38 (CKD3b, stable), Cr 145, K 4.8  
FBP WNL  

A  
1) PAD w intermittent claudication – stable, no ALI / CLTI (no rest pain, no tissue loss). Main issue = anxiety > sx progression  
2) T2DM – mod control for age (HbA1c 7.4%), high vascular risk, on metformin + SGLT2i  
3) CHF (likely HFpEF) – clinically stable euvolaemic  
4) CKD3b – stable on ACEi + SGLT2i, needs routine monitoring  
5) Health anxiety / somatic focus – driving repeated presentations + requests for “scan everything”  

P  
PAD / vascular risk  
- Reassured sx = stable claudication, no signs gangrene / acute ischaemia today  
- Encouraged walking program (walk to mod discomfort → rest → repeat). Avoid inactivity fear  
- Continue: aspirin 100 mane, atorvastatin 40 nocte, perindopril, bisoprolol, frusemide as per HF, SGLT2i  
- Discussed briefly dual pathway (aspirin + low-dose rivaroxaban) given polyvascular risk → needs longer discussion re bleed risk + PBS etc. Defer to long review / poss cardiology/vascular input  
- Foot care advice quick; podiatry ref sent (DM/PAD risk)  

DM / CKD / HF  
- No med changes today – stable, time-limited  
- Avoid NSAIDs, maintain hydration w SGLT2i  
- Ordered pre-review bloods (clinic collection):  
  • HbA1c  
  • U&E/eGFR, LFTs  
  • Lipids  
  • FBP  
  • Urine ACR  

Health anxiety  
- Validated but gently challenged catastrophising  
- Explained not doing “full body scan” in absence of red flags  
- Suggested long appt to go through list + consider MHCP / psych strategies – pt agreed if can bring “all my notes”  

Safety net  
- Red flags explained: sudden severe leg pain, pale/cold limb, loss of movement/sensation, rapidly ↑ulcer/colour change, spreading cellulitis, new CP or acute SOB → ED / urgent review  
- Reassured currently no features suggestive of cancer / gangrene. Will investigate promptly if new specific sx  

Deferred today (no time)  
- Headaches  
- “Funny feeling” in finger  
- Detailed discussion re rivaroxaban + broader cancer screening  

Plan / f/up  
- Long review 2–3/52 for: bloods, PAD/vascular optimisation (incl poss aspirin + low-dose rivaroxaban, HF review), address anxiety + other sx  
- Earlier if leg sx worsen (↓walk distance, night/rest pain, ulcers etc) or any red flags
