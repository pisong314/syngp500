23F Aboriginal – known ARF/RHD (mild MR) on BPG q28/7 – urgent review bloods  

CC: “worried the fever’s coming back” / ↑ESR/CRP  

HPI  
ARF dx 4/12 ago (polyarthritis + carditis, mild MR on echo) on RHD program BPG 1.2MU IM q28/7 – pt says “haven’t missed a needle” last 10/7 at AMS (in MHR)  

ED 1/52 ago – low‑grade temp, sore knees/ankles, fatigue → ?ARF flare → d/c with FU GP + repeat bloods  

Now:  
- Knees/ankles still mildly achy/stiff esp end of shift, better with rest + occasional Nurofen (<3/wk)  
- No obvious swelling/red/hot joints, walking/working OK “nothing like that first time, that was awful”  
- Intermittent fatigue “a bit washed out”  
- Denies CP, SOB, PND, orthopnoea, palps, syncope, ↓exercise tol  
- No rash, nodules, chorea, skin sores  
- Mild sore throat ~3–4/52 ago, settled, none now  

ED bloods 7/7 ago:  
- CRP 38 (H) ESR 42 (H)  
- FBC WCC 8.4 Hb 125 Plt 320 N  
- U&E/LFT/TFT N  
- Trop -ve, ECG SR, PR upper N (no clear ↑)  

Pt worried “does this mean my heart’s getting worse” and if “needles making the numbers high”  

Meds  
- BPG 1.2MU IM q28/7 (RHD prophylaxis) – up to date  
- Ibuprofen 200–400mg PRN joint pain  

SH: works hospitality long shifts on feet  

O/E  
Obs: BP 108/68 HR 86 RR 14 T 37.4 SpO2 99% RA BMI 23  
CVS: dual HS, soft pansystolic murmur apex→axilla (known MR), no added sounds, no oedema, JVP N  
Resp: clear  
MSK: knees/ankles full ROM, mild diffuse periarticular T bilat, no effusion, no erythema, no warmth, gait N, no single hot joint  
Neuro: no chorea  
ENT: throat looks fine, no LN  

Ix today  
- Repeat CRP, ESR, FBC  
- ASOT + anti‑DNase B  
- ECG today: SR 82, PR 0.20s (borderline but same as prior), no ST/T changes  

Impression  
1) ↑ESR/CRP in known ARF/RHD – mild polyarthralgia only, afebrile, haemodynamically stable, no HF, no new major Jones criteria → more c/w non‑specific inflammation / post‑infective / minor flare rather than definite recurrent ARF but high‑risk → low threshold escalate  
2) Definite ARF with mild RHD – on 2° prophylaxis, adherent  
3) Fatigue – likely multifactorial (recent viral vs inflammation vs work)  

Plan  
- Continue BPG 1.2MU IM q28/7 via RHD program – reassured injections not causing ↑markers, are protective “don’t want a bad heart like Nan”  
- Analgesia: OK to cont occasional ibuprofen (max 400mg TDS with food, short periods only). If pain ↑/function limited → trial naproxen 250mg BD with food up to 5/7 then stop; if needs >1/52 → review  
- Today’s bloods: CRP/ESR/FBC/ASOT/anti‑DNase B – will check results  
   → If CRP still >30 or ↑ and/or sx worsen → urgent echo via cardiology + consider hosp review for ?recurrent ARF  
- No evidence septic arthritis / HF / acute carditis today  

Safety net (brief)  
- ED if fever ≥38, single hot swollen very painful joint, new/worse SOB, CP, palps, syncope, rapid wt gain  
- RTC sooner if joints or fatigue significantly worse  

Work  
- Advised pacing, avoid big OT while feeling “washed out”  
- Work cert provided – up to 3 days lighter duties if needed  

FU  
- Review 1/52 with results + sx check  
- Arrange earlier if labs very ↑ or any red flags  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed.
