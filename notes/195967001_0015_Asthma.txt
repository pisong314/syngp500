32F new pt. Collapse at work today. Hx asthma.

Hx:  
At school on playground duty → felt chest tight + lightheaded → next recall on ground, colleagues around. Witness rpt no convulsions, no incontinence, no tongue bite. No palps, no CP, no focal neurol sx, no HA. ?vasovagal vs other benign syncope. Came to quickly (<1 min per rpt), no post‑ictal, just shaky. Did not go to ED. No prev syncope. No known cardiac hx. No FHx SCD/arrhythmia (pt denies). Not preg by hx.  

Asthma: dx teen yrs. SABA only (salbutamol pMDI PRN). Last 1–2/52 ↑ wheeze/SOB w stairs + reading in class. Night cough 3–4x/wk. SABA most days. No ICU/intub. Last ED yrs ago. Lots of dust/URTIs at school.  

Today: mild chest tight AM → salb 2 puffs ~1hr pre‑event, partial relief. During collapse not typical severe asthma per pt, colleagues no audible wheeze. No rash/swelling/GI → anaphylaxis unlikely.  

OE (relevant only):  
Looks well, talking full sentences  
BP 112/72 HR 86 reg RR 16 SpO₂ 98% RA afeb  
Chest: mild end‑exp wheeze bilat, no use accessory mm  
CVS: HS dual no murmur  
Neuro grossly non‑focal, gait normal  

Peak flow 430 L/min (pt says best ~500).  

ECG 12‑lead in rooms: NSR ~80, normal axis, no ST/T abn, no delta, QTc not ↑ on quick check.  

Imp:  
1) Transient collapse – likely vasovagal / benign syncope. No red flags today (no exertional CP, no palps, normal ECG, rapid recovery, no focal neuro, no post‑ictal). Life‑threatening asthma/anaphylaxis unlikely given hx + exam. First event → basic w/up.  
2) Asthma – poor control (daytime sx most days, noct sx, ↑ SABA). Not acute severe today. Needs step‑up.  

Plan:  
Syncope:  
- Ix: FBC, UEC, LFT, fasting BSL, HbA1c, iron studies, B12, folate, TSH → SN/QML (pt preference)  
- Advice: keep hydrated, regular meals, avoid prolonged standing/heat where poss  
- Safety: if recur esp w CP, palps, severe SOB, focal neuro, or prolonged LOC → call 000/ED  
- Driving: discussed Austroads briefly. Single likely vasovagal event, no high‑risk features. Advised no driving 24–48h & until feels back to baseline. Reassess after results / if recurrent → consider further w/up + driving restrictions, poss cardiology/neurology.  

Asthma:  
- Start budesonide DPI 200 mcg 1 inh BD (low‑dose ICS) – PBS  
- Continue salbutamol pMDI 100 mcg 2–4 puffs via spacer PRN (up to q4h if needed) – PBS  
- Checked inhaler tech quickly in room  
- Verbal asthma plan only today (time) → if ↑ sx/waking/↑ SABA → ↑ budesonide to 2 inh BD short term + review. Red flags (can’t speak, severe SOB, cyanosis, feeling faint) → 000 + salb 4–8 puffs via spacer q4min until amb.  
- Triggers: advised re classroom dust, talk to school re cleaning/renos exposure  

F/up:  
- Review 1/52: check bloods, any further dizzy spells, asthma control + ICS use, complete written asthma action plan, consider spirometry / resp referral if still poor.  
- Earlier PRN if recur collapse, CP, palps, severe SOB.  

Scripts today:  
- Budesonide 200 mcg DPI 1 inh BD x 1/12 + rpt  
- Salbutamol 100 mcg pMDI PRN + spacer advice  

Billing:  
- Level B, bulk billed.
