Reason for visit:  
Review asthma results + meds reveiw (bloods + spirom from last appt 03/09/25  — today’s review 22/11/25).  

S:  
42y F teacher, known asthma + GORD. Here to “go over those tests”.  
Asthma “up and down” few mnths. Using salbutamol most school days, often after playground duty, some days twice. Waking with tight chest / cough ~2–3 nights/wk. SOB + wheeze walking up hill to carpark, settles in few mins. No current acute flare, no CP, no fevers.  

Admits poor preventer use: “I keep forgetting the brown puffer, maybe couple of times a week if that”. Ran out a few weeks ago and did not refill. Missed last asthma reveiw due to work.  
Reflux “playing up” esp late meals + coffee, retrosternal burn ~3 nights/wk, helps a bit with OTC antacids. Has script for PPI from last visit but never started.  

No ED visits, no recent pred courses, never ICU. Non–smoker. Lives ~1hr from town, finds it hard to get back in term time.  

Meds (self report – some not taking):  
- Salbutamol pMDI 100mcg: 2–4 puffs PRN via spacer, most weekdays  
- Budesonide/formoterol DPI 200/6: was 1 inh BD, now essentially not using for several mnths  
- Esomeprazole 20mg mane – never commenced  

O:  
Gen: Well, talking in full sentances, NAD.  
Vitals: BP 122/76, HR 78 reg, RR 16, SpO2 98% RA, afebrile. BMI ~28 (est).  
Resp: Chest clear, no wheeze at rest, good AE, no inc WOB. CVS: dual sounds, no added. Abd soft, NT, no epigastric T.  

Ix reviewed (QML – done last visit, results now):  
Spirometry pre/post BD:  
- FEV1 78% pred pre, 90% pred post (sig reversibility)  
- FEV1/FVC mildly ↓, c/w asthma, partial control.  
Bloods: FBC, UEC, LFT, CRP all WNL, no eosinophillia.  

A:  
1. Asthma – chronic, suboptiimally controlled, preventer non‑adherance. Frequent SABA, nocturnal sx 2–3x/wk, spirometry with reversible obstruction. No acute exaccerbation today.  
2. GORD – symptomatic, untreated (non‑start of PPI). Likely contrib to nocturnal cough/tightness.  
3. Adherance / access issues (work + distance to clinic).  

P:  
Asthma:  
- Explained spirom + bloods, advised asthma not well controlled.  
- Re‑start preventer:  
  • Budesonide/formoterol DPI 200/6: 1 inh BD, rinse mouth.  
  • Use as MART for symptom relief as per written instuctions given (max daily dose discussed – will re‑check next reveiw).  
- Continue salbutamol 100mcg pMDI via spacer 2 puffs PRN, up to 6 puffs; if needing >6 puffs in 1 hr or freq doses with no improv → seek urgent care/ED.  
- Checked inhaler technique with spacer – initially poor breath‑hold, corrected and pt able to demonstate.  
- Brief written asthma action plan provided (green/yellow/red zones); more detailed school copy next longer appt.  
- Strategies for remembering preventer: link to brushing teeth, phone alarms, consider 2 preventers (home/school) when filling PBS script.  
- No oral steroids, no need resp referall yet – will reconsider if still poor control after ~3/12 with good adherance.  

GORD:  
- Start esomeprazole 20mg mane, 30mins before breakfast, trial 4–8/52.  
- Basic lifestyle advice re late meals, coffee, alcohol, lying flat etc (discussed).  

Follow‑up / systems:  
- Telehealth reveiw in 4/52 (after school hours) to check asthma control + PPI response.  
- F2F asthma reveiw + repeat spirometry ~3/12 (or earlier if worse).  
- Nurse asthma education (inhaler technique + action plan) – asked to book today; reception informed (pt says will “try to fit it in”).  

Safety net:  
- Attend ED / call 000 if inc SOB, difficulty speaking full sentances, cyanosis, exhaustion, or needing reliever >6–10 puffs in 1 hr / every 3–4 hrs with no improv.
