42F new pt walk-in  

CC: HA x4/7 + ongoing pleuritic CP  

HPC  
HA: gradual onset, bifrontal/temporal, dull ± sharp twinges 5–7/10 worse PM + screens. Some relief Panadol. No mig hx. Not thunderclap, not “worst ever”.  
No red flag sx: no focal neuro, no visual loss, no speech change, no collapse, no sz, no fever/neck stiffness/photophobia, no rash, no AM vomiting. Mild nausea only. Sleep poor d/t chest pain + stress.  

Pleuritic CP: dx pleurisy at Wagga ED ~1/52 ago per pt. Says CTPA -ve PE “just inflammation”. No records yet.  
L sharp pleuritic pain ~10/7, worse deep insp/cough/laugh. Slightly ↓ since ED but still up to 6/10. Dry cough, no sputum, no haemoptysis. Mild DOE on hills, stable. No orthopnoea/PND/oedema. Non-smoker. Known CTD (“mixed connective tissue disease”) on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg mane. No steroids currently.

O/E  
Obs: BP 118/76 HR 92 reg RR 18 Temp 36.8 SpO₂ 98% RA BMI ~27  
Gen: alert, NAD, mildly anxious

CVS: HS dual, no added, no oedema  

Impression  
1) HA – likely tension-type ± stress/sleep-related. No red flags today, neuro exam N, low suspicion SAH/meningitis/space-occupying lesion/CVT  
2) Pleuritic CP – known recent pleurisy in CTD pt, haemodynamically stable, low suspicion PE/Pnx/PNA today but persisting sx → re-image  
3) CTD on HCQ – needs ongoing GP/rheum f/up  
4) Multiple other non-urgent issues – defer (time)  

Ix  
CXR PA+lat – pleura/lung fields, ?effusion/infiltrate/Pnx  
FBC, CRP, ESR, U&E, LFT – infection/inflam + baseline pre-NSAID + CTD monitoring  
Request Wagga ED notes/CTPA via fax/HealthLink – reception to chase  

Plan  
HA  
- Reassured no current red flags explained – ED if sudden severe “worst ever”, neuro deficit, confusion, recurrent vomiting, fever + neck stiffness, visual loss etc  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24 h)  
  • Start ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food 3–5/7 if tolerates – discussed short course, stop if GI upset/black stool/SOB/rash  

Pleurisy / CP  
- Emphasised adequate analgesia → avoid shallow breathing  
- As above start NSAID + Panadol  
- Deep breathing encouraged  
- Safety net: ED if ↑SOB, sudden severe CP, unilateral leg swelling, haemoptysis, fever/rigors, collapse  

CTD  
- Continue HCQ 200 mg mane (pending confirmation from records)  
- Needs reg bloods + eye checks – to organise once records back + in longer appt  
- Will consider rheum re-referral once more info  

Other concerns (shoulder, GORD sx, mole, fatigue, wt/hormones)  
- Deferred – advised need longer booked consult, not addressed today  

F/up  
- Review 3–5/7 with this clinic: check HA + CP, review CXR + bloods, start working through chronic issues if time  
- ED earlier if any red flag HA or acute CP/SOB as above
