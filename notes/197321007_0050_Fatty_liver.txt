Reason for visit  
R/V abnormal LFTs jaundice low albumin ↑INR  

S  
54yo Anglo-Aust male truckie  
Known NAFLD metabolic syndrome HTN dyslipidaemia hyperferritinaemia  

Here for planned R/V bloods from last wk  
Wife had noticed yellow eyes 2–3/52  
Pt: "pathology lady said my clotting was off and albumin low should I be worried"  
Mild itch forearms nil dark urine nil pale stool  
Nil fevers rigors NS  
Appetite abit ↓ but still eating reg meals nil wt loss (wt creeping up over yrs)  
Nil RUQ pain nil N/V nil haematemesis bowels OK nil PR bleed or melaena  
Nil confusion personality change sleep-wake ok still driving long haul nil near misses "not zoning out"  
Mild ankle swelling evenings last few mths not painful  

Alcohol prev 3–4 beers most nights ↓ over last yr to couple on wkend after fatty liver dx denies binges nil spirits  
Abx amoxycillin/clavulanate for sinus ~6/52 ago feels "yellow started after those antibiotics could that have done it"  
Nil herbal or gym supplements nil illicit drugs  

Past fatty liver dx ~4yrs ago on USS for mildly ↑ LFTs last R/V ~18/12 ago steatosis only no cirrhosis documented then  
Hyperferritinaemia known several yrs prev workup non‑HFE per old spec letter ferritin last yr ~700 now 750

New synthetic dysfunction vs prior results 18/12 ago where albumin 38 INR 1.1 bili 16 (per old EMR)  

A  
1 Suspected progression NAFLD → advanced fibrosis / early cirrhosis with impaired synthetic fn  
   Jaundice hypoalbuminaemia ↑INR thrombocytopenia low‑normal but stable haemodynamically nil encephalopathy nil GI bleed currently  
2 Metabolic syndrome contributing to liver dx BP lipids suboptimal glycaemia borderline  
3 Hyperferritinaemia likely metabolic but needs up to date iron studies confirm HFE genotype  
4 Occupational driving heavy vehicles currently fit to drive no encephalopathy but may change pending spec review  

P  
1 Ix ordered today  
   - LFTs INR/PT APTT albumin  
   - FBC UEC CMP  
   - Viral hep screen HBsAg anti‑HBs anti‑HBc HCV Ab  
   - Autoimmune liver screen ANA SMA LKM AMA IgG  
   - Coeliac serology  
   - Iron studies ferritin  
   - AFP baseline  
   - Request copy prev HFE genotype from hospital / spec  
   - Urgent liver USS with Doppler within 1/52 assess liver texture nodularity portal vein patency ascites biliary tree  

2 Referrals  
   - Urgent hepatology/gastro ref public (Wagga Wagga Base / nearest tertiary)  
     Indication new synthetic dysfunction on background NAFLD ↑bili INR 1.6 albumin 29  
     For FibroScan ± biopsy variceal + HCC screening transplant risk stratification etc  

3 Meds  
   - Continue perindopril metformin  
   - Continue atorvastatin for now evidence OK in NAFLD defer to hepatology if marked LFT ↑  
   - Avoid NSAIDs  
   - Paracetamol max 2g/24h PRN  
   - Strict abstinence alcohol from now pt agrees "if that helps the liver I’ll knock it off completely"  
   - Advise nil OTC herbal liver detox products  

4 Counselling / safety net  
   Explained liver making less clotting factors and protein hence urgent spec input  
   Red flags → ED immediately  
   - Confusion drowsiness "feeling spaced out"  
   - Haematemesis black stools  
   - Rapid abdo swelling severe abdo pain  
   - Fever >38.5C with worsening jaundice or rigors  
   Advised not to drive if feels confused very tired or generally crook esp in truck  

5 Lifestyle brief today  
   - Discussed role of wt loss 7–10% over 12/12 in NAFLD  
   - Suggested Mediterranean style pattern practical swaps for roadhouse food avoid sugary drinks energy drinks  
   - Encourage walking on days off light exercise  
   - Coffee 2–3 cups/day OK  

6 Work / driving  
   Currently no encephalopathy appears safe to continue commercial driving  
   Advised may need review of fitness to drive depending on hepatology findings and if mental state changes  

7 Pt questions  
   - "Is this reversible or is the damage done" discussed fat/inflammation can improve fibrosis less reversible aim to stop progression prevent complications  
   - Will review any new meds from hepatology monitor bloods  

F/U  
- R/V 1/52 to go through repeat bloods + USS if back confirm hepatology appt start more detailed metabolic CV risk plan  
- Earlier R/V or ED if red flags or feels signif worse  

Time  
Std 15min consult focus liver results urgent workup other chronic issues incl ?OSA left for longer appt later
