54M  

CC: “bit depressed” + long list of other issues – advised can only do 1–2 today → agreed mood + “fatty liver/weight”. Others (shoulder, knee, scalp spot, toenail, BP, scripts) deferred  

HPC  
Low mood “few months, maybe longer” feels “flat and cranky” ↓enjoyment (grandkids, working dogs, fishing) still working farm but “pushing through”  
Sleep: wakes 2–3x ruminating re money/health → tired days  
↑snacking “more rubbish at night” wt up “a few kilos” last yr (no scales, est 115–118kg, 176cm → BMI ~37–38)  
No past psych dx no ADs no counselling  
No mania/psychosis  
Risk: occasional “what’s the point” but denies SI/plan “I’d never do anything, I’ve got the grandkids” no SH hx  

Thinks mood worsened after NAFLD dx “since they said my liver’s fatty I feel like I’m falling apart” worried Coke Zero “poisoning my liver and brain” – reassured  

NAFLD / metabolic  
US 2023: mod steatosis (per pt)  
Prev bloods mid‑23 “liver a bit high, sugars borderline, cholesterol not great” no results today  
Diet: high refined carbs, big portions, takeaway  
Drinks 2–3 cans Coke Zero/d, 2–3 coffees w sugar  
EtOH: 3–4 full strength beers 5–6 nights/wk, more in footy season – disc contrib to liver + mood  
Hx “borderline BP”, “pre‑diabetes”, stopped BP meds himself “couple of years ago”  

MSE (video)  
Looks overweight, cooperative, tangential with list  
Mood “flat, worn out” affect congruent  
No psychosis, no SI/HI, cognition grossly ok  

Screen  
PHQ‑9 ~13 → mod depn

Plan  
– Start sertraline 25mg mane 7/7 then ↑50mg mane if tol  
   SEs, onset 2–4/52, adherence discussed  
   Caution EtOH + machinery first wk  
– Better Access psych – refer (telehealth capable local/regional)  
– Basic sleep hygiene + activity (briefly discussed)  

NAFLD / metabolic / EtOH  
– Explained NAFLD + wt loss 7–10% helps  
– Advise ↓EtOH → aim ≤1–2 std drinks ≤3 nights/wk + alcohol‑free days; pt: “I thought beer didn’t count much” now willing to try cut back / mid‑strength  
– Brief diet chat (↓processed, ↓evening snacks, Coke Zero ok but swap some to water)  
– Encourage cont farm work + extra walking as able  

Ix – to local path (fasting)  
– FBC, U&E, LFT  
– Fasting glucose, HbA1c  
– Lipids incl TG  
– Ferritin, iron studies  
– HBsAg, HCV Ab  
Plan to calc FIB‑4 / NAFLD fibrosis score when results + any old LFTs available  

CV risk  
– Needs proper BP + wt → ask pt to get BP/wt at chemist or in‑person 1–2/52  
– Once bloods + vitals back → calc absolute CVD risk, consider statin / restart BP meds if indicated  

Other probs (not done today – time)  
– R shoulder, knee pain, scalp lesion, thickened toenail, BP review, scripts → book long F2F 2–3/52 (when bloods back) for exam + full CVD/NAFLD review  

Safety / f/up  
– Suicide risk low today; advised ED/000 if acute SI / can’t cope  
– Review 2/52 TH re mood, sertraline, path results if back  
– Long F2F 2–3/52 for physical + remaining issues  

RTC earlier if worse, SEs, mood deteriorates
