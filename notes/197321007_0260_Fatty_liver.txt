52M f/up fatty liver + results  

Hx  
Known fatty liver ~18/12. Here to "go through every single result". Very anxious re cirrhosis/cancer "up half the night googling". Reassurance seeking ++ "are you 100% sure it's not cancer".  
No abdo pain, N/V, jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, wt loss, GI bleed, confusion. Energy ok, a bit tired (OT + worry).  
Alcohol: Fri/Sat ~6–8 std drinks total (some nights maybe more), nil midweek.  
Diet: high takeaway, ↑snacks, now more diet soft drink (worried artificial sweeteners "poisoning liver"). Minimal exercise.  

Ex  
BP 132/84 HR 76 afeb SpO₂ 99% RA BMI 31  
Abdo soft NT. No stigmata CLD.  

Ix (last wk, compared to 18/12 ago where mildly ↑ only – similar pattern)  
LFT: ALT 56 (sl ↑, similar), AST 42 (borderline), GGT 68 (mild ↑), ALP 85 N, bili 9 N, alb 42 N → synthetic fn intact  
FBC, U&E N  
Lipids: TC 5.5 LDL 3.3 HDL 0.9↓ TG 2.1↑  
Fasting glu 5.9 (pre‑DM range), HbA1c 5.7%  
Hep B sAg -ve, Hep C Ab -ve, ferritin/iron N  
Abdo USS: mod hepatic steatosis, ↑echogenicity, no focal lesion, PV N, no spleno, no ascites. Report: no e/o cirrhosis or mass.  

FIB-4 today (AST 42 ALT 56 Plt N ~250 age 52) → low risk <1.3  

Impr  
1) NAFLD – mod steatosis, mild transam ↑, low FIB-4, USS N re cirrhosis/mass  
2) Overweight/obesity (BMI 31) + early metabolic risk (low HDL, ↑TG, borderline glu)  
3) Health anxiety re liver/cancer – reassurance seeking, heavy Dr Google  

Plan  
- Explained results briefly → fatty liver, no current e/o cirrhosis or Ca, low fibrosis risk, GP f/up appropriate. Discussed that cannot be 100% but current tests very reassuring, no red flags → no CT/MRI/biopsy indicated now.  
- Lifestyle focus:  
  • Wt loss target ~7–10% over 12/12  
  • ↓takeaway, portion control, limit sugary drinks (ok to have diet in moderation)  
  • Encourage ↑exercise (aim 150 min/wk mod + some resistance) – start with brisk walks  
- Alcohol: adv <10 std/wk and <4/occasion; asked to cut wkend intake ~3–4 drinks and trial AFDs.  
- Reassured coffee 2–3/day ok.  
- Referral to APD done today (pt agreeable). Consider CDM plan next visit if ongoing needs.  
- Repeat LFTs, FBC, lipids, fasting glu/HbA1c in 6/12. Recalc FIB-4 in ~2 yrs or earlier if LFTs ↑ or sx.  
- No hepatology ref now – discussed criteria (worsening LFTs, ↑fibrosis score, synthetic dysfn, USS abn, wt loss, jaundice etc).  
- Acknowledged anxiety, offered separate appt to discuss anxiety/psychology if persists; pt wants to "see how I go".  

F/up  
- Review 3/12 – check wt, alcohol, anxiety; plan CV risk assessment + heartburn/snoring then if time.  
- Earlier if jaundice, RUQ pain, wt loss, vomiting, melaena/PR bleed, confusion, ↑fatigue/unwell.
