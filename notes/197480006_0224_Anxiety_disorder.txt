22/11/25 RACF round  
Seen in own room limited privacy nil family present  

# Reason for r/v  
– Script repeat for anxiety meds  
– Reassurance re gen health pt worried meds "might be masking something serious" and "dont want to miss cancer"  

# HPI  
84yo F Anglo background retired admin now RACF resident known GAD MDD dementia (mild–mod) reg pt  

Says due for repeat of her "nerve tablets" ie sertraline  
Feels "more on edge the last few weeks" worries "about everything" esp memory and "what if its my heart or cancer"  
Lots of qs about chest sx being "early cancer" or "heart attack"  
Has been googling on daughters iPad "it said chest tightness at my age is usually cancer or a heart problem"  

Anxiety  
– Excessive worry most days worse evenings overnight  
– Sleep takes longer to get off wakes 1–2x/nt with worry settles after staff reassurance nil nightmares  
– Somatic sx intermittent mild chest tightness + fluttering when anxious lasts mins settles with slow breathing staff presence nil clear exertional comp nil radiation nil diaphoresis nil N/V nil collapse  
   Similar pattern for yrs prev normal ECG + cardiology r/v in file ~5yrs ago nil IHD dx  
– Mood "abit low some days" still enjoys chats TV nil anhedonia for all activities  
– SI nil today "I wouldnt do that to the kids"  
– Cogn aware of decline "losing words more often" worried "im going downhill real fast" staff report nil acute stepwise change  

Health anxious behaviours  
– Repeated requests to nursing staff past wk to check BP pulse "in case Im having a heart attack"  
– Some tangential ideas eg "water here smells a bit funny maybe thats affecting my nerves" "extra cup of tea at night maybe not good for my heart"  

RACF RN verbal  
– Nil acute behavioural change nil falls  
– Short self limiting anxiety episodes managed with reassurance  
– Eating drinking ok  
– Nil recent infections nil new meds  

Past psych  
– GAD long standing ↑ after move to RACF 2yrs ago  
– MDD stable >12/12 on sertaline mirtazapine nil past attempts recorded  
– Dementia likely Alz mild–mod needs assist with IADLs supervision meds/finances orientated person place date variable  

PMHx (abridged)  
– HTN  
– Hyperlipidaemia  
– OA knees spine  
– Nil known IHD prior normal stress test ~5yrs ago  
– Nil DM  

Meds (per chart + RN pt partial recall)  
– Sertraline 50mg mane  
– Mirtazapine 15mg nocte  
– Perindopril 5mg mane  
– Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
– Paracetamol 1g TDS PRN  
– Vit D  
Nil reg benzos nil ETOH nil OTC stimulants  

Allergies  
– NKDA  

Social brief  
Widowed 2 adult kids daughter EPOA visits weekly supportive  
Previously very independent high premorbid function now limited to facility so access to external psych tricky  

# Exam  
Gen elderly lady neatly dressed mildly anxious cooperative engaging repetitive qs  
Obs today from RACF BP 136/72 HR 78 reg RR 16 SpO2 98% RA afebrile BSL not done today nil DM hx  
CVS HS dual nil m/r JVP not elevated nil oedema  
Resp clear good AE  
Neuro/cog alert orientated person place unsure exact date "November sometime" speech coherant nil focal deficit on brief screen  

MSE  
Appearance behav pleasant anxious frequent reassurance seeking  
Mood "abit worried all the time" affect anxious reactive  
Thought content prominent health worries catastrophic interp of benign sx nil delusions nil halucinations SI nil  
Thought form mostly linear some tangential but returns to health worries  
Insight partial recognises anx but concerned "something serious could be missed"  
Judgement fair for simple decisions  

# Assessment (registrar)  
1 GAD chronic currently mild–mod likely exacerbated by health anxiety dementia related uncertainty + online health info  
   – No red flags for acute organic cause of anx today obs and exam reassuring  
2 MDD in partial remission mood fairly stable on current regimen but age + dementia ↑risk of relapse so needs monitoring  
3 Dementia mild–mod appears clinically stable today contributes to misinterpretation of bodily sensations + reliance on reassurance  
4 Somatic health anxiety frequent reassurance seeking pattern long standing  
5 Chest tightness appears anx related brief non exertional unchanged pattern prev normal cardiac workup low suspicion ACS today though aware age and RFs mean ongoing vigilance needed  

Differentails considered  
– ACS/angina less likely given non exertional short lived sx normal obs exam prev neg tests  
– Arrhythmia less likely HR reg nil palps on exam  
– PE unlikely nil SOB pleuritic pain risk factors  
– Infection metabolic cause of ↑anx nil sx today  

# Plan  
Time limited consult ~15min focus script + anx r/v explained unable to investigate every transient sx prioritised main concerns  

1 GAD / MDD  
– Continue sertraline 50mg mane chart updated script done chose not to ↑dose today as overall functioning reasonable and sudden change may ↑confusion/anx in context dementia  
– Continue mirtazapine 15mg nocte  
– Psychoeducation  
   • Discussed link between anx and physical sx eg chest tightness palps  
   • Normalised some worry re health but gently pointed out catastrophic pattern  
   • Reassured exam obs today not suggestive of MI or malignancy explained that if pattern of sx changed we would rethink  
– Boundaries around Ix  
   • Explained further routine tests eg repeat ECG bloods scans in absence of new features unlikely to help and may feed health anx  
   • Emphasised focus on monitoring change rather than repeat testing  
– Non pharm  
   • Revised slow breathing grounding techniques left brief cue card via RN "Slow breaths talk to staff symptoms usually pass in a few minutes"  
   • Asked RN to encourage participation in enjoyable activities TV room group sessions to ↓rumination  
– Psych input  
   • Formal CBT likely helpful but access limited in RACF  
   • Plan to discuss possible telehealth psych with daughter at next family meeting ?MHCP then  

2 Monitoring safety  
– Safety net to pt and RN  
   • Seek urgent help / call ambulance if chest pain prolonged >20min or clearly exertional or assoc radiation SOB diaphoresis N/V or collapse  
   • R/V earlier if mood ↓ significantly new SI or acute change in behaviour cognition  
– Asked RACF to monitor night time distress agitation if ↑ or unmanageable will need med r/v consider adjust antidepressant vs short term PRN strategy (avoid reg benzos if possible)  

3 Dementia  
– Appears stable today nil acute change  
– Reassured that word finding diff and mild forgetfulness fit known dementia rather than new severe illness  
– Plan longer cognition/function r/v with daughter present next 4–6/52 RN to help organise (likely extended appt)  

4 Tangential concerns  
– Water "smelling funny" reassured RACF supply treated safe sx pattern not suggestive of water issue  
– Extra evening tea explained caffeine can ↑jitters affect sleep suggested limit caffeinated tea after ~4pm offer decaf/herbal in evening RN aware  

5 Ix  
– Nil new Ix ordered today given stable pattern reassuring exam and wish not to reinforce health anx  
– Will consider routine annual bloods FBC U&E LFT TFT B12 folate lipids at next scheduled med r/v rather than now  

6 F/U  
– Routine RACF GP r/v 4–6/52 earlier PRN if ↑anx new physical sx or concerns from staff/family  
– Plan extended family r/v with daughter/EPOA in 1–2/12 to discuss broader mgmt of anx depn dementia and potential telehealth psych referral  

Pt understanding  
Pt verbalised understanding but repeatedly asked "are you sure we dont need more tests I just dont want to miss something like cancer"  
Reiterated reasoning + safety netting appeared somewhat reassured though expect ongoing intermittent reassurance seeking RN aware  

Registrar learning points  
– Challenging balance between validating health concerns vs not reinforcing health anxiety esp in dementia  
– Uncertain if should have ordered baseline bloods today for reassurance vs risk of feeding pattern discussed with supervisor below  

[Supervisor addendum 22/11/25 16:10]  
Discussed case with registrar  
Agree overall dx GAD with health anxiety on background mild–mod dementia and MDD in partial remission  
Agree low suspicion ACS or other acute pathology today so reasonable to avoid further Ix at this stage safety net appropriate  
Support decision to continue current sertaline and mirtazapine doses nil change today  
Telehealth psych via MHCP worth exploring with daughter at planned family r/v
