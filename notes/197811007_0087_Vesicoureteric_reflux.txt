Dx  
1) Contact dermatitis ?irritant/?allergic likely new detergent / heat + sweat / scrubs  
   No red flag features for SJS/TEN, cellulitis, anaphylaxis  
2) Hx VUR childhood – currently asymptomatic, normal dip today, renal status unknown (no recent UEC/eGFR/USS on file)  

Plan  
1) Rash  
→ Avoid new detergent; advise re‑wash close contact clothes/bedding with previous or soap‑free product  
→ Loose cotton, avoid tight sleeves  
→ Rx hydrocortisone 1% cream thin layer BD to affected areas ≤7/7 then PRN (PBS)  
→ Emollient (e.g. sorbolene) TDS esp post‑shower, avoid hot showers/harsh soaps (briefly discussed)  
→ Non‑sedating antihistamine PRN itch (cetirizine 10 mg mane, OTC)  
→ RTC if ↑rash, systemic sx, facial/tongue swell, SOB, blistering etc  

2) VUR / renal f/up  
Currently well, urine dip clear, no UTI sx  
Needs baseline adult review  
→ Book long appt 2–4/52 for full renal hx + exam  
   Plan then: UEC/eGFR, urine ACR, BP trend, consider renal USS if no prior results obtained  
→ Asked to bring old hosp letters/USS reports  
→ Advised early review if UTI sx develop; avoid excess NSAIDs when dehydrated
