Plan  
Rash  
- Hydrocortisone 1% cream bd thinly to affected areas x 5–7/7 then PRN short courses. PBS OTC – advised small tube.  
- Emollient: non-fragranced moisturiser (e.g. sorbolene) bd.  
- Avoid triggers as able: change to sensitive laundry liquid / soap-free wash, avoid hot showers + scented products where poss.  
- Cetirizine 10mg nocte PRN itch esp if sleep disturbed – pt reluctant re tabs but agrees PRN.  
- RTC/ED if rapid spread, blistering, facial/tongue swelling, SOB, fever, skin hot/painful/weepy.  

Fructose malabsorption / bowels  
- Link explained: ↑ high-FODMAP/↑fructose intake → current sx. No IBD/coeliac red flags today.  
- Brief diet advice: ↓ apples/pears/fruit juice/dried fruit/honey/“fruit” muesli bars. Use low-FODMAP fruit small serves, simple low-FODMAP staples (rice, oats, potato, eggs, tinned tuna etc).  
- No ix today – defer FBE/CRP/coeliac/LFT/U&E unless sx persist/worsen or red flags (PR blood, noct diarrhoea, wt loss, fever, severe pain). Pt prefers to hold off – documented.  
- Mentioned dietitian / Monash FODMAP app – cost/time barrier, will self-manage for now.
