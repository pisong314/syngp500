CC: “feeling really low”, skin spots  

HPI  
Low mood ~2–3/12. “Down in the dumps”, ↓motivation, ↓interest (gardening/RSL). Early AM waking 0400–0500, no probs getting off to sleep. ↓appetite, ?2–3kg wt loss per pt. Low energy, poor conc “keep losing my train of thought”.  
No prev dx/txt depression/anxiety. No recent bereavement. Stopped driving after minor bingle → feels “useless”, more housebound. ETOH ~2–3 beers most nights, more some w/ends. No illicit.  
Denies active SI/plan. Some passive thoughts “wouldn’t matter if I didn’t wake up” but says “I wouldn’t do anything silly, I’ve got the grandkids”.  
Very directive re mgmt – wants “strong antidepressant that fixes it in a week”, wants “brain scan” to “check everything”. Explained not indicated (no focal signs, no red flags) – not entirely convinced.  

Skin – long hx sun exposure, “sunspots” scalp/face. Usual GP “freezes them every time”. Rough scaly spots scalp/temples “for ages”, mildly itchy, no bleeding/ulceration/rapid change. Past cryo ~12/12 ago. No hx melanoma known.  

PMHx  
“Sunspots” only per pt. No reg meds (to confirm from records). NKDA.  

Exam  
Obs: BP 132/76, HR 74 reg, RR 14, T 36.6, SpO₂ 98% RA. Looks well, NAD.  
MSE: Neatly dressed, good grooming. Mildly impatient, pushes for specific meds/investigations. Speech nl. Mood “flat/over it”, affect mildly constricted but reactive. TP linear. No psychosis. Passive death thoughts only, no active SI/plan. Cognition grossly intact, orientated. Insight/judgement fair.  
Skin (brief, face/scalp only): multiple erythematous rough scaly macules/papules 3–8mm over vertex scalp, frontal scalp, temples, upper forehead c/w AKs. No obvious ulceration/induration/horn lesions. Background marked solar damage. Not full skin check (time).  

Ix  
PHQ-9 = 14 (mod depression).  
Ordered: FBC, UEC, LFT, TSH, fasting BSL, lipids, B12/folate (baseline + r/o reversible causes, SSRI safety). No imaging.  

Dx  
1. Mod depressive episode – new, likely multifactorial (loss of licence/independence, isolation, chronic health concerns). Passive death thoughts only, no active SI.  
2. Multiple AKs scalp/face, field change solar damage.  
3. Mild ETOH use – may be contributing to mood/sleep.  

Plan  
Depression  
- Discussed dx + options (meds/psych/non-pharm) – pt strongly prefers meds, dismissive of “just talking”  
- Start sertraline 25mg mane 1/52 → then ↑ to 50mg mane if tol (PBS). SEs discussed (GI, sleep, transient ↑anxiety, sexual). Written info given.  
- Crisis/safety: advised ED/000 if SI/intent develops. No current SI/plan.  
- Encouraged routine, short walks, ↓ETOH (aim ≤1–2 std, some AFDs) – brief only.  
- Consider psychology / Better Access next review if pt agreeable (currently reluctant).  

Skin / AKs  
- Explained AKs, small SCC risk, need reg skin checks.  
- Pt requested immediate cryo “just freeze the lot like my usual doctor”. No time today (already over), need procedure slot + consent.  
- Plan: book short procedural appt next 2–3/52 for cryo to scalp/face AKs. At that visit assess any thicker/non-resolving lesions for possible bx.  
- Brief sun protection advice (SPF50+, hat etc).  
- Consider oral nicotinamide 500mg bd later if records confirm multiple NMSCs.  
- Full skin check 20–30 min appt suggested later (not today).  

Other  
- Pt also wanted knee MRI “to see what’s really going on” – deferred, advised separate appt (no time today).  
- Records requested from usual GP for skin hx + meds.  

F/U  
- Review 2/52: mood, sertraline tol, suicidality, bloods.  
- Nurse/GP cryo appt within 2–3/52.  
- Longer appt later for full skin check + knees/driving/social supports.  

Billing  
- Long consult (time >20 mins) – item 36, bulk billed today.
