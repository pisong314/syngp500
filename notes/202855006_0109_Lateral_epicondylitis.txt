Plan  
# R lateral epicondylitis  
Education re tendon overload vs “wear and tear” favourable prognosis  
Advised to avoid / modify tasks needing heavy gripping lifting w elbow ext forearm pronated eg heavy bags pouring full kettle steering wheel arm outstretched  
Encouraged using L hand more at checkout keeping loads closer to body  

Analgesia  
Trial short course regular NSAID during flare  
Ibuprofen 400mg TDS wf for up to 5–7/7 then PRN max 1200mg/day OTC  
Discussed GI renal CV risks long term high dose nil hx ulcers  
Also discussed topical NSAID eg Voltaren gel to lat elbow up to QID as alt or adjunct  
Suggested phone reminder link doses to meals due to forgetfullness  

Exercise  
Provided clinic handout simple home program eccentric / resisted wrist ext starting light elbow flexed progress as tol mild discomfort ok avoid strong pain  
Maintain general activity eg walking  

Allied health  
Re-discussed physio benefits for structured loading ergonomic advice  
Pt hesitant re time cost  
Given details local bulk billing / low cost physio service encouraged at least 1 off assessment though pt non commital  

Ix  
Nil ordered today dx clinical imaging unlikely to change mx at this stage  

# General health  
Briefly discussed BMI diet activity further screening bloods cervical screening etc  
Plan longer appt for full check fasting bloods when pt able  

Safety net  
Pt advised to r/v earlier or attend ED if  
– sudden ↑ pain after trauma  
– new swelling redness warmth locking  
– new weakness numbness or neck pain  
Generic advice also given to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain or confusion  
Otherwise RTC if worse or not improving  

Follow up  
R/V 4–6/52 re elbow sx adherence consider injection vs more formal physio if still signif symptomatic  
Suggested booking before leaving set phone reminder as pt tends to forget appts  
Separate long appt for full health check fasting bloods when convenient
