42M Wiradjuri – WH check / work clr + R shoulder pain  

R shoulder pain  
- 8–10/52, insidious, no single trauma  
- Ant R shoulder → down biceps, worse OH lifting / high shelves / heavy boxes away from body, lying R side  
- “Niggle” but wife says ↓lifting at home + poor sleep  
- Dominant R arm, WH storeperson/forklift  
- No neck pain, no paraesthesia, no true weak, no red flag sx  

O/E (focus only)  
- No deformity / swell  
- TTP bicipital groove R  
- AROM almost full but pain end-range flex/abd  
- Power RC 5/5, pain ant only  
- Speed +ve, Yergason +ve (pain only)  
- Cervical ROM N, Spurling -ve, neuro UL N  

Impression  
1) R biceps tendinopathy / overuse from WH work  
2) Work impact – OH/manual handling risk ongoing  

Mx  
- Activity mod: avoid/reduce repetitive OH + heavy lifts R arm 2–4/52, use forklift/trolley, light duties letter given  
- Analgesia: advised PCM 1g QID PRN; ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN short term with food (no known GI/renal issues). No opioids  
- Physio: ref to community physio (shoulder rehab, strengthening). Pt a bit reluctant but agreed if not settling  
- Ix: no imaging now – consider R shoulder USS if no better 6–8/52 or worse  

No routine bloods ordered today (pt keen to leave, declined full check)  

Safety net: RTC earlier if ↑pain, trauma, can’t lift arm, swell/red, fever, neuro sx  

F/up 3–4/52 review pain + function, consider imaging / steroid inj if ongoing despite physio/activity mod
