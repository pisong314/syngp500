New pt, 47yo M, police officer, walk-in. C/o “pain in the front‑inside bit of my heel” L side.  

Hx – about 3–4 wks L heel pain, anteromedial calcaneus, “like standing on a stone” esp first steps in morning + after long sitting in patrol car. Eases after 10–15 mins walking then dull ache by end of shift. Worse long shifts / foot patrol / heavy boots. No specific injury. No redness/swelling, no Achilles pain, no neuro sx. No systemic sx.  

No known PMHx, no meds, NKDA. Non-smoker.  

Exam (focused):  
VSS, afebrile. Walks with mild antalgic gait initially, improves quickly.  
L heel – focal TTP anteromedial calcaneal tuberosity / plantar fascia origin. No Achilles or posterior heel tenderness, no swelling/erythema. Windlass reproduces pain. Squeeze calcaneus NT. NV intact.  

Imp:  
? Plantar fasciitis L (“policeman’s heel”) – typical hx + exam. Overweight + prolonged standing on hard surfaces in boots. No red flags for #, infection, inflammatory cause.  

Plan (brief – time limited, lots of tangents):  
- Dx and course explained, reassurance.  
- Footwear: advised supportive runners/insoles, avoid barefoot on hard floors / flat thongs.  
- Simple stretches for calf + plantar fascia discussed (offered handout next visit).  
- Ice to heel after shifts if sore.  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN.  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food for 5–7 days for flare if needed, avoid ongoing long term. No script required (OTC).  
- No imaging at this stage – clinical dx, X‑ray unlikely to change mgmt.  

Work: suggested he consider modified duties if standing still for long periods aggravating – pt declined cert today.  

F/U 4–6/52 or earlier if worsening, inability to WB, swelling/redness or systemic sx.  

Bulk billed.  

10:24 – pt again asking re “heel spur like my mate had on X‑ray” – reiterated spur not necessarily source of pain, continue conservative measures first.
