Plan  

# Viral URTI / fever  
Reassured likely self limiting viral illness expected course ~5–7/7

– Or if SOB CP worsening cough confusion severe headache neck stiffness new urinary sx or feels “significantly more crook or not right”  
– RTC if sx not settling by ~7–10/7  

# Plantar fasciitis R heel

Analgesia  
– Continue paracetamol PRN  
– Short course NSAID eg ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food up to 5/7 discussed no known contraindications pt prefers to hold off for now will consider if pain ↑
