Ix today  
Urine dip: SG 1.015 pH 6 nitrites -ve leuc -ve blood -ve  
MSU sent M/C/S – pending  

Prev bloods (18/12 ago): FBC/U&E/LFT/CRP/coeliac all N  

Impr  
1) IBS-type picture in context fibro – alternating bowel habit, pain ↓ with defecation, no red flags  
2) Irritable bladder / ?OAB – freq + urgency, dip -ve, fibro-associated bladder hypersensitivity likely if MSU clear  
3) Fibromyalgia – stable-mod control on low-dose ami  
4) Depression – stable on sertraline, no SI  

Plan  
1) Bowels / IBS  
   – Reassure: no alarm features currently  
   – Trial ↑ soluble fibre (psyllium) slowly  
   – Encourage fluids, ↓ fizzy drinks  
   – Macrogol (Movicol) PRN if no BM >48h  
   – Hyoscine butylbromide 10 mg up to QID PRN cramps – warn may ↑ sedation with ami, first dose at home  

2) Bladder  
   – Await MSU; treat if UTI  
   – Bladder diary 3–4d  
   – ↓ caffeine / carbonated / acidic drinks  
   – Timed voiding, gradually ↑ interval  

3) Fibro  
   – Cont amitriptyline 20 mg nocte + walking program  
   – Flag: may ↑ ami later (10 mg steps up to max 50 mg nocte) or consider duloxetine/gabapentinoid – to discuss properly at long appt  

4) Depression  
   – Cont sertraline 100 mg mane  
   – Formal mood review (PHQ-9/DASS) next long appt  

F/U  
– Book long review 3–4/52: IBS/OAB sx + diaries + MSU result + fibro/meds review  
– RTC/ED earlier if PR bleeding, persistent severe pain, vomiting, wt loss, fever, new urinary pain/fever etc  

Pt understands plan, keen to “try the diary and see what sets it off”
