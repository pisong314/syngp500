22/11/25 AH GP clinic Bris – new pt

27M h/o TGA repair neonate (“arteries switched”) poor f/up

CC: “need a script + check-up, been getting a bit puffed”

HPI  
≈3–4/52 SOB on exertion only – stairs, rushing for bus  
Describes “puffed, chest tight” not true pain, no radiation, no pleuritic sx  
No syncope, a few brief light-headed episodes on standing  
No palps at rest, HR ↑ with fast walking  
No orthopnoea/PND/oedema, no recent viral, no fever/cough/sputum  
No DVT/PE RFs, non-smoker, no drugs  
High caffeine – 2–3 energy drinks/d + coffee  
Lost to ACHD clinic, last review ~2–3 yrs ago  
Previously on “beta-blocker + something” as teen, self-ceased, no current cardiac meds  
Also asking for repeat of “white heart rhythm tablet” – name/dose unknown, no box, no records  
Admits poor adherence “keep forgetting”

Allergies: NKDA

Obs  
BP 112/70 HR 92 reg RR 16 T 36.8 SpO₂ 96% RA

Exam (targeted)  
Gen: NAD, speaking full sentences, no SOB at rest, pink, no obvious cyanosis  
CVS: HS dual, soft systolic ej murmur LUSB 2/6, JVP not ↑, no oedema, pulses reg =  
Resp: CTAB good AE  
Abdo: soft NT

ECG (clinic 12L)  
SR 88, RAD, non-specific IVCD, no acute ischaemic changes  
Likely post-TGA repair pattern – no prior ECG to compare

Ix  
Limited after-hours  
ECG done as above  
For usual GP / ACHD: FBC, UEC, LFT, TFT, lipids, HbA1c, ±NT-proBNP – to be done via QML/SNP (not done tonight)  
Echo to be arranged via ACHD (not ordered directly here)

Dx / Impression  
1) Repaired TGA – complex CHD, now adult, poor f/up, no current cardiac meds  
2) Intermittent exertional SOB + chest tightness in adult with repaired TGA  
   – ?arrhythmia/conduction issue  
   – ?ventricular dysfunction / early HF  
   – ?deconditioning  
   – ACS unlikely (age, hx, ECG) but needs ACHD review  
Currently stable, no red flags at rest  
3) Med non-adherence / lost to specialist care – ↑ risk given CHD  
4) High caffeine intake – poss contributing to palps/light-headedness

Plan  
– Do NOT restart/commence cardiac meds today: previous regimen unknown, complex anatomy, no notes  
  (no beta-blocker/ACEi/anti-arrhythmic until ACHD advice)  
– No scripts given for “heart tablet” – explained unsafe without knowing drug/dose  

– Safety net (brief): ED if ↑ SOB, new/worse chest pain esp at rest, syncope/near-syncope, rapid sustained palps, new oedema, cyanosis  

– Caffeine: advise ↓ energy drinks → max 1 caffeinated drink/d until reviewed, avoid OTC stimulants  

– Referral: urgent ACHD cardiology at tertiary hosp (pt thinks [Hospital X])  
  Letter done today via HealthLink + printed copy – “urgent: symptomatic exertional dyspnoea, repaired TGA, off meds, lost to f/up”  
  Asked to call Mon to book appt  

– F/up GP: needs regular GP review 3–5/7 to organise bloods (QML/SNP forms to be done there), confirm ACHD appt, reassess sx  
  ACHD review ideally 1–2/52  

RTC/ED sooner if any red flag as above
