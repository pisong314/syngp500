Reason for visit: cough f/up (also Hirschsprung/constipation q’s)

24yo male, apprentice sparky. Known Hirschsprung s/p childhood surgery, on regular Movicol.

Cough  
- Ongoing ~2 wks, I saw him last week here – viral URTI dx then, no abx.  
- Still mainly dry cough, “bit of white gunk in the morning sometimes”. No blood.  
- Worse at night / on waking, wakes him a few times but goes back to sleep.  
- No SOB, no chest pain, no wheeze, no fever now. “Felt a bit hot first couple of days, all good now.”  
- Non-smoker, no vape, no ACEi. No asthma hx.  
- Thinks maybe “from the dust at work” + “house is a bit musty, old heater, smells no good”.  
- Still working, no exertional limitation.

Bowels / Hirschsprung  
- Longstanding post-surgical constipation, usually 1 stool/day or q2d on Movicol 1–2 sachets.  
- Last ~2 wks “a bit more backed up” – stool q2–3d, harder but still passing, no pain.  
- Denies abdo distension, severe cramps, vomiting, overflow diarrhoea, PR bleed.  
- Asking “Do I need to change anything with my laxatives when I get crook?”

Obs  
BP 118/72, HR 78, RR 16, T 36.7, SpO₂ 99% RA. Looks well, talking full sentences, occasional dry cough.  

Chest clear on ausc, good AE, no added sounds. Throat mildly red, nasal mucosa a bit boggy, otherwise unremarkable. Abd soft, non-distended, mild stooly feel LLQ only, non-tender.

Impression  
1) Subacute cough ~2/40 – likely post-viral ± mild upper airway irritation (dust, post-nasal drip). No red flags today, exam/vitals reassuring. No indication for CXR/abx at this stage.  
2) Hirschsprung disease with chronic constipation – currently reasonably controlled, mild slowing with recent illness, no features of obstruction/megacolon.  
3) Occupational/environmental irritants (dusty sites, old heater) probably contributing.

Plan  
- No abx.  
- Trial non-sedating antihistamine for possible post-nasal drip: cetirizine 10 mg nocte x 7–10 days (OTC, PBS if script but advised he can just buy it). Warned may cause some drowsiness – “see how you go with the first one before driving”.  
- Continue simple measures (lozenges, warm drinks, paracetamol PRN).  
- Strongly advised consistent mask use at dusty job sites; suggested landlord/agent get heater checked/cleaned.

Bowels:  
- OK to increase Movicol up to 2–3 sachets/day short term if >2 days no BM or stool hard, then reduce back to usual once back to daily soft stool.  
- Emphasised need to seek urgent care if new abdo distension, severe colicky pain, persistent vomiting, no wind/stool, or sudden watery “overflow” with pain/distension given Hirschsprung hx.

Investigations today: nil. Will order CXR ± spirometry if cough >4–6 wks or earlier if SOB, wheeze, haemoptysis, systemic symptoms.

Follow-up  
- Review with me or any GP in ~2 wks if cough not settling, sooner if worse / red flags.  
- Longer 20–30 min appt in 2–3 months to go through adult bowel management plan and consider gastro/colorectal referral + try to get old surgical notes.  
- Pt also wants “a general check-up and some bloods” – deferred today due to time, asked him to book separate routine check.

Pt able to repeat back red flag sx for both cough and bowel issues. Seems reliable with meds.

Billing: standard Level B, bulk billed. 09:28
