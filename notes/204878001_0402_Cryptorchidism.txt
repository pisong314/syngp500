Minor cut at work last wk now healed no sx “just freaked me out about tetanus”  
Googling “cryptorchidism and testicular cancer” “low immunity” “hormones from vaccines”  
Worried power tools / “all the electrical fields” → cancer “down there”  
No fever, no local sx, no systemic sx  
No testicular pain, lump, swelling, urinary sx, wt loss, NS, fatigue  
Hx R undescended testis → orchidopexy ~2yo per parents  
No hx intra‑abdo testis / orchidectomy

Repeatedly “are you sure there’s no lump?”  

A:  
1) Tetanus / vax review – up to date but >10y since last dTpa, ↑ occ exposure cuts at work + anxiety → reasonable booster  
2) Hx cryptorchidism s/p R orchidopexy – ↑ lifetime testis Ca risk but abs risk still low, exam today benign  
3) Health anxiety / reassurance seeking, heavy Dr Google use, impacting fxn (sleep / concn)  

P:  
1) Vax  
- dTpa (Boostrix) IM today L deltoid, consented, tol well  
- Flu vax discussed, pt “one thing at a time” → advised nurse appt later (AIR to be updated then)  
- Reassured no ↑ vax risk from hx cryptorchidism / hormones etc  

2) Cryptorchidism / Ca risk  
- Brief expl: prior UDT → ~2–4x rel risk but still low abs risk, orchidopexy helps detection not eliminate risk  
- Encouraged monthly self‑check, report new lump / pers ache / change size  
- Ordered scrotal USS bilat testes (incl Doppler if needed) mainly baseline + reassurance – non‑urgent  
- No tumour markers – not screening, asymptomatic, exam normal  

3) Health anxiety  
- Acknowl pattern Google → ↑ anxiety → repeated checks/tests  
- Suggested longer MH appt to discuss CBT / MHCP, pt “will think about it”  
- Book longer review 2–3/52 to go thru USS result + mental health if ready (20–30 min)
