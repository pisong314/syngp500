56F f/up SAH + “coming down with a cold”  

Hx  
– URTI sx x3/7: ST, blocked nose, mild dry cough, tired. No ear pain. No SOB/CP/wheeze. No N/V/D. Eating ↓ a bit, drinking ok. No documented fevers, “felt a bit hot but thermometer was normal”.  
– Using Panadol 1g bd prn + lozenges “takes the edge off”.  
– Worried re brain: “could this set something off in my head again?” “less oxygen to my brain?”  

– SAH: aneurysmal SAH 3/52 ago, coiled. ICU → ward. D/c ~10/7 ago. Nimodipine 21/7 course finished y/day. No antiplatelet/AC.  
– Now: occasional dull HA 2–3/10, settles w Panadol. No thunderclap HA. No visual change, speech probs, focal weakness, facial droop, seizures, confusion, collapse. Some ↑ fatigue, “a bit slower at work but better than last week”. On light duties. Not driving per hosp.  
– No falls/trauma since d/c.  

Meds  
Panadol 1g qid prn  
Nimodipine – completed  

Allergies: NKDA  

Obs  
BP 132/78 HR 82 RR 16 T 37.3 SpO2 99% RA BMI ~26  

Ex  
Gen: looks well, mild URTI.  
ENT: mild pharyngeal erythema no exudate, nasal mucosa congested, clear rhinorrhoea, TMs normal  
Neck: supple, no meningism  
Chest: CTAB, no wheeze/crackles  
Neuro: A+O x3, CN grossly intact, power 5/5 all limbs, gait normal. No focal deficit.  

A  
1) URTI – likely viral, uncomplicated. No red flags pneumonia/tonsillitis/CNS infection.  
2) Recent aneurysmal SAH s/p coiling – early post-hosp review. Stable, no features rebleed or DCI. Post-SAH fatigue/cog slowing mild.  

P  
1) URTI  
– Reassure viral, expect 7–10/7 course  
– Cont Panadol 1g up to qid prn (max 4g/24h)  
– Saline nasal spray / steam / simple lozenges / warm fluids prn  
– Avoid OTC NSAIDs for now given recent ICH  
– RTC/ED if ↑SOB, CP, green/bloody sputum, T >38.5 >3/7, or no better ~10/7  

2) Post-SAH  
– Hosp d/c summary reviewed (in Best Practice – scanned 12/11/25) – coiled, no peri-procedural issues, nimodipine 21/7 as per protocol, avoid heavy lifting/driving.  
– Explained URTI not ↓ brain O2 given normal sats/obs  
– Red flag advice: 000/ED if sudden severe “worst ever” HA, LOC/collapse, new weakness/numbness, speech diff, facial droop, visual loss/double vision, confusion, seizure, or severe neck stiffness esp w fever  
– No heavy lifting/strenuous exercise until cleared by neurosurg  
– Driving: remain off until neurosurg/neurology clearance per Austroads – to discuss at OPD in ~2/52  
– Work: ok to cont reduced hrs/light duties, pace self  

Ix  
Nil today – no indication. Hosp imaging/bloods recent. (Check full d/c + imaging report uploaded – admin task)  

F/up  
– Review 2–3/52 after neurosurg appt (note says clinic 2/12/25 – confirm) for post-SAH f/up, driving/work plan, CV risk (lipids, BP, etc)  
– Earlier if URTI worse or neuro red flags as above  

Billing
