On Google most nights reading re dementia cancers symptom checker sites etc  
Ruminates over minor bodily sx eg intermittent bloating occasional brief HAs prior self limiting dizziness indigestion → fears "might be cancer" or dementia rapidly worsening

Recent Ix

# Impression  
1. GAD – chronic known dx currently mod exacerbation with difficulty controlling worry prominent health anxiety reassurance seeking likely multifactorial  
   - baseline GAD  
   - dementia related uncertainty  
   - ↑ internet searching esp at night  
   - poor sleep hygiene  
   Nil red flags for MDD psychosis or acute risk today  

2. Dementia – known mild–mod Alzheimer type appears gradual progression subjectively slight decline but remains independent basic ADLs with some IADL support  
   No features of delirium today (no acute change infection sx or fluctuating conscious state vitals stable)  

3. Health anxiety behaviour – frequent contacts to practice + Dr Google use contributing to distress risk of over investigation if not managed carefully  

No clinical features today to suggest underlying malignancy or other serious organic dx  
- nil B sx  
- exam unremarkable  
- recent bloods normal  
Explained to pt at length  

# Plan  

## GAD / Health anxiety  
- Psychoeducation re GAD dementia interaction and how checking / Googling can maintain anxiety  
- Suggested limits on internet health searching eg set times avoid late night avoid symptom checker sites use Healthdirect etc  
- Sleep hygiene discussed esp no phone/iPad in bed regular bedtime caffeine only AM  

Meds  
Given ongoing sx and partial response to sertaline 50mg will trial cautious ↑ dose  
- Sertraline 50→75mg mane for 2/52 then if tolerated and still symptomatic ↑ to 100mg mane (PBS general)  
- Discussed potential SEs esp GI upset agitation risk hyponatraemia in older adults advised to r/v earlier if new confusion HAs unsteadiness or falls  

Ix  
- Ordered FBC U&E incl Na CMP LFT TFT today to reassess metabolic contributors and monitor w planned SSRI ↑  
  Path form given to attend on site collection today or next few days  

Benzos  
- Not prescribing benzo given age dementia ↑fall and dependence risk  
- Pt asked re "a little Valium to take the edge off" explained risks she reluctantly accepted plan to avoid benzos  

Psychology  
- Re offered psych / CBT focusing on health anxiety strategies pt now more open if close to home daughter can assist transport  
- Plan: MHCP style referral to local psych with interest in older adults anxiety  
  Will send e-referral today provided pt with brief written info asked daughter to help organise booking  

Safety net  
- SI nil at present  
- Advised to contact practice or after hours GP or present to ED if any SI severe distress new neuro sx or other red flag physical sx  

## Dementia  
- Reassured no signs of acute deterioration today appears gradual progression only  
- Continue donepezil 5mg nocte  
- Encouraged cognitively stimulating but non distressing activities eg crosswords music time w family rather than late night health searching  

- With pt consent brief corridor discussion w daughter  
  Asked to monitor for stepwise changes in cognition function or sudden confusion or falls and to book urgent review if occurs  

## Other chronic issues (brief)  
- HTN hyperlipidaemia OA knees appear stable today  
- Meds otherwise unchanged  

# F/U  
- R/V 3–4/52 longer appt 20min for  
  - f/u anxiety  
  - response/tolerability to sertaline ↑  
  - blood results  
  - further dementia management discussion (driving status ACP etc) ideally w daughter present  
- Earlier review if anxiety markedly worse emergent low mood or SI new physical sx eg persistant wt loss fevers signif pain or SE from meds esp confusion falls severe GI upset  

Pt still somewhat preoccupied asking several times "are you sure its not cancer" reiterated based on Hx exam and recent tests no indication for imaging or further cancer workup today but will continue to monitor

Supervisor addendum – Dr Nguyen 22/11/25 16:20  

Discussed case with registrar after consult  
Agree this appears to be exacerbation of underlying GAD with significant health anxiety in context of known mild–mod dementia rather than new organic pathology  

Agree with cautious sertaline ↑ 50→75mg then →100mg mane if tolerated in 2/52 given partial response so far and age  
Appropriate to repeat U&E incl Na LFT TFT in context of dose ↑ and age >75yrs  

No current indication for benzos agree to avoid  
Psychology referral appropriate though access may be limited wait times in area discussed use of PHN / older persons psych services if difficulty accessing private psych  

No red flags re malignancy or delirium on todays assessment so reasonable to avoid over investigation at this stage with clear safety net  
Plan for f/u 3–4/52 appropriate
