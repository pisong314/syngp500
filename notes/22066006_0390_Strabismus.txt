Reason for visit  
F/U eye issue specialist appt and general check  

Subjective  
27F early childhood educator Anglo-Celtic usually well  
Seen ~6/52 ago re R eye “wandering” → ref optom → now has ophthal appt booked ~4/52  

Today  
Ongoing intermittent outward drift R eye esp when tired or focusing at distance  
Says “it just goes abit off to the side sometimes” notices more in photos and when reading stories to kids on the mat  
Mild eye strain frontal/ocular ache by end of workday ~3–4/7 “just a bit sore nothing really I’ve put up with worse”  
Diplopia nil most of time very occasional brief double vision when very fatigued resolves with blinking or refocusing  
No acute change since last r/v  

Feels mildly self conscious @work colleagues have said her “eye looks tired”  
Worried kids might start commenting  
Nil loss of vision halos flashes field loss  
Nil redness discharge photophobia  
Nil HA waking from sleep nil vomiting nil focal neuro Sx limb weakness speech disturbance  

Pt wondering if “too much time on the iPad doing programming stuff” or new stronger overhead lights have “made the eye lazy”  
Has ↓device use slightly no change  

No known childhood strabismus parents never mentioned patching or glasses as child  
No FHx strabismus major eye disease  
Does not wear specs or contacts  

PMHx  
Nil signif  

Meds  
None regular  
Occasional paracetamol for tension type HA post work  

Allergies  
NKDA  

SHx  
Non smoker  
EtOH 2–3 std drinks/wk  
Lives with partner in rental unit drives  
Works FT long day care mix of close work supervising kids some computer admin evenings  
Reluctant to take time off “dont want to muck them around at the centre”  

Behaviour  
Pt a bit reserved tends to minimise Sx “didn’t want to be a bother” booking F/U  
Answers Qs clearly when prompted  

Objective  
Obs  
BP 112/70 HR 74 reg RR 14 SpO₂ 99% RA afeb  

Gen  
Well appearing young woman NAD  

Eyes  
VA approx Snellen in room with pinhole  
R 6/6 L 6/6 distance J1 near OU  
External normal nil ptosis nil periorbital swelling nil conjunctival injection corneas clear nil discharge  
Pupils equal round reactive to light nil RAPD  
EOM full all directions  
Cover–uncover test intermittent exodeviation R eye on distant target small–mod angle appears comitant more evident with fatigue during exam  
Alternate cover test suggests alternating exotropia but R exotropia more common refixation movements symmetric nil obvious paralytic pattern  
Nil nystagmus  

Fundoscopy undilated direct  
Discs sharp margins normal colour nil papilloedema maculae appear normal no obvious retinal lesions  

Neuro  
CN II–XII grossly intact normal facial movement and sensation limb power 5/5 gait normal  

No other system exam today due to time focus on eye  

Assessment  
1 Intermittent exotropia adult onset strabismus  
   Stable over last 6/52 mild Sx preserved VA normal fundus and neuro exam  
   Comitant pattern no vertical component nil red flag features to suggest acute neuro or intracranial process at present  

2 Occupational psychosocial impact  
   Pt worried re appearance and comments @work some ↓confidence reluctant to request time off for specialist appts  

DDx considered  
• Decompensating long standing phoria now symptomatic  
• Primary intermittent exotropia adult onset  
• Less likely CN palsy or restrictive myopathy given full EOM comitant deviation and symmetric refixation  
• Intracranial pathology incl mass lesion aneurysm demyelination considered low likelihood currently given nil HA red flags nil neuro deficit normal discs  
• Thyroid eye disease unlikely nil systemic features nil proptosis  

Plan  
Discussed probable dx intermittent exotropia in detail explained adult onset strabismus warrants formal ophthal assessment to exclude structural/neuro causes and to explore Rx options eg prism lenses orthoptic exercises ± surgery if indicated  

Confirmed ophthal appt date/time in pt’s phone encouraged attendance even if feels “no worse”  
Addendum to existing referral via secure messaging summarised today  
   – Sx stable  
   – Intermittent exotropia R>alternating  
   – VA 6/6 OU  
   – Fundus and basic neuro exam normal  

Safety net  
Advised urgent same day GP/ED if any of  
   – sudden constant diplopia  
   – acute ↑ in deviation  
   – new ptosis  
   – severe HA esp with vomiting  
   – visual field loss flashes new floaters  
   – eye pain/redness  
   – focal neuro Sx weakness numbness speech disturbance  
Pt verbalised understanding  

Symptom management  
Short breaks from near work/screens 20–20–20 rule to ↓eye strain reassured current screen use and lighting unlikely primary cause though may exacerbate fatigue  
Simple analgesia PRN eg paracetamol up to 1 g q4–6h PRN max 4 g/24h  
Encouraged adequate sleep hydration  

Work  
Provided brief generic letter for employer if needed to support time off for ophthal r/v emphasised early assessment to protect long term ability to work esp in role requiring sustained visual conc  

Ix  
Nil ordered today reassuring optic discs and neuro exam no current indication for urgent neuroimaging  
Will defer imaging decision to ophthal unless red flags develop  

Follow up  
GP F/U after ophthal review book 15 min to discuss findings and ongoing mgmt options  
Earlier r/v if any red flag Sx or if Sx worsen functionally  

Other  
Pt briefly mentioned intermittent non specific neck/shoulder tightness end of day likely postural/occupational  
Asked pt to book separate appt to address MSK and ergonomics in more detail due to time today
