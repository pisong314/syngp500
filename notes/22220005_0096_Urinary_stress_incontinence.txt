# Reason for visit  
F/U urinary leakage  
Booked as “suprapubic tenderness may be present in some cases – worried about bladder” per pt  

# Hx  
56yo Anglo-Aust female PT retail assistant known health anxious  
Seen ~3/52 ago re stress UI started pelvic floor ex + lifestyle advice  

Today  
- Still leakage with cough sneeze lifting laughing small vols  
- Nil dysuria nil frank haematuria nil malodour  
- New awareness “pressure or tenderness above the pubic bone” x ~1/52 mild intermittent non radiating no clear trigger  
- Very anxious has been googling “suprapubic tenderness and bladder cancer” requesting “full bladder scan and blood tests just to be safe”  
- Monitoring urine colour at home one episode darker after coffee → ↑anxiety  
- Worried bladder damage from holding on@work and pads “making things worse”  

LUTS  
- Clear stress pattern only  
- Nil urgency nil urge incontinence  
- Frequency ~5–6/day baseline nil ↑  
- Nocturia 0–1 longstanding  
- Nil fever rigors flank pain N/V  
- Nil recent pelvic surgery nil new meds no HRT postmenopausal LMP 52  

Pads most days mild groin irritation no open areas  

Func / social  
- Works retail 3d/wk lifting stock avoids fluids@work due to fear of leakage → mild arvo HAs  
- Lives with husband supportive husband agrees she “worries a lot about health” but happy she is getting checked  
- Non smoker social EtOH 1–2 coffees/day  

Health anxiety  
Longstanding pattern freq presentations for minor sx strong cancer fears heavy internet use  
Today repeated questioning re missed bladder ca asking several times “are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests”  
Extensive discussion held re nature of sx differentials incl UTI bladder ca gynae pathology MSK abdo causes benign pelvic floor issues anxiety related somatic focus  
Discussed pros cons of further Ix incl US cystoscopy bloods vs stepwise approach based on red flags evidence guidelines pt aware overtesting can → incidental findings further anxiety possible invasive procedures  

Past hx  
Nil sig comorbidities documented  
Meds only PRN paracetamol  
NKDA

Gen  
Well appearing NAD anxious affect but cooperative speech coherant  

Abdo  
Soft non distended  
Nil tenderness incl suprapubic on careful superficial + deep palpation  
Pt indicates suprapubic area but no reproducible TTP  
Nil masses organomegaly bladder not palpable  
Nil CVA tenderness  

Pelvic (chaperone offered declined pt comfortable)  
Ext genitalia normal  
Vaginal mild atrophic change nil discharge nil obvious POP on Valsalva  
Bimanual non tender uterus/adnexae nil masses  
Pelvic floor mod weakness poor sustain contraction needs cues  

Skin  
Mild erythema groin c/w pad use skin intact  

# Ix today  
Urine dip fresh MSU in rooms  
- Clear yellow  
- Nitrite leucocytes blood protein glucose ketones all neg  
- pH 6 SG ~1.020  

MSU sent to pathology (S&N) for M/C/S despite neg dipstick primarily for reassurance and to definitively exclude UTI/asymp bacteriuria at pt request  
Explained test purpose limits possible outcomes and that false pos/contaminants can occur pt verbalised understanding  

# Assessment  
1 Stress urinary incontinence 22220005 postmenopausal persistent but stable c/w pelvic floor weakness  
2 Reported suprapubic “tenderness” not reproduced on exam normal obs neg dip nil systemic sx → likely benign pelvic awareness ± anxiety rather than UTI malignancy or acute abdo  
3 Health anxiety with prominent cancer fears internet driven catastrophic thinking contributing to symptom focus and repeated reassurance seeking  
4 Mild pad related irritant dermatitis groin  

Differentials discussed explicitly  
- UTI incl cystitis pyelo – currently unlikely given nil dysuria systemic sx neg dip normal exam  
- Bladder ca – discussed red flags (visible haematuria persistent microscopic haematuria recurrent UTIs wt loss persistent suprapubic pain) none present today risk currently very low  
- Gynae pathology incl POP pelvic mass – exam reassuring  
- MSK abdo wall strain from lifting – possible contributor but nil focal tenderness  
Pt advised that based on current findings further imaging or cystoscopy not indicated at this stage consistent with guidelines  

# Plan  

Stress UI / suprapubic concern  
- Detailed explanation of stress incontinence mechanism pelvic floor + urethral support esp post menopause  
- Clarified that suprapubic tenderness in bladder pathology usually with clear infection signs or haematuria which she does not have  
- Emphasised gradual improvement over months with consistent pelvic floor work rather than quick fix  

Pelvic floor / bladder habits  
- Reviewed basic pelvic floor squeeze technique today pt still struggling to isolate muscles  
- Referral pelvic floor physio (local Newcastle) for supervised pelvic floor training + bladder training  
  Discussed likely program duration (at least 3/12) expected benefits and that surgery generally reserved for refractory cases  
  Pt initially hesitant due to embarrassment but agreed after explanation  
- Advised regular voiding q3–4h avoid deliberate fluid restriction target ~1.5–2L/day mainly water suggested ↓coffee to 1/day if possible  

Skin / pads  
- Recc zinc based barrier cream (eg Sudocrem zinc & castor oil) BD and after pad changes  
- Suggested trial of continence specific pads via pharmacy rather than sanitary pads for better absorbency + skin protection written info sheet provided  
- If persistent skin issues will consider continence nurse r/v  

Vaginal oestrogen  
- Discussed role of local vaginal oestrogen in postmenopausal urogenital sx potential modest benefit for UI vulvovaginal atrophy  
- Covered risks vs benefits incl minimal systemic absorption low breast/endo ca risk vs symptom relief  
- Pt interested but anxious “oestrogen and cancer”  
- Provided written info (Healthdirect + RANZCOG style pt leaflet) to take home discuss with husband  
- Plan to revisit decision next appt not commenced today  

Investigations / further tests  
- MSU M/C/S as above will f/u result  
- Discussed that if culture neg and sx unchanged then no indication for imaging cystoscopy or bloods at this stage  
- Explained potential harms of overtesting incl false positives incidentalomas anxiety cost  
- Pt verbalised understanding repeated back key red flags but still mildly preoccupied  
- Agreed stepwise approach with clear triggers to escalate Ix  

Health anxiety  
- Acknowledged distress validated concerns  
- Advised limiting random internet searches suggested reputable sites (Healthdirect Continence Foundation of Australia) written list given  
- Briefly introduced idea of CBT/psych input for health anxiety if ongoing impact on QoL  
- Pt prefers to “sort the bladder first” but open to future longer mental health consult or MHCP if needed  

Informed consent / shared decision making  
- Extensive discussion re differential dx serious vs benign causes options for Ix vs conservative mgmt risks benefits and uncertainties  
- Pt asked multiple clarifying questions re chance of missed ca what sx would prompt urgent tests  
- I explained in detail that based on current evidence exam and tests probability of bladder ca or other serious pathology today is very low but can never be 0  
- Pt able to summarise back plan and red flag sx in her own words  
- She agrees to conservative mgmt pelvic floor physio MSU check and watchful waiting with clear safety net  

Safety netting  
Explicit safety net provided  
Seek urgent r/v GP or ED if  
- Visible blood in urine  
- New or persistent dysuria frequency urgency or foul smelling urine  
- Fever ≥38C rigors flank pain feeling systemically unwell  
- Worsening constant suprapubic or abdo pain esp with N/V  
- New difficulty initiating stream poor flow inability to pass urine or marked change in pattern of leakage  
Also advised to book earlier GP appt if anxiety escalates or new concerning info from internet etc rather than sitting at home worrying  
Pt states understands when to return and that she will not ignore new red flag sx  

# Meds  
- Nil regular meds  
- No changes today  
- Barrier cream OTC as above (discussed use)  

# Follow up / admin  
- Await MSU result  
  Plan  
  • If abnormal → contact pt by phone/SMS within 24–48h discuss need for abx and further Ix  
  • If normal → discuss at next appt  
- Asked pt to book longer f/u 3–4/52 for  
  • Review symptoms + physio engagement  
  • Review MSU result  
  • Revisit vaginal oestrogen  
  • More time re health anxiety mgmt / ?MHCP if indicated  
- Pt left appearing somewhat reassured but still mildly preoccupied accepted plan and physio ref
