58F here re “wee leaking again – it’s getting really annoying, I just want something done today”. Known stress incontinence from last visit ~3/12 ago, didn’t go to physio as planned.

Hx all over the place – mainly small dribbles with cough/sneeze, lifting boxes at work, sometimes when rushing for bus. No burning, no blood, no fevers, no night-time wetting. Says “it’s only dribbles but I’m sick of it”. Wants “a scan or a bladder specialist” and asked “can’t you just give me something to tighten things up or a catheter so I don’t have to keep running to the loo?”. Declined catheter after explanation but keeps asking why I can’t “just prescribe what I’m asking for”.  

Post-menopause, some vaginal dryness, no HRT. G3P3, all VD, big babies, ?tear with first. No prolapse sx volunteered.

O/E (brief, chaperone nurse):  
BP 132/78, HR 76, afebrile.  
Abdo soft, NT.  
Pelvic: mild atrophic changes, mild anterior wall laxity only, no obvious prolapse. Cough test supine – small leak seen. Pelvic floor weak, hard for her to hold contraction.

Urine dip (today, midstream, in rooms): SG 1.020, trace WCC, nitrite neg, no blood, no protein, no glucose. Asymptomatic for UTI → no MSU to SNP today.

Dx (working):  
- Stress urinary incontinence – persistent, mild–mod, likely multifactorial (parity, pelvic floor weakness, postmenopause, on-feet job, BMI↑). No features of OAB/overflow/UTI.  
- Postmenopausal vaginal atrophy.

Plan – discussed at length, pt a bit frustrated but agreed in the end:  

- Pelvic floor physio: referral done today to local pelvic floor physio (community). She said “that’ll take ages” but agreed to go if I print the referral.  
- Topical oestrogen:  
  • Estriol 0.5 mg vaginal cream, PBS, apply nightly x 2 weeks then BD weekly ongoing. Script given, counselled re local use, low systemic absorption.  
- Basic bladder strategies mentioned (regular voiding, avoid overfilling) – not documented in detail here.  
- Suggested trial cutting down caffeine/fizzy drinks (she thinks soda water is “weakening the bladder”) – reassured not the cause but ok to reduce.  

No imaging ordered today – explained usual guidelines, need to try conservative mgmt 3–6/12 first. She wants “a bladder surgeon” now; documented that she understands plan is physio + oestrogen first, then consider urogynae/urology + urodynamics if still bad at review. Not happy but accepts for now.  

No bloods ordered today re this issue.  

Follow-up: review 3/12 to assess response, earlier if new urgency, dysuria, visible haematuria, fevers, difficulty passing urine etc.  

Raised cholesterol check + sore knees at end of consult – asked to book separate appt due to time.
