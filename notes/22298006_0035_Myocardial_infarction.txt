68M, retired construction worker, Anglo-Aust  

CC: “dizzy… very weak… no wee” per daughter. “Felt real crook yesterday, chest real bad but I lie down, ok now.”  

Hx (via daughter mostly, pt limited Eng, keeps nodding “yes”):  
3–4h hx marked weakness + light-headed esp on standing  
Yesterday pm: “bad chest pain, sweating” ~30–40 mins, refused hosp, settled w rest  
Since last night ↓urine (one small void o/night, none this am)  
Daughter: “his neck vein sticking out when he’s half sitting”  
No SOB, no cough, no wheeze, no orthopnoea, no leg swell  
Mild nausea, no vomit  
Home BP this am “very low” ~85/60 (not recorded)  
No known prev MI/angina/HTN/AF/HF. No reg meds. Ex-smoker (~10y ago).  

Obs (clinic):  
BP 82/54 sitting → 88/58 supine  
HR 96 reg  
RR 18  
SpO₂ 97% RA  
T 36.6  

Exam (focused):  
Looks pale, unwell, mildly sweaty, prefers supine  
JVP ↑ to angle of jaw @45°  
HS dual, no obvious murmur (noisy room, brief)  
Periph cool, CRT ~3s, no oedema  
Chest clear, no crackles/wheeze  
Abdo soft, NT, no mass, bladder not palpable  
Neuro grossly non-focal  

ECG (12L, clinic):  
Sinus ~95  
ST ↑ II, III, aVF w reciprocal ST ↓ I, aVL → c/w acute inferior STEMI. Pattern + hypotension + ↑JVP + clear lungs → ?RV infarct  

BGL 7.1 mmol/L  

Imp:  
1) Suspected acute inferior STEMI + RV involvement → hypotension + oliguria + ↑JVP + clear chest → high risk evolving cardiogenic shock  
2) Lang barrier (CALD, no prof interpreter avail) – consent via daughter only  

Plan (time-critical, ~10–15 min):  
– Explained in simple terms via daughter: “heart not pumping right… possible heart attack… BP dangerously low… need hospital now or could collapse/die”  
– Pt: “ok, hospital, heart no good”  
– 000 called → urgent ambulance, request priority transfer to nearest PCI-capable ED. Handover: probable inferior + RV STEMI, hypotensive, oliguria, ↑JVP, clear lungs, recent chest pain, no GTN given  
– Position: supine, slight head up, monitored BP/HR/SpO₂ while waiting  
– Meds here: Aspirin 300 mg PO stat, chewed (no prior today, no known allergy). Time given documented in ambulance sheet  
– NO GTN (hypotension + ?RV infarct)  
– NO morphine (no sig pain now + hypotension)  
– O₂ not started (SpO₂ 97% RA)  
– IV fluids left to ambos/ED (clinic not set up for safe monitored bolus, ETA mins)  

To ED for: serial ECGs, trop, FBE, U&E, CMP, coags, CXR, echo, cardiology review, PCI as indicated, haemodynamic support incl cautious fluids for RV infarct, avoid preload ↓ agents  

Letter sent with ambos summarising hx/exam/ECG + concern RV infarct.  

F/up: asked daughter to book GP review 1–2/52 post-discharge for post-MI meds (DAPT, statin, ACEI/ARB, βB etc), cardiac rehab, risk factor work-up.  

If deterioration pre-ambulance (more chest pain, collapse, SOB) → daughter to call 000 again. Staff stayed w pt till transfer.
