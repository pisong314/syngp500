Plan  
# Psychoeducation  
Discussed expected grief course intensity may fluctuate often improves over mths may spike anniversaries  
Explained grief vs major depn incl red flags persistent inability to function pervasive worthlessness strong SI ↑EtOH etc  
Validated distress explained benzos not 1st line for grief related insomnia esp ongoing use  
Firm boundary re diazepam request pt frustrated but remained engaged  

# Meds  
Declined diazepam due dependence tolerance poorer sleep architecture  
Agreed short hypnotic  
– Temazepam 10 mg nocte PRN for sleep max 5 nights only small qty no rpt PBS  
Advice no driving if drowsy nil alcohol stop once sleep slightly beter  
Discussed risks dep tolerance falls next day sedation pt verbalised understanding still abit unhappy but accepts trial  
Antidepressants discussed SSRIs not 1st line at 7/52 in context of normal grief pattern no clear MDD will reconsider if sx persist/worsen or MDD features emerge  
Plan re consider SSRI eg sertraline if still significantly impaired in ~4/52  

# Non pharm  
Brief grief counselling today encouraged routine sleep hygiene light exercise daily walks grounding breathing journalling at night  
Encouraged time with mum sister talking about father
