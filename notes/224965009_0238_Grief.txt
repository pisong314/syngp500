Hx:  
Since wife died 5/12 ago → marked ↓function, ↓motivation  
Now mostly sitting/drinking/TV, no interest fishing/mates  
Low mood most days, anhedonia, poor conc, fatigue, guilt re wife’s death  
Sleep poor (init + early waking 3–4am), ~4–5h, ↓appetite  
Passive SI “better if not here” but no plan/intent, says won’t act b/c kids. No prev attempts  
No psychotic sx. Some fleeting sense of wife presence but reality testing intact  
↑EtOH since bereavement – prev 6–8 beers/night → now ~10–12 mids most nights, wknd binges. Uses beer to sleep. Hx mild LFT derangement 18/12 ago

Exam (phone only):  
Speech slow/flat, tearful when wife mentioned. Cognition grossly intact. No SOB, CP, fever, focal neuro by hx. No obvious intox on call  

Impr:  
1) MDD exacerbation on background acute grief  
2) Acute grief rxn (5/12 post-bereavement) – significant but still within expected timeframe  
3) Alcohol use disorder – harmful use, ↑post-bereavement  
4) Language barrier – relying on daughter interpreter → some risk re hx/consent  

Plan:  
– ↑sertraline to 100 mg mane (from 50) – emphasised daily, not to stop abruptly  
– Thiamine 100 mg mane – restart; new script  
– Brief EtOH counselling – link ↑EtOH with worse mood/sleep. Agreed trial ↓ by ~2 cans/night, avoid spirits for now  
– No benzos/hypnotics given EtOH + SI risk  
– Safety: passive SI only, no plan, strong protective factor = kids. Advised 000/ED if SI ↑ or feels may act. Daughter/son to monitor and call clinic/000 if deterioration
