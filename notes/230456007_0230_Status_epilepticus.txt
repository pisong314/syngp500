A  
1 Focal epilepsy w 2° gen prev convulsive status epilepticus – well controlled on levetiracetam seizure free GTC ~18/12 auras x2 early post event nil for ~9–10/12 currently stable no red flags today ongoing AED indicated to ↓risk recurrence incl further status  
2 Meds management – needs rpt levetiracetam mild cognitive fatigue / fog esp nights likely multifactorial shift work + Keppra but non limiting nil concerning AE  
3 Shift work sleep disruption – known trigger likely contrib to initial event discussed sleep hygiene and avoiding long runs of nights where poss  
4 Preconception – not currently planning preg brief discussion only full R/V closer to time  

P  
1 Epilepsy  
- Continue levetiracetam 1000mg BD  
  Script given Keppra 1000mg tabs 1 tab BD qty 180 rpt x1 PBS  
- Reinforced adherence esp around night shifts suggested keeping doses to fairly fixed clock times + alarms already using  
- Safety advice again seizure >5mins or repeated w/o full recovery → call 000 to ED partner to place in recovery position protect from injury do not restrain  

2 Monitoring  
- Bloods as above today results via MyHR / practice inbox will r/v results next appt or earlier if abn
