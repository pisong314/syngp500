42F here mainly for “lower back’s been a bit crook the last couple of weeks” – also ended up talking about her being sleepy all the time.

Back – about 2 wks, gradual, central low lumbar, a bit to R side. Dull ache, can be sharp bending, up to ~6–7/10 if pushed but says “mostly just annoying”. Worse after long periods at desk, lifting shopping. A bit stiff first 10–15 mins in the morning then eases. No leg pain, no pins/needles, no weakness, no bowel/bladder change, no saddle numbness, no fevers/wt loss/night sweats, no trauma. Thinks maybe new office chair / slept funny on couch. Still working part-time, just avoiding heavier jobs at home.

Exam (limited – running late): looks tired but comfortable. BP 118/72, HR 74, afebrile, sats 99% RA, BMI ~27. Mild tenderness R lumbar paraspinals, no midline tenderness. Slight ↓ flexion with pain but can move in all directions. SLR neg both sides, LL power/reflexes/sensation grossly normal, gait ok.

Impression: acute mechanical LBP, likely muscular strain / posture related. No red flags today, no radiculopathy.

Plan back:
- Reassured. Expect improvement over next few weeks.
- Paracetamol 1 g up to QID PRN – encouraged to actually use short term if needed.
- Heat, keep moving, avoid long periods sitting – brief chat re desk ergonomics.
- Offered physio; she reluctant re cost, wants to see if settles first.
- RTC/ED if new neuro sx, bowel/bladder issues, night pain, fevers, trauma etc.

While talking, hypersomnolence came up – longstanding. Says “I could nap pretty much any time, anywhere”, partner apparently complains she nods off on couch and at work. She minimises (“probably nothing, partner going on about it”). Known hx of “periodic limb movements” on sleep study ~2 yrs ago with private sleep specialist in Sydney – no records in Best Practice, not on treatment. Kicks in sleep, partner disturbed. No snoring/apnoeas per partner, no cataplexy, no sleep paralysis or hallucinations. In bed ~10–11pm, up 6–6:30, unrefreshed. Drives short distances, admits feels “drowsy a lot”, has zoned out at red lights but denies actually falling asleep driving.

Mood – known depression on sertraline 50 mg mane, misses “a few here and there”. Low motivation, fatigue, poor concentration, “foggy”, but denies current SI. No other major PMHx. NKDA. Non-smoker, minimal ETOH.

Partner (not present but per pt) quite worried re daytime sleepiness and driving, thinks she is underplaying it.

Today’s focus limited (time) but concern re hypersomnolence + PLMS + depression mix, and driving risk. Aetiology not clear – ?idiopathic hypersomnolence vs other central disorder, old workup incomplete.

Plan sleep/mood:
- Advised not to drive when sleepy; keep to essential short trips only for now and stop immediately if drowsy.
- Bloods ordered via SNP today: FBC, U&E, LFT, TFT, B12, folate, ferritin, fasting glucose, lipids, ESR/CRP – screen for anaemia, thyroid, nutritional, inflammatory causes of fatigue.
- Will request previous sleep study + letters from private sleep clinic in Sydney (pt gave approximate name).
- Discussed re-referral to sleep physician to review hypersomnolence/PLMS and consider options incl. modafinil or other therapy; she not keen on “strong meds” or more tests but agreed in principle, wants to see bloods first. Referral to be done once records/bloods back (flagged).
- Brief sleep hygiene chat only (consistent bedtime/waketime, screens, caffeine etc.).
- Encouraged regular sertraline (not intermittent). Need longer appt to review depression and whether dose/agent needs change vs sedation.

Follow-up:
- Path today with nurse.
- Book review 1–2 wks for back pain + blood results – asked for longer (20 min) if possible to start proper sleep/depression review.
- Earlier if back worse or any neuro red flags, or if sleepiness worsens / near-miss accident driving.

[Addendum 16:10 – Dr J. Lee]  
Bloods not back yet. Reminder set to chase old sleep study report before next review.
