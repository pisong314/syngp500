22/11/25 14:20 – Home visit – large rural town  

CC  
“My legs are getting weaker, feet keep giving way – just need something stronger, I’ve only got 10 minutes.”  

HPC  
- 10–14/7 prog bilat leg/foot weakness on background ~6–8/12 R sciatica  
- R>L foot “slap” when walking fast, now L ankle “not lifting properly”, esp stairs  
- 2x near-falls this wk “feet just don’t pick up properly”  
- Can only walk ~50–100 m, better leaning on trolley  
- R radicular pain buttock→postlat thigh→lat calf→dorsum foot, burning/electric, 4–5/10 baseline, to 8/10 post-shift  
- Tingling/numb R L5 derm, milder L L5  
- No bladder/bowel sx, no saddle anaesthesia, no fevers/wt loss/trauma  

PMHx  
- ?Chronic LBP / “sciatica” (ED ~4/12 ago). No DM, no spinal surg.  

Meds  
- PRN paracetamol, ibuprofen. No AC. NKDA.  

SHx  
- Aged care worker, heavy manual handling. Lives alone. Worried about work: “If I can’t walk properly I’ll lose shifts.”  

O/E 14:30  
Obs: BP 132/84, HR 78 reg, RR 16, SpO2 98% RA, afebrile.  
Gait: antalgic, ↓R foot clearance, mild R foot slap, cautious turns.  
Neuro LL:  
- Power: HF 5/5, KE 5/5, PF 5/5 bilat. Ankle DF R 4-/5, L 4/5. EHL R 4-/5, L 4/5  
- Reflexes: KJ 2+ bilat, AJ R 1+, L 2+, plantars ↓going  
- Sens: ↓LT/PP R L5, mild ↓ L L5. No saddle loss.  
- SLR: R +ve @40°→radic pain calf; L +ve @60°→buttock/post thigh  
Abdo soft, no SP tenderness/distension.  

Impression  
- Prog bilat L5-predom motor radiculopathy (R>L) on background R sciatica  
- ?L4/5 ± L5/S1 disc prolapse vs spinal canal stenosis  
- No current CES (no bladder/bowel/saddle), but red flag: prog bilat weakness + near falls  

Plan 14:40  
- Discussed seriousness. Pt initially focused on “just a quick script”, agreed to urgent work-up once CES risk explained.  
- URGENT MRI L-spine (within 24–48h) – ?disc herniation / canal stenosis / mass / infection  
- Bloods (non-ED): FBC, U&E/Cr, LFT, ESR/CRP, HbA1c/FBG (screen DM) – when able  
- Analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN  
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food (max 1.2 g/d) if no GI/renal issues  
  - Start pregabalin 75 mg nocte x3–5/7, then ↑ to 75 mg BD if tol & still sx. Warned re sedation/dizziness, caution driving/at work.  
  - Avoid opioids for now (falls/dependence risk) – may reconsider post-MRI if pain uncontrolled.  
- Work: med cert – light duties only, no heavy lifting/resident transfers. Pt reluctant but agreed to at least next 2 shifts modified.  
- Safety net: if any new urinary retention/incontinence, bowel incontinence, numb genitals/perineum/inner thighs, sudden ↑weakness or unable to walk → 000/ED immediately.  
- Gave brief ED summary letter to pt.  
- F/U GP in 2–3/7 (home or clinic) to review MRI (if done) + repeat neuro exam, consider direct neurosurg/ED if deterioration.  

15:00 – Pt left for shift, verbalised understanding re red flags but still “really needs to keep working” – reiterated priority is preserving leg fn + continence.
