72F, known to practice. Standard appt (~15 min) but ended up 2 issues + quick DM check.

Cough
- 5 days of mainly dry cough, a bit of clear sputum. Mild sore throat first couple of days, now settled. Mild nasal congestion.
- No fevers (home T max 37.4), no SOB, no chest pain, no wheeze, no haemoptysis.
- Sleep a bit disturbed by night cough. RAT day 2 negative. COVID vax up to date, flu vax this season.
- Never smoker. No asthma/COPD/IHD/HF.
- Wonders if reflux contributing (“worse lying flat”) + mentioned new eucalyptus diffuser in bedroom.

O/E (resp brief)
- Looks well, talking in full sentences, occasional dry cough.
- T 36.9, BP 132/76, HR 78 reg, RR 16, SpO2 97% RA.
- Chest clear, vesicular BS, no focal signs.

Imp: Likely viral URTI with dry cough, no features for pneumonia/PE/HF. Low suspicion bacterial infection → no abx, no CXR today.

Plan:
- Symptomatic only (fluids, simple linctus/honey, lozenges if needed).
- Avoid lying flat, extra pillow, see if helps possible GORD element.
- Asked to stop diffuser in bedroom for now as possible irritant.
- Red flags explained briefly – SOB, high fevers, pleuritic pain, haemoptysis, confusion, or cough >4 wks → review/ED.

Back pain / sciatica / spinal stenosis (chronic, quick review only)
- Known lumbar canal stenosis with R-sided sciatica, previously seen by spinal specialist, declined surgery.
- Baseline pain ~4/10, burning R buttock → lateral calf, intermittent pins/needles R foot. Last few days up to 6/10 in evenings, thinks coughing “jars” back. No new weakness.
- Can walk ~200–300 m before needing rest (neurogenic claudication). No recent falls.
- No saddle anaesthesia, no bladder or bowel incontinence/retention, no progressive bilateral leg weakness (chronic mild R leg weakness unchanged).

O/E (very brief)
- Mild lumbar tenderness esp R paraspinals.
- SLR R 40° reproduces leg pain, L 60° ok.
- Gross power 5/5 both legs, reflexes present, gait slightly antalgic but stable.

Meds for pain currently:  
- Paracetamol 1 g bd–tds PRN.  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg bd PRN (rare).  
- Tried pregabalin in past – stopped due to dizziness/foggy.

DM2 background (relevant to meds):  
- On metformin XR 1 g mane, BSLs fasting ~6–7 by her report. No known nephropathy, last U&E/ACR ~6/12 ago “normal” per pt.
- Also on perindopril 5 mg mane, atorvastatin 20 mg nocte, Vit D.

Plan back/sciatica today:
- Reassured no current cauda equina red flags. Advised ED if saddle numbness, urinary retention/incontinence, faecal incontinence, rapidly worsening bilateral leg weakness.
- Advised to limit NSAIDs given age, DM and ACEi (renal/GI risk). Prefer paracetamol up to 1 g qid (max 4 g/day).
- No new neuropathic agent started today – time limited and pain only mildly flared. Pt asked re gabapentin vs low-dose TCA (amitriptyline) with DM/stenosis – gave brief overview, will discuss properly at longer review.
- Continue home physio/core exercises and walking as tolerated.

Medication change:
- Marked in file to AVOID regular ibuprofen; instructed PRN only and to keep usage minimal. No script given today (uses OTC).  
- No change to metformin/perindopril/atorvastatin today – to revisit once latest bloods available.

---

Diabetes – very brief
- T2DM appears reasonably controlled by home readings (no logs today).  
- HbA1c due – last one ~6–7 months ago per pt (result not in front of me, need to chase/redo).  
- Plan to order HbA1c, U&E, ACR, lipids at next long review and adjust meds if needed.

---

Follow-up / admin
- Asked to book long appt in 1–2 weeks for full chronic back pain + DM review, bring glucometer and any BSL records.
- Review sooner (within ~7–10 days) if cough not starting to settle; urgent/ED if red flag resp or cauda equina symptoms as above.

Social (relevant): lives with husband, independent, drives, good support.

[No investigations ordered today – low concern for serious resp pathology and back symptoms stable pattern.]
