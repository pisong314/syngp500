74F f/up post-stroke / “general check-up”  

Attends with daughter – provides most hx + translating  

Hx  
– Ischaemic stroke ~5/12 ago (L MCA per daughter) public hosp  
– Residual mild R arm weakness + mild word-finding diff but independent ADLs mostly  
– No new neuro sx since d/c: no sudden weakness, facial droop, slurred speech, visual loss, severe HA, collapse per daughter  
– Walks daily ~15–20 min, no falls  
– Daughter: “a bit more forgetful but mostly OK”  

Meds (box sighted)  
– Aspirin 100 mg mane  
– Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte  
No BP meds, no anticoag  

Allergies: NKDA  

Obs  
BP 148/86 → 152/88  
HR 76 reg, afebrile, SpO₂ 97% RA  
Wt 69 kg, Ht 160 cm (BMI ~27)  

Exam (focused)  
Elderly lady NAD, ambulant slow but steady  
Neuro: mild ↓ power R UL (≈4+/5), R LL 5-/5, rest 5/5, no new focal deficit, speech mildly hesitant but understands simple commands better via daughter. No facial droop, no ataxia  

Impression  
1) Hx ischaemic CVA (L MCA) 5/12 ago – stable, mild residual R sided weakness only, no e/o recurrence  
2) Prob HTN – clinic BP ~150/88, needs Rx esp for 2° stroke prevention  
3) Incomplete vascular RF workup (lipids, DM, AF etc)  
4) Language barrier – relies on daughter; ↑ risk miscommunication  

Plan  
– Continue aspirin 100 mg daily (PBS)  
– Continue atorvastatin 40 mg nocte  
– Start perindopril 2 mg mane (PBS) for BP / 2° prevention → warn dizziness, cough, stand slowly. Check U&E after start  
– Path ordered today (fasting):  
   • Fasting lipids  
   • Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
   • U&E, eGFR, electrolytes  
   • LFTs  
– ECG nurse appt this week – ?AF / other arrhythmia  
– BP target <130/80 (longer term ≤120 syst if tolerated)  
– Asked daughter to bring hosp d/c summary + imaging next visit (stroke subtype / mech / any carotid or cardiac workup)  
– Offered TIS interpreter for future longer appts – daughter agreeable (note in file)  

Safety-net  
– Reinforced FAST sx / red flags – call 000 if sudden focal neuro sx / severe sudden HA etc  
– RTC earlier if side effects from perindopril or any new neuro sx  

F/U  
– Review 2/52: BP, perindopril tolerance, path + ECG results, adjust dose as needed, brief cognition / function review  
– Longer gen health review + hearing etc later (book long appt)  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed
