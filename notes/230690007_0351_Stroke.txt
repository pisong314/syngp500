78y male, Anglo-Aus, retired accountant  

Reason for visit:  
"Check up after the stroke and what i should be eating"  

Hx / background (from past notes + pt):  
- Ischaemic CVA L MCA 6/12 ago, mild R arm/hand weaknes, completed rehab  
- Non-valv AF  
- R carotid stenosis s/p CEA 4/12 ago  
- HTN, hyperlipid  

Meds (per summary/Webster + pt):  
- Apixaban 5mg bd  
- Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
- Perindopril 5mg mane  
- Metoprolol ER 47.5mg mane  
No known drug alergy.  

Presenting issues today (abridged):  

1) Post-stroke review / secondary prevention (main)  
- Wants diet advice to "not have another stroke"  
- Says stopped adding salt, eating more porridge, less bacon. Worried re "Anzac bikkies at night" causing stroke.  
- Asks if town water "too hard" and can "clog arteries".  
- Denies new neuro sx: no new weaknes, speech change, facial droop, vision loss, TIAs. Residual fine motor R hand unchanged, still doing exercses.  
- Mobilising indep, no recent falls.  
- Reports good med complience, Webster pack, no missed doses last month. Wife confirms taking tabs.  

2) Other issues (defered)  
- Has written list (shoulder ache, toenail fungus, scalp bumps, nocturia etc).  
- Explained time limit, agreed to focus today on stroke/AF/meds, book long appt for "the list".  

Exam (focused):  
Gen: Well, chatty, keeps going back to list. NAD.  
BP 126/74, HR 76 irregularly irreg, RR 14, afeb, SpO2 98% RA, BMI ~27.  
CVS: Irreg irreg, S1/S2, no murmur, no oedema.  
Resp: Clear.  
Neuro (brief): speech ok, CN grossly intact, mild ↓ fine motor R hand, R UL power ~4+/5, rest 5/5, gait steady.  
Neck: R CEA scar well healed, no bruit.  

Impression:  
1. Hx ischaemic stroke L MCA – stable, no new deficits  
2. AF, non-valv – rate controlled, on DOAC  
3. R carotid stenosis – post CEA, stable  
4. Seccondary prevention – needs ongoing risk factor + diet review  
5. Multiple non-urgent concerns – to be addressed at long review  

Plan:  

Stroke / AF / risk factor managment:  
- Continue apixaban 5mg bd. No sig bleeding issues today. Advised to seek review if any bleeding, black stools, haematuria etc.  
- Continue atorvastatin 40mg nocte.  
- BP at target for secondary prevention, continue perindopril + metoprolol unchanged.  
- Encouraged regular walking as tolerated.  
- Alcohol: advised keep to low-moderate intake. Ex-smoker, remain abstinent.  

Diet (brief, stroke prevention focus):  
- Reassured occasional Anzac biscuit OK if overall diet healthy.  
- Emphasised more veg/fruit/wholegrains, fish/lean meats, minimise processed meats (bacon etc), low salt options.  
- Reassured town water “hardness” not a stroke trigger; main issues are BP, chol, AF, smoking, DM.  
- Pt and wife keen for more detailed plan → referral done to local community dietitian / post-stroke risk factor clinic (public).  

Ix ordered today:  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
- U&E, eGFR, LFTs (for ACEi/statin/DOAC monitoring)  
Fasting instructions given, to do at onsite colllection.  

Safety-net:  
- Advised call 000/ED if sudden neuro sx (weakness, facial droop, speech/vision change, sudden severe headache, collapse).  

Follow-up:  
- Review 4/52 to check bloods, BP, AF control, meds, diet/exercise progress.  
- Long appt booked 2/52 for shoulder pain, toenail, scalp lesions, nocturia etc (reception note: "multiple problems – review").  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 22/11/2025 – current plan as above.
