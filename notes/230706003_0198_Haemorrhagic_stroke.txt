Dx / Impression  
1 L earache likely mild otitis externa / irritative canal dermatitis 2° cotton bud + olive oil use  
   No evidence AOM mastoiditis serious pathology  
2 Recent haemorrhagic stroke 2/12 ago stable mild residual R arm deficit only  
3 HTN suboptimally controlled in context of ICH target SBP ≤120 if tolerated per stroke guidelines  

Plan  

1 L ear pain / ?mild OE irritative canal dermatitis  
   - Advised avoid cotton buds oils objects in ear canal  
   - Script ciprofloxacin 0.3% + hydrocortisone 1% ear drops 3 gtt L ear bd 5–7/7  
   - Analgesia paracetamol 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h avoid NSAIDs given prev ICH  
   - Safety net  
     • attend ED / call 000 if sudden severe headache new weakness facial droop speech or vision change  
     • r/v urgently if ↑ ear pain swelling around ear fever discharge hearing loss  

2 ICH / BP management / secondary prevention  
   - Discussed strong link HTN → recurrent ICH stressed importance strict BP control  
   - Aim home and clinic BP ideally ≤120/80 if tolerated  
   - Med adherence  
     • Encouraged regular perindopril 5mg mane and atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
     • Explored reluctance re “too many tablets” reframed as stroke prevention pt somewhat receptive wife very keen  
   - For now meds unchanged  
   - Ask wife to record home BP ~3x/week similar time bring log next visit  
   - If clinic SBP still >130 next r/v consider ↑ perindopril dose or adding 2nd agent eg indapamide  
   - Lifestyle briefly  
     • Keep EtOH ≤1–2 std drinks/day with ≥2 AF days/wk  
     • Continue daily walking physio exercises as tolerated  

   - Neuro f/u  
     • Per hosp letter stroke clinic OPD @ 3/12 post event wife says appt booked ~4/52 from now  
     • Will leave decision re antiplatelet / anticoag to neuro team  

3 Mood / post stroke adjustment  
   - Wife mentions occas low mood irritability since stroke pt says “I’m fine just a bit cranky”  
   - Time limited today advised longer appt 2–3/52 to explore mood cognition supports consider MHCP if indicated  

Ix  
Nil ordered today ear exam c/w uncomplicated mild OE stroke already fully imaged in hosp  
Plan routine post stroke bloods next visit U&E eGFR lipids fasting BSL / HbA1c when reviewing BP meds  

F/U  
- Nurse/GP f/u booked 2/52 for BP r/v + ear sx check longer appt requested also to address mood and arrange bloods  
- Standard safety net advice given  
  Pt to return earlier if sx worsen fail to improve or if any red flag sx as above incl fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion
