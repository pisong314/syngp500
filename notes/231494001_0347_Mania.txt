On “health kick but also really wired”.  
Sleep only 3–4 hrs / night x ~10 days, up late doing work projects, cleaning. Says feels “amazing, buzzing, dont need more sleep”.  
Mood high, irritable when slowed down. ↑ energy, racing thoghts, multple projects, ↑ online spending incl crypto “investments”.  
Worried re palpitaitons + poor sleep = “maybe cancer or heart condtion”, wants “full body scan, every test possible”.  
No CP, SOB, syncope, wt stable by report.

Denies drugs, EtOH 1–2 wines Fri/Sat, a lot of coffee/occas energy drink.  
No SI/HI, no psychotic sx elicited. Insight limited – sees this as “best self”, but aware psych said to watch for mania.

PMHx:

Prev single dep episode age 24 on SSRI x ~1 yr.  
Otherwise well.

Examination:  
Gen: Alert, well groomed, pacing, diffculty staying seated. Overfamiliar.  
Speech: rapid, pressurised, tangental but redirectable.  
Vitals: BP 118/72, HR 96 reg, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA, T 36.7°C. BMI ~24 (66kg/166cm).  
CVS/Resp/Abdo: NAD.

MSE (abridged):  
Mood “fantastic, buzzing”. Affect elevated, labile, irritable when I limit tests. FOI, tangential. Some grandiose ideas re work (“global marketing framework”). No clear delusions, no AVH. Oriented, distractable. Insight/judgement ↓, but agrees to psych f/u and meds.

Dx:  
1. Bipolar affective disorder – current manic episode, mod, no overt psychosis.  
2. Health anxiety / frequent attender pattern – driving reqest for excessive testing.  
3. Palpitaitons likely 2º anxiety/mania + caffeine; no red flags today.

Plan:  

Risk / dispo:  
Discussed mania can esculate quickly, impact safety/finances. No SI/HI, no psychosis, supports avail. Ok for community managment with close f/u. ED/000 if feels unsafe, very agitated, no sleep at all >24–36h, or psychotic sx.

Meds:  
- Start olanzapine 5mg nocte x 3 nights then ↑ to 10mg nocte if toleratd, for acute mania sx. Drowsiness/weight/metabolic risk discused. PBS genric.  
- Temazepam 10mg nocte PRN insomnnia, max 10 tabs, no rpt. Avoid EtOH/driving if sedated.  
- Reinforced DO NOT restart sertraline or other ADs without psych/GP review – can worsen mania.  
Long term mood stabiliser (lithium vs valproate etc) to be started by psych – only brief discusion today.

Ix:  
Baseline + to address concerns but set boundries (declined “full body scan” etc).  
- FBC  
- UEC, CMP (EUC, creat, etc)  
- LFT  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
- TSH  
- Serum β-hCG (preg screen, poss future lithium/valproate)  
Forms given for Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology, results pendng.  
BP/wt done today, plan metab monit 3–6 mthly if ongoing antipsychotic.  
ECG offered but deferred today (time, low suspicn); to arrange if palpitaitons persist/worsen.

Referrals:  
- Urgent (same wk) referal to local public mental health team / community psych – first clear manic epsiode, no mood stabiliser, ↓ judgement, sleep ↓. E-referral sent via HealthLink + faxed brief summary.  
- Info re local youth MH services (Headspace etc) though at upper age range.

Brief advice (limited time):  
- Focus today on mood/sleep/safety rather than full diet check.  
- Rec reg sleep routine, reduce caffeine/energy drinks, avoid drugs/↑ EtOH.  
- Reassured very unlikley that non-organic fruit / office water filter causing sx; main issue is bipolar episode.  
Pt advised to use reliable websites (Healthdirect, Beyond Blue) instead of extensive Googling.  

Safety net:  
RTC/telehealth in 3–4 days for review of mood, sleep, med tolerence + any early bloods.  
Sooner if worse – ↑ agitation, risk behviour, no sleep, SI/HI, psychotic sx → ED/000.  
Encouraged to let family know situation, ok to bring support person next review.

Pt engagement:  
Lots of reassurance seeking re “heart condtion / cancer” and wanting more tests. Boundaries set, rationale explaind. By end agrees this is likley mania and agrees to start olanzapine + short term temazepam and attend urgent psych appt when booked.
