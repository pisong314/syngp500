22/11/25 09:12 – Tel consult – bulk billed (walk-in, first time here)

Pt: 29F RN, works metro hospital. Non-smoker. No reg meds, NKDA.

Reason for call: wants “Centrelink form + medical cert + antibiotics”. Says ongoing “chesty infection”.

Illness hx (bit all over the place):  
~10 days cough started after sore throat, initially dry, now still mostly dry, tiny bit clear/yellow sputum. Fatigued, “wiped out”, low-grade temps at home up to 38.3° mostly evenings with chills. Mild sharp chest pain with deep breath/cough, central/left, no radiation.  
SOB only on exertion (e.g. stairs), none at rest. Talking in full sentences on phone. No haemoptysis, no wheeze reported, no ankle swelling, no orthopnoea/PND. Eating/drinking ok though ↓ appetite, no GI upset.

Works on medical ward, lots of URTI exposure. Says last winter “this turned into pneumonia” and usual GP “always gives antibiotics early”. Saw another GP ~5 days ago at different clinic, told “probably viral” and no abx – unhappy about this, wants “strong antibiotics like azithro or even IV if needed”.

COVID: RAT x2 negative (day 3, day 6). No PCR, no CXR yet.

Red flag screen (phone only):  
No resting SOB, no central crushing chest pain, no calf pain/swelling, no haemoptysis, no confusion. Not pregnant.

Phone “exam”:  
Voice a bit tired but not breathless, full sentences, occasional dry cough heard. No obvious distress. Can’t get obs/O2 over phone.

Social – brief: share house, worried about rent if off work >1–2 wks → reason for Centrelink. No partner mentioned.

Bit demanding re forms: repeatedly “I need the Centrelink paperwork done today, I can’t wait weeks” and “I know how this goes, I look after these patients all the time”. Explained limitations of phone consult, need for CXR/obs etc before long-term capacity forms. She not thrilled but stayed polite enough.

Impression (provisional):  
?Atypical community-acquired pneumonia / LRTI rather than simple viral URTI now given:  
- cough + systemic sx >7 days  
- low-grade fevers, exertional SOB  
- mild pleuritic-type pain  
- exposure in hospital environment  
No obvious red flags by phone but limited assessment. DDx: viral LRTI incl COVID/other resp virus, early bacterial CAP, ?pertussis, PE unlikely from hx.

Plan (a bit out of order):

– Scripts:  
• Doxycycline 100 mg PO BD x 7 days (PBS). Counselling re upright with water, food if nausea, photosensitivity – discussed briefly.  
• Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN fever/pain (max 4 g/24 h).

She initially pushing for “azithro or IV like we do on the ward”. Explained outpatient mild case → oral doxy first line, IV not indicated if stable and tolerating PO. Some back and forth, eventually accepted.

– Ix (same day if possible):  
• CXR PA/LAT – r/o pneumonia/assess extent.  
• COVID PCR + resp viral panel (if lab does this) given hospital exposure.  
• FBC, CRP, U&E, LFTs baseline + inflammatory markers.

Explained need for objective evidence before filling Centrelink disability / capacity forms. She asked “Can’t you just assume it’s pneumonia and sign it?” → explained medico-legal + standard of care. Eventually agreed.

– Certificates / forms:  
• Medical certificate provided for absence from work 22/11/25–28/11/25 for LRTI / probable atypical pneumonia.  
• Centrelink medical form: NOT completed today. To be done after review with results + response to tx (3–5 days). Documented that complex forms not done on brief phone-only consult without exam/obs. She unhappy but accepted short delay.

– Safety net:  
Advised ED/urgent review if SOB at rest / unable to speak full sentences, high fevers not settling, chest pain at rest, palpitations, confusion/syncope, haemoptysis. RTC if any deterioration.

– Follow-up:  
Booked F2F review 2–3 days (or earlier if worse) to:  
• check vitals, O2 sats, chest exam  
• review CXR + bloods  
• confirm dx and decide on duration off work  
• complete Centrelink form if ongoing functional impairment and pneumonia confirmed.

If can’t get in here, advised can see local GP/after-hours with same plan once results available on system.

She also briefly raised “months of exhaustion from double shifts / maybe burnout and mental health certificate”. Advised separate longer consult once acute illness settled – not addressed today due to time. She a bit frustrated about needing multiple visits.

Bulk billed (MBS 91809 – phone consult <20 mins).  
09:34 – note finished, may need to recheck dates at review (Centrelink form likely next week, not today).
