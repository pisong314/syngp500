RACF round – Rm xx  

76M – review low mood / tired  

HPI  
Says “bit flat last couple of months” not all day every day still enjoys footy otherwise “can’t be bothered”. Sleep broken (night obs/meds). Appetite ok no wt loss per staff. No ↑ anxiety.  
Some passive death thoughts “wouldn’t matter if I didn’t wake up” but denies active SI/plan “I wouldn’t do anything silly just sick of being here”.  
↑ forgetful re meds “I keep forgetting… sometimes I just say I’ve had them so they’ll go away”. RACF chart → multiple refused metoprolol this month.  
No chest pain no palps. Mild postural LH only if up too quick. No syncope. Baseline mild DOE only. No oedema.  

PMHx (brief)  
High‑grade AV block → dual chamber PPM 18/12/23. No known HF/AF/MI in file.  

Meds (RACF chart)  
Metoprolol succ 23.75 mg mane (often refused)  
Perindopril 5 mg mane  
Aspirin 100 mg mane  
Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte

O/E (RACF obs today)  
BP 128/72 HR 62 (paced) RR16 T 36.7 SpO₂ 97% RA  
Looks thin but NAD sitting in chair. PPM site well healed. HS dual no oedema. Chest clear. A+O to person/place, off by 1d for date. Mildly withdrawn but engages, affect slightly ↓ but reactive. No psychosis.  

PHQ‑9 = 9 (mild)  

Ix  
Old ECG 3/12 ago: AS‑VP ~60 no ischaemia.  
PPM check 9/12 ago → now overdue (was due 12/12).  
No recent bloods (last ~10/12, U&E/LFT nl, TSH not done).  

A  
1) Mild depressive sx in RACF context + bereavement + loss of independence. Passive death wishes only, no active SI/plan.  
2) High‑grade AV block s/p dual‑chamber PPM – clinically stable.  
3) Poor med adherence (esp β‑blocker) → ↑ risk arrhythmia/cardiac decomp.  
4) ?Early cognitive impairment vs age/low mood – needs formal screen later.  

P  
Mood  
- Given mild sx + adherence issues → no ADx yet.  
- Encourage engagement with RACF activities (nursing/lifestyle staff to prompt, esp footy / group activities).  
- Safety: pt agrees to tell staff / ring bell if mood worse or any SI. Staff to call GP/on‑call if concern.  
- Recheck mood + cognition 4–6/52 (book longer appt).  

Cardiac / PPM  
- Reiterated importance of taking cardiac meds and PPM f/up “otherwise you could end up crook and back in hospital” – pt reluctantly agrees to “try for a month”.  
- RN:  
  → continue to offer meds, document refusals, notify GP if pattern ↑  
  → simple explanations, avoid overwhelming him with multiple instructions.  
- Ask RACF to arrange cardiology/device clinic appt (nearby public hosp) for routine PPM interrogation ASAP (aim ≤1–2/12). Request mid‑morning slot + facility transport if poss (poor early‑am attendance hx).  

Bloods ordered (RACF collection ≤1/52):  
- FBC, U&E, LFT, CMP  
- TSH  
- B12, folate  

Cognition / behaviour  
- Note pattern of missed meds + declined external appts.  
- Involve daughter/EPOA in med + appt planning (RN to update her, consider reminder call day prior to cardio appt).  
- Formal cognitive screen (MMSE/MoCA) next longer review.  

F/up  
- Routine RACF GP review ~4/52 or earlier if mood ↓ / any SI, syncope/pre‑syncope, chest pain, SOB, or ongoing significant med refusal.  
- Review bloods when back and reconsider ADx / thyroid / cognitive workup.

RN rang re meds – pt took all AM meds today after discussion “I’ll give it a go for a bit”. No acute mood change. Plan unchanged.
