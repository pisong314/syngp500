Reason  
Resident asking R/V re “different pains inside my head and tummy”  
Med check  
Known infrarenal AAA  

ID  
84yo man long term RACF retired construction worker  

HPC  
Abdo pain  
- ~3/52 hx vague central/lower abdo aching  
- Worse when twisting in bed not clearly exertional  
- Nil sudden onset nil radiation to back  
- Nil vomit nil PR bleed bowels abit sluggish baseline  
- Appetite slightly ↓ but still eating most meals  
- Wonders if new margarine upsetting stomach  

Head

- Nil thunderclap nil early am vomit  

Peripheral  
- Occ sharp “jab” L calf when moving in bed settles quickly  
- Nil rest pain nil colour change nil ulcers  
- Mobility v limited uses 4WW with staff  

AAA context  
- Aware of “bulge in big artery”  
- Nil acute severe abdo or back pain nil collapse  
- Mild usual postural light headed only  
- Staff: nil fevers chills rigors  
- Mild wt loss ~1–2kg over 3/12 consistent frailty  

Meds / adherence  
- In RACF meds given by staff  
- Pt: “I keep forgetting my tablets but the girls here keep shoving them at me”  
- Staff report occasional refusal of AM meds few times per wk  
- Pt ran out of “heart tablets” prior to RACF not on them for ages pre admission  

Specialist f/u  
- Did not attend planned vascular clinic pre RACF entry last yr  
- Nil recent vascular R/V  

PMHx  
- Infrarenal AAA US 18/08/23 5.3cm plan vascular clinic and 6–12/12 surveillance pt did not attend  
- CAD NSTEMI 2017 PCI x1  
- Ischaemic CVA 2020 mild residual L arm weakness  
- Hx infective endocarditis native valve 2019 IV abx no surgery  
- HTN HLD  
- Ex smoker >40 pack yr quit ~10yrs ago  
- Mild cognitive impairment ?early dementia  

Meds (RACF chart key)  
- Aspirin 100mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
- Perindopril 5mg mane  
- Metoprolol succinate 23.75mg mane  
- PRN paracetamol 1g q6h  
- Bowel regimen vit D PRN oxazepam  

Allergies  
NKDA  

Social  
Widowed in RACF daughter EPOA visits ~fortnightly  
Needs assist for ADLs ↓ vision some hearing imp  

Exam  
Obs (RACF) BP 138/72 HR 76 reg RR 18 SpO2 97% RA Temp 36.7C  

Gen frail elderly man NAD talking coherant  
CVS HS dual soft ES murmur aortic area known nil new murmur nil oedema feet warm CR ~3s pulses DP/PT difficult to palp  
Resp chest clear  
Abdo soft mildly distended non tender nil guarding or rigidity nil palpable mass AAA not clearly palpable no pulsatile tender mass BS present  
Neuro A+O to person place not exact date speech fluent CN grossly intact power 4+/5 L arm (old) 5/5 elsewhere gait not fully assessed transfers with 4WW + 1 assist slow stable nil new focal signs  
Skin legs intact nil ulcers nil IE stigmata  

Ix  
To be arranged via RACF / practice  
- Abdo USS AAA surveillance urgent but non emergent within 1–2/52 “known AAA 5.3cm 2023 new intermittent abdo pain pls compare”  
- Bloods FBC U&E LFT CRP ESR lipids HbA1c TFTs  

If fevers or acute deterioration RACF to call GP / ambulance for urgent R/V ± ED transfer blood/urine cultures if concern sepsis IE mycotic aneurysm  

Assessment  
1. Intermittent non specific abdo pain in pt with known infrarenal AAA 5.3cm 2023  
   - Haemodynamically stable abdo soft NT  
   - Nil red flags for rupture today nil sudden severe pain nil hypotension nil collapse  
   - Given size + >2yrs since last imaging high priority for repeat USS ± vascular R/V  
   - Mycotic aneurysm / IE extension less likely currently afebrile systemically well  

2. Intermittent “head pressure”  
   - Likely benign multifactorial ?tension type ?age related cerebrovascular change mild dehydration  
   - Nil red flag features nil new neuro deficit  

3. Polyvascular disease CAD CVA AAA very high CV risk  
   - On aspirin statin ACEi beta blocker aim 2° prevention symptom control realistic targets given age frailty  

4. Hx infective endocarditis  
   - Nil clinical evidence recurrence  

5. Med adherence issues  
   - Now mostly supervised in RACF intermittent refusal persists pattern of poor engagement with specialist care  

Plan  
AAA / abdo pain  
- No ED transfer today stable pain mild chronic exam benign  
- Arrange abdo USS as above  
- RACF nursing  
  - Daily obs x5/7  
  - Escalate to ambulance / ED if sudden severe abdo or back pain collapse syncope new hypotension tachycardia acute confusion fever rigors or new focal abdo tenderness  
- Analgesia paracetamol 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h avoid NSAIDs  

Headache  
- Monitor only no imaging today  
- Use PRN paracetamol  
- If new neuro sx eg weakness speech/vision change sudden worst ever headache repeated vomit → call ambulance ?stroke  

Meds / CV risk  
- Continue aspirin 100mg mane atorvastatin 40mg nocte perindopril 5mg mane metoprolol 23.75mg mane  
- Brief education re importance for heart stroke AAA risk pt: “I know but some mornings I just cant be bothered”  
- Ask nursing to note med refusals and reasons offer with food gentle encouragement not force  

Medication changes today  
- Nil changes to regular cardiac meds  
- Confirmed paracetamol PRN charted to max 4g/24h (previously written but dose limit not clearly documented on RACF chart now clarified)  

Infection / IE risk  
- Nil abx  
- Staff to watch for new fevers rigors sweats unexplained deterioration  

Logistics / family  
- RACF RN to book USS and transport  
- To inform daughter/EPOA once imaging done for vascular f/u likely telehealth or hospital clinic rather than multiple community appts  

F/U  
- GP R/V in RACF 1–2/52 or earlier if USS results back  
- ED if sudden deterioration as above  
- Issues to address at later long appt with daughter present  
  - Full med review including psychotropics bowel regimen  
  - Cognition formal screen goals of care ACD  

Patient advised to return / staff to call if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain or confusion  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Chan – pathology request forms e-sent to local lab RACF to bleed pt next routine round lipids HbA1c added as last set >18/12 ago trend needed for CV risk review]
