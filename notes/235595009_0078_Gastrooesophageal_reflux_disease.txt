54F, office admin, known GORD ~3 yrs  

Came in mainly “to go over all the tests and make sure it’s not cancer”. Ongoing reflux, epigastric burning x last 2–3/12, worse at night, after coffee/tomato meals. No dysphagia/odynophagia, no wt loss, no vomiting, no melaena/PR bleed. Bowels OK, appetite OK. Sleep disturbed a couple of nights/week by reflux.  

Has been taking Nexium 20mg now and then (OTC) + Gaviscon PRN, not regular. No NSAIDs. Non-smoker, minimal EtOH.  

Very anxious re Barrett’s/oesophageal Ca – has been googling. Repeatedly asking about CT “to be sure”. Worried sparkling water + standing desk causing damage.  

Obs today: BP 128/76, HR 78 reg, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA, BMI 27. Looks well, mildly anxious. Abd: soft, mild epigastric tenderness only, no masses, no guarding. No pallor/jaundice.  

Results (today’s review – from last visit orders):  
- FBC: Hb 135, rest normal  
- U&E, LFT, lipase: all WNL  
- H. pylori breath test: NEG  
- Fasting glucose/lipids: chol 5.4 borderline, rest unremarkable (not really discussed today, to do later)  

Impression:  
- GORD flare, H. pylori neg, no red flags, low suspicion malignancy  
- Health anxiety driving repeated reassurance seeking  

Plan:  
- Explained results, reassured re low Ca risk given age, normal Hb, no alarm sx.  
- Start structured PPI: esomeprazole 20 mg mane, 30–60 mins before breakfast, daily x 4–8 weeks (instead of PRN). PBS script given.  
- Continue Gaviscon PRN.  
- Basic lifestyle advice re reflux (avoid late large meals, trigger foods, raise head of bed, wt reduction). Kept brief.  
- Discussed that CT not indicated for GORD, endoscopy only if poor response to PPI or if red flag sx develop.  
- Red flags explained briefly (dysphagia, food sticking, vomiting esp blood, black stools, wt loss) – told to see GP/ED if occur.  
- Acknowledged health anxiety, suggested longer appt to talk about this and review lipids, possible psych/CBT referral – pt interested.  

Follow up: review 4/52 to assess response to PPI + discuss cholesterol/anxiety (book long appt). RTC earlier if worse / red flag sx.

Rechecked labs – no anaemia, LFTs still normal. No change to plan above.
