32F teacher – f/up rash + gut sx / ?food intolerance  

HPI  
Ongoing intermittent itchy rash forearms + ant neck x ~2/12. Comes/goes. Flares a few hrs post certain meals. Past 2/52 ~4–5 eps. No facial swell, no SOB, no wheeze, no throat tightness. No new meds/soaps etc per pt. Says “seems to blow up on nights I’ve had pasta or takeaway”. School hand sanitiser stings if already rashy.  

Longstanding IBS-type sx – bloating, crampy lower abdo pain, variable stool. No wt loss, no PR bleed, no noct diarrhoea, no fevers. No FHx bowel ca per old notes. Pt notes clearer link now with wheat (pasta/bread), onion/garlic, some fruit. “Feel foggy and wiped out on bad gut days”.  

Since last review 3/52 ago has done rough food/sx diary + ↓pasta, apples, onion/garlic → ~30–40% better bloating + fewer rash days. Wants more structured plan, “don’t want to cut whole food groups for no reason”.  

Meds  
- COCP (EE/levonorgestrel) stable  
- PRN simethicone OTC – some benefit  
NKDA. No prev anaphylaxis.  

Exam  
Obs ok: BP 112/70 HR 74 afeb SpO2 99% RA BMI 23  
Skin: faint erythematous macular rash L forearm flexor, non-vesic, non-purpuric, no warmth, no angioedema, no mucosal inv.  
Abdo: soft, mildly bloated, NT, no masses, BS N. Chest clear.  

Impression  
1) Suspected food intolerance / IBS-type functional GI disorder  
   - Sx pattern (bloating + “brain fog” + mild rash) temporally related to high-FODMAP foods (wheat, onion/garlic, some fruit).  
   - No features IgE-mediated allergy (no urticaria with systemic sx, no anaphylaxis).  
   - No red flags for IBD/malignancy/systemic autoimmune at present.  

2) IBS-type functional GI disorder – ongoing but improving with informal dietary mods  

3) Mild intermittent eczematous/irritant rash forearms/neck  
   - Likely irritant + background sensitivity (hand sanitiser/soaps) ± flaring with systemic sx. No infection, no serious derm.  

Plan  
- Explained likely food intolerance vs allergy (dose-dependent, non-IgE, no anaphylaxis) in brief. Advised no point doing IgE/skin tests/breath tests currently.  
- Start structured low FODMAP-style exclusion 4–6/52 as diagnostic trial (NOT long-term strict).  
- Referral APD (IBS/low FODMAP exp) – for detailed plan + reintro phase + nutrition adequacy.  
- Continue food/sx diary (meals, bloating, stool, rash, “brain fog”).  
- If no sig improvement after ~4/52 good adherence → reconsider dx, poss further Ix / GI review. If better → graded reintro with APD to ID specific triggers, aim least restrictive diet.  
- Meds:  
  - Continue PRN simethicone.  
  - Antispasmodic (e.g. hyoscine butylbromide) discussed, pt prefers wait and see diet effect.  
- Skin:  
  - Likely irritant/eczema. Use bland moisturiser/soap substitute, minimise harsh sanitiser where poss.  
  - Short course OTC hydrocortisone 1% BD 5–7/7 during flares ok (avoid prolonged use esp face/neck).  
- No new bloods today – prev coeliac serol, FBC, CRP last year all N; no new red flags.  

Safety net  
- Red flag counsel: RTC/ED if wt loss, PR bleed, persistent vomiting, fevers, severe abdo pain, or any anaphylaxis sx (facial/tongue swell, trouble breathing, throat tight, generalised hives).  

F/up  
- Review 5–6/52 (long appt) after diet trial + APD review.  
- Can book separate appt re broader IBS mgmt (stress, work triggers, meds) – not done today (time).
