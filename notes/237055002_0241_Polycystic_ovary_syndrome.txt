Rash under breasts groin  
Brief DM PCOS check  

Pt  
32yo South Asian F retail worker walk in  
Says "Ive only got 10 minutes just this rash need to get back to work" declined longer r/v  

Context / access  
Works long irregular shifts finds it hard to get to appts fasting bloods  
Local path opens early pt can get there pre work  
Cost a concern for multiple visits so trying to bundle tests next r/v  
No car relies on husband for lifts so prefers early slots  

HPC

Feet brief  
Intact skin nil ulcers obvious infx  

A  
1 Intertriginous candidal dermatitis 2° moisture friction obesity T2DM warm work environment tight clothing  
   Contact dermatitis from new washing powder poss contrib but less likely  
   Nil systemic features or signs of bacterial cellulitis abscess  

2 PCOS + metabolic syndrome picture T2DM NAFLD obesity suboptimal monitoring ↑CV risk needs structured r/v when more time  

3 T2DM control unknown adherence suboptimal high risk ethnicity + PCOS  
   Needs HbA1c renal fx lipids etc complication screen  

P  
Discussed limited time today prioritised rash + ordering baseline bloods  

# Rash – candidal intertrigo  
- Clotrimazole 1% cream apply thin layer to affected areas BD x at least 2/52 continue 3–5/7 after clear  
- Hydrocortisone 1% cream OD to itchy inflamed areas max 5–7/7 then stop avoid broken skin  
- Advice keep folds clean dry pat dry after showers can use cool hairdryer avoid heavy moisturisers in folds loose cotton underwear bras  
- Can use non medicated powder sparingly later not at same time as creams  

Safety net  
Warned re red flags rapidly worsening redness pain heat swelling fever or if area becomes hot tender → urgent r/v or ED if after hours  
If not improving in 1–2/52 may need oral antifungal swab  

# T2DM / PCOS / NAFLD – brief today  
Explained link PCOS insulin resistance DM NAFLD ↑CV risk pt mainly focused on rash today "can we just fix the rash"  
Negotiated plan for staged workup given shift work + transport limits  

Ix ordered fasting pre work at local path (pt agreed as opens early)  
- FBE  
- U&E eGFR  
- LFTs  
- HbA1c  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BSL  
- TSH  

Will check OCP brand next visit more detailed PCOS r/v incl cycle hx endometrial risk mental health wt mgmt  

Meds  
Discussed adherence difficulties w TDS metformin at work  
Plan switch to modified release to simplify once bloods back  
For now advised aim for at least BD w breakfast dinner lunch dose if able  
Flagged probable change → metformin XR nocte next r/v to ↑ adherence PBS ok  
No other med changes today  

# Lifestyle (very brief)  
Given time + resource limits kept simple  
Encouraged small ↑activity eg 10–15min brisk walk on breaks stairs where poss  
Diet small swaps ↓sugary drinks high GI snacks  
Discuss dietitian ref at future longer appt pt open "not today" aware local dietitian wait ~6/52  

Follow up / access  
Asked to book longer double appt in 1–2/52 ideally early morning before shift to  
- r/v rash response  
- r/v bloods HbA1c LFT lipids renal  
- more complete DM check feet BP wt  
- PCOS longer discussion contraception fertility long term risk  

Noted pt time poor may miss appts set up recall + SMS reminder system  
Advised needs DM r/v at least 3–6/12 even if busy  

Pt left in hurry states understands creams agrees to fasting bloods + f/u  

[Addendum 24/11/25 16:10 – Dr K Lee]
