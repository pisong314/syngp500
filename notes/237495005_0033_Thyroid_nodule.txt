Review – thyroid lump / results  

52F, office admin, here to go over thyroid bloods + US from last visit. Says lump on R side neck has been there “maybe a year or two, I nearly didn’t come back, I don’t like making a fuss”. Thinks it’s a bit bigger last 6–12/12, not painful. No trouble swallowing or breathing, no voice change.  

Recently a bit “jittery”, “heart flutters when I’m just sitting at my desk”, feels hotter than others at work, lost ~3–4 kg without trying. Blames “too much coffee and the office aircon being weird”. No diarrhoea, no obvious eye issues. Very reluctant re meds/surgery: “I’d rather not do anything drastic if we can help it.”  

O/E (brief – focused):  
BP 128/76, HR 96 regular, afebrile, BMI ~25.  
Neck: visible slight fullness R anterior neck, solitary ~3 cm firm smooth mobile thyroid nodule R lobe, non-tender, no obvious other thyromegaly, no palpable nodes.  
Fine tremor hands, brisk but symmetrical reflexes. No exophthalmos. CVS HS dual, mild tachy. Chest clear.  

Results (from last week, checked today – ?SNP):  
- TSH <0.01 mIU/L (low)  
- FT4 mildly ↑ (exact number not on summary screen, flagged high)  
- FT3 ↑  
- TSH receptor Ab negative  
- TPO Ab negative  

Thyroid US:  
R lobe 32 mm solid, well circumscribed, mostly isoechoic nodule, ↑ vascularity, no microcalcifications, no suspicious cervical nodes. Rest of thyroid looks suppressed. Radiologist rec: radionuclide thyroid scan to assess function.  

Impression today: solitary R thyroid nodule (~3.2 cm) with biochemical hyperthyroidism – likely toxic adenoma rather than Graves (TSH-R Ab neg, no eye signs, US c/w single “hot” nodule). Mild symptomatic hyperthyroidism but stable, no AF, no HF, no compressive Sx. Pt tends to minimise: “If the scan is a hassle I might just leave it for a bit.”  

Plan (a bit all over as discussed):  
- Order radionuclide thyroid scan (Tc or I‑123) – to confirm hot nodule + suppression of rest of gland. Request done today to local nuclear med service.  
- Repeat TFTs (TSH, FT4, FT3) in ~6/52 or earlier if we start antithyroid meds. Path form printed.  
- Explained FNA usually not done if clearly functioning nodule (very low malignancy risk) – will revisit only if scan not diagnostic.  

Symptom control:  
- Discussed beta blocker for tremor/palpitations. Initially reluctant to take anything: “I was hoping it would just settle on its own.”  
- After talk re risks of untreated hyperthyroidism (rhythm problems, bones, etc.) she agreed to trial low dose.  
- Rx: Propranolol 10 mg PO tds PRN, may take regularly tds if needed. Aim HR ~70–80 if tolerated. No asthma, no bradycardia history. Warned re fatigue, cold hands/feet, vivid dreams, to stop and seek review if wheeze/SOB or dizziness.  

Disease-directed (flagged but deferred):  
- Briefly outlined that if scan confirms toxic adenoma, usual path is:  
   • Carbimazole short–medium term to get euthyroid  
   • Then definitive Rx – likely radioiodine, or surgery (R hemithyroidectomy) if preferred/indicated.  
- Given time + her hesitancy, will hold off starting carbimazole until scan result and longer discussion. Reassured most toxic nodules benign and treatable but shouldn’t ignore.  

Safety/Follow-up:  
- Asked to cut back caffeine for now.  
- Advised to seek urgent review/ED if chest pain, severe palpitations, SOB, syncope or rapidly enlarging/painful neck swelling.  
- Gave written info link re thyroid nodules/overactive thyroid.  
- Plan review in 3–4/52 (or sooner if scan done earlier) to:  
   • Review scan + any repeat TFTs  
   • Decide on starting carbimazole  
   • Go through definitive options (RAI vs surgery) – may need long appt.  
- Suggested bringing husband next time to help with decisions.  

Pt states she understands but still minimising, agreed (somewhat reluctantly) to proceed with scan and to try propranolol.  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L. Chan – spoke briefly to nuclear med over phone, they can fit scan within next 2–3 weeks, no special prep apart from usual. Left msg with pt to book directly, reminded importance of attending. Will re-check TFTs at follow-up as above. Reviewed and okayed by Dr M. Thompson.]
