Reason for visit  
Req ref to specialist re “metabolic syndrome” T2DM  

Subjective / functional Hx  
Pt 68F Anglo Aus retired admin lives with husband drives independent ADLs IADLs  
Known T2DM ~10yrs HTN hyperlipid osteoporosis metabolic syndrome  

Main concern re long term function kidneys eyes feet wants to “get a referral to a specialist about this metabolic syndrome and my sugar”  
Says taking meds daily  
Energy ↓ last few mths feels more tired on longer walks eg walking dog 20–30min most days in flat area able but slows on inclines no SOB no claudication  
Nil polyuria polydipsia visual blurring chest pain focal neuro sx  
No recent hypos gait steady nil falls transfers indep  

Home BSL log brought in  
Fasting 6–8 occasional post prandial 8–9 after larger meals  
Chemist BP “around 130 something”  

Diet functional impact  
Cooks at home traditional diet has ↑ intake “low fat biscuits” snacks  
Concern re town water “tasting funny” ?effect on sugar  

Social concise  
Retired couple Bendigo region good support non smoker ETOH 1–2 std drinks 2–3 nights/wk  
Walks dog most days activity ↓ in cold weather

Physical / functional exam  
General well appearing ambulates indep normal gait stride length WFL no aid

Balance static standing feet together steady 10s tandem not tested today  

CVS HS dual nil murmur nil oedema  
Resp clear bilat

Feet skin intact nil ulcers colour temp WNL cap refill <2s  
Monofilament intact standard sites bilat  
Pedal pulses palpable  

MSK  
Mild thoracic kyphosis posture slightly flexed but functionally compensates  
Nil spinal tenderness hip ROM WFL for walking stairs basic ADLs  
No knee exam today (pt mentioned mild stiffness only at end of consult asked to book longer r/v)  

Recent Ix (6/12 ago)  
HbA1c 7.2%  
Lipids TC 4.6 LDL 2.2 HDL 1.1 TG 2.0

Urine ACR normal

DXA 18/12 ago osteoporosis FN + LS stable vs prior  

Assessment  
1 Metabolic syndrome T2DM HTN dyslipidaemia central obesity  
   Overall mod control high CV risk functional status currently good walking tolerance ok ADLs indep but BMI 31 and pt highly concerned re future complications  
2 T2DM stable control last HbA1c 7.2% nil known microvascular comps feet ok renal ok vision r/v due ~3/12  
3 HTN well controlled  
4 Osteoporosis DXA proven on alendronate >3yrs functionally nil fx gait stable  
5 Education / expectations pt very engaged wants clarity “do I really need a specialist or can we just keep doing what we’re doing”  

Plan  

# Function & activity  
Encouraged gradual ↑ walking aiming ≥150min/wk mod intensity  
Discussed pacing re fatigue short rests during longer walks  
Encouraged add light WB ex eg stairs gentle sit↔stand program at home 2–3x/wk to support bone health LE strength  
Formal HEP to be set up next longer appt or via practice nurse physio if pt keen  

# Metabolic syndrome / T2DM / CV risk  
Explained metabolic syndrome cluster and link to heart stroke kidney eye risk  
Reassured town water taste unlikely to affect BSLs  
Discussed that “low fat” biscuits still high sugar refined carbs advised ↓ frequency  

Referrals  
– Endocrinology ref to regional centre for comprehensive metabolic r/v  
  Include hx meds HbA1c trend lipids BP osteoporosis hx BMI functional status  
  Consider SGLT2i or GLP‑1 RA esp if wt loss and CV benefit indicated  

Ix ordered today  
– HbA1c  
– Fasting lipids  
– UEC LFT  
– Urine ACR  
– Fasting glucose  

Meds  
Continue current regimen pending results and endo input  
Reinforced gliclazide timing with meals hypo sx discussed brief pt reports nil hypos  

# Osteoporosis / MSK  
Continue alendronate weekly with standard instructions Ca/Vit D  
Maintain WB ex as above  
Plan repeat DXA ~6/12 (2yr mark) to arrange at later visit  
Knee stiffness mentioned briefly likely OA pattern but not assessed fully today asked pt to book longer r/v for detailed MSK + functional gait/strength assessment and tailored ex program  

# Education  
Discussed kidney eye nerve risk in context of current control emphasised regular checks BP bloods feet eyes  
Explained role of endocrinologist vs GP ongoing shared care  
Pt verbalised understanding happy to see specialist  

Billing  
Standard consult item 23 bulk billed  

Follow up  
R/v 4/52  
– discuss pathology  
– review BSL log BP  
– check endo appt details  
– more detailed wt management and functional ex plan consider GPMP/TCA with dietitian + physio  

Earlier if sx of hypo/hyperglycaemia chest pain SOB neuro sx falls
