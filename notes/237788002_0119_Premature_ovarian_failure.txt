31F Yolŋu – known POI – review  

CC: “hot flushes, mood all over, down below really dry + sore”  

HPC  
POI dx here 2021 (FSH menopausal range x2, amenorrhoea >12/12, not on hormones now)  
Amenorrhoea “>1 yr, maybe 2”  
Vasomotor sx: “hot rushes” multiple/day + nocturnal, wakes “sweaty then cold”, sleep poor  
Mood: ↑irritable, tearful, “flat + tired”, no active SI, no self-harm thoughts voiced today  
Vaginal: dryness + dyspareunia “scratchy and sore so I just avoid it”, no abn PV bleed, no discharge, no malodour, no dysuria  
Sexually active 1 male partner, condoms sometimes, thinks “eggs finished so can’t get pregnant”  

PMHx  
POI (spontaneous). No known VTE, breast ca, CVD.  
No reg meds. No known drug allergies.  

O/E  
Obs ok: BP 112/72, HR 78, afebrile, BMI ~23. Looks tired, a bit teary but settled. No focal findings. Pelvic not done – pt prefers “next time” and no red flags.  

Impression  
1) Premature ovarian insufficiency – currently off hormone tx → ↑CVD + osteoporosis risk  
2) Menopausal sx (vasomotor, mood, vaginal dryness) 2° POI, impacting QOL + sleep  
3) Contraception need – very low but not zero fertility, currently unreliable method  
4) Mood disturbance likely multifactorial, no acute MH red flags today  

Plan  
– Restart systemic oestrogen + progestogen, use COCP as HRT + contraception  
  • EE/levonorgestrel 30/150 mcg 1 tab PO mane CONTINUOUS (no pill-free wk)  
  • Explained daily use, start next pack straight away, likely help flushes + bone/heart + contraception  
  • Counselled re common SEs + red flag sx (chest pain, SOB, unilateral leg swelling, severe HA/visual change → ED)  

– Vaginal dryness  
  • Adv regular non-hormonal vaginal moisturiser 2–3x/wk + water-based lubricant with sex  
  • Consider topical vaginal oestrogen at review if still very symptomatic  

– Ix ordered today (baseline in POI on hormones)  
  • FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, HbA1c  
  • Vit D, Ca  
  • DEXA – discuss + refer next longer appt (bone health, logistics)  

– Brief counselling  
  • Clarified POI ≠ 0% pregnancy → COCP covers contraception  
  • Needs hormone tx until ~50–51 “keep taking this till about 50” – repeated in simple terms  
  • AHW involvement offered for follow-up + education – pt agreeable  
  • Prefers female GP for pelvic exam / possible LNG-IUD later  

Safety net  
RTC/ED if heavy PV bleed, post-coital bleed, new bleed after long amenorrhoea, or COCP red flag sx, or mood worsens / any SI.  

F/U  
Book double appt 3–4/52 with female GP + AHW  
– review COCP response/SEs  
– review bloods  
– arrange DEXA + detailed bone risk discussion  
– explore fertility wishes + possible fert. specialist referral  
– more thorough MH review (K10/DASS, consider counselling)  
– pelvic exam ± start vaginal oestrogen if still symptomatic  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Brown – pathology not back yet, recall set for 4/52 review. Previous note said amenorrhoea >4/12 – correction: now >12/12 by hx today.]
