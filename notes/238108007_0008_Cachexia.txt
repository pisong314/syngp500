Ix  
Nil new tests today given known advanced illness no red flags for urgent imaging  
Prev wt trend as above  
Plan to update pall care re current sx rather than further dx workup  

Assessment  
1 Mechanical LBP on background severe frailty cachexia  
   - No red flags today nil trauma nil focal vertebral tenderness nil cauda equina features nil systemic infective sx  
   - Likely 2° deconditioning ↓ core strength altered posture mattress seating  

2 Established cachexia SNOMED 238108007 in setting advanced life limiting illness  
   - Progressive wt + muscle loss poor appetite  
   - Nil clear reversible causes today nil sig nausea mucositis dysphagia constipation uncontrolled pain or major depn  

3 Multiple additional minor concerns shoulder pain skin lesion ear toenail issue sleep vitamins knee etc not fully addressed today will need longer r/v  

Plan  

1 LBP  
Education  
Reassured nil current signs cord compression or spinal emergency explained contribution muscle wasting deconditioning new mattress recliner use  

Analgesia  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1g qid max 4g/24h advised to take more regularly for few days then PRN  
- Discussed option add low dose opioid if pain still limiting function at next r/v given frailty constipation risk  

Non pharm  
- Encouraged short frequent walks around house/yard with stick avoid prolonged sitting esp recliner  
- Simple lumbar stretches given handout from usual back pain template  
- Offered physio re core strengthening home based if possible via community pall care services pt + wife agreeable  
- Suggested adjust pillows support on new mattress avoid very soft seating  

Red flags advice  
Advised urgent GP/ED if new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia loss bladder or bowel control severe unremitting night pain or sig fall  

2 Cachexia appetite family concerns  
Education with pt + wife  
Explained cachexia part of underlying malignancy process not simply "not trying hard enough to eat" wt loss may not be reversible focus comfort enjoyment of food rather than numbers calories  
Reassured he is not "causing his own death" by low intake gave wife permission not to force food  

Practical  
- Encourage small frequent snacks rather than large meals  
- High protein high energy drinks eg Sustagen/Ensure style as meal replacement when low appetite  
- Try reduce strong cooking smells lids exhaust fan cold foods if better tolerated  

Pharm  
- Trial dexamethasone 2mg PO mane x5/7 for appetite energy  
  Plan phone or nurse r/v after 5/7 if clear benefit consider continue lowest effective dose up to ~2/52 then aim cease  
  Discussed potential SE mood change insomnia reflux fluid retention ↑BGL benefit usually short term  

Monitoring  
Will avoid frequent formal weighs per pt preference use function clothing fit clinical impression instead  

3 Coordination supports  
- Note entered EMR will send brief update to pall care team re LBP flare steroid trial physio request via HealthLink  
- Encouraged wife to contact community nurse if concerns ↓ oral intake nausea constipation new or ↑ pain  

4 Other issues on list  
Explained time limit today need separate longer appt to address properly  
Plan  
- Book 30min long appt next 1–2/52 to review shoulder pain skin lesion ear toenail sleep vitamins knee etc  
- Asked pt to bring same list to prioritise next time  

Follow up  
- Nurse or phone r/v ~5/7 re dexamethasone effect appetite energy SE  
- Face to face r/v 2/52 for  
  • reassess back pain overall sx control  
  • review steroid trial continue vs cease  
  • long appt for remaining concerns  

Safety net
