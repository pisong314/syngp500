58F MND  

CC: wt loss ↓, poor appetite, wants “steroids to put weight back on”, review bloods  

HPI  
Known MND ~18/12, bulbar + limb. Progressive wt loss last 2–3/12 ~5–6kg (55→~49kg, 165cm). Poor PO intake, early satiety, “nothing tastes right”. ↑ effort to eat, fatigues w meals. Dysphagia – coughs w thin fluids, avoids meat/bread, mainly soft foods/soups, slow eating, upright. Sometimes skips meals “too much effort / feel sick”. Partner says tiny portions. No N/V, no abdo pain, bowels ok, no PR bleed. No sig fevers/NS.  

Mood low re disease + wt loss, tearful but future oriented (“want proper treatment, feeding tubes, whatever it takes”). No S/H thoughts voiced.  

Pt v directive, challenging re limits of tx. Wants scans/PET, “steroids like cancer pts”. Under tertiary MND clinic – letters note progressive disease, MND cachexia, bulbar involvement. Neuro suggested GP consider appetite support incl low-dose steroid trial + AD (mirtazapine) + SP review.  

Meds  
Riluzole 50mg BD  
Baclofen 10mg TDS  
Paracetamol 1g QID PRN  
Senna/Coloxyl PRN  
NKDA  

O/E (focused)  
Thin/cachectic. Vitals stable (BP 108/68, HR 88, afeb, SpO₂ 96% RA). Wt 49.1kg (BMI ~18). Mild dysarthria, occasional choke w water. Chest clear, abdo soft NT. Neuro ∆ consistent w known MND.  

Ix (today’s review)  
FBC: Hb 119 (sl low, was normal earlier this yr per file), WCC/Plt N  
UEC/LFT/TFT N  
CRP 12 (mild ↑)  
Albumin 30 (↓, prev 33)  
Glucose/HbA1c N  
Overall → chronic illness / malnutrition picture, no new red flags for malignancy/infection. Explained wt loss likely MND cachexia + dysphagia, not another reversible cause. Pt not happy, asking for “more tests / PET scan”. Discussed low yield, high burden → not ordered today.  

A  
1) Cachexia / wt loss sec to advanced MND + dysphagia – progressive, no evidence alt cause on recent bloods/exam  
2) Bulbar MND w oropharyngeal dysphagia → aspiration risk  
3) Low mood / adjustment depression likely, no current AD  
4) High expectations of curative tx, some conflict around limits of medicine  

P  
Cachexia / appetite  
– Brief dietary advice only (time). Small frequent, high cal/high protein, oral supplements (Ensure/Resource etc) suggested  
– Emphasised symptom focus not cure/target wt (discussed but pt still fixated on wt gain)  

Meds  
– Pt specifically requesting steroids. Discussed short trial dex as appetite/energy stimulant, risks (sleep, mood, glucose, myopathy).  
– Commenced dexamethasone 2mg mane with food x5 days only  
  • Rx: Dex 2mg mane #7 no rpt (PBS) – note: review before any extension  
  • Plan: review 5–7/7 (telehealth ok) → if no benefit stop. If some benefit, consider short extension at lowest effective dose up to ~2/52 then taper/cease. Long-term steroids NOT recommended (documented + explained).  

Mood  
– Discussed mirtazapine for mood/sleep/appetite. Pt reluctant re “happy pills”, agreed to consider but wants to see what steroids do first.  
– Plan: at next review (1–2/52, longer appt) consider start mirtazapine 15mg nocte if mood low + appetite still poor. Formal mood scale then.  

Dysphagia / PEG  
– Re-referral SP via MND clinic for urgent swallow reassessment, texture/fluid advice, aspiration risk, and PEG suitability discussion.  
– Advised thickened fluids if ongoing cough w thin liquids (to be guided by SP).  
– PEG: discussed briefly – may help meds/nutrition but not cure cachexia or necessarily prolong life. Decision w Neuro/SP/Gastro. Pt keen, will pursue via MND clinic; I’ll support once team agrees.  

Further Ix  
– No PET/CT etc ordered – discussed low likelihood to change mgmt given clear MND dx + current bloods. Pt challenged but accepted for now when framed in terms of effort vs benefit.  

Carer input  
– Partner confirms very small intake, worried about wt + mood. Advised not to push food; focus on comfort (kept brief).  

Safety net  
– Advise ED/urgent review if ↑SOB, chest infection, sig choking episodes, unable to maintain fluids, marked functional decline. RTC if worse / new sx.  

F/up  
– Telehealth review 5–7/7 for dex response/SE, appetite, mood  
– Long F2F 30min in 2–3/52: wt, appetite, swallow, consider mirtazapine, discuss 2nd opinion Neuro + PEG + broader goals of care / ACP if pt willing.  

Today  
– Med change: started short trial dexamethasone as above  
– Referral: SP (MND clinic) urgent review for dysphagia/PEG discussion
