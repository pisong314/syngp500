# Labyrinthitis / dizziness  
Sudden onset vertigo ~12/7 ago room spinning worse on head movement assoc N+V

Assessment  
1 Resolving presumed viral labyrinthitis 2° peripheral vestibular dysfunction  
Marked improvement since ED still mild residual imbalance brief positional dizziness  
No focal neuro deficits nil central red flags exam c/w recovery phase peripheral cause  

2 General health check otherwise well 34yo F  
Low–mod lifestyle risk factors wants preventive care  

3 Contraception / sexual health  
Inconsistent condom use ?CST up to date  

Plan  

1 Labyrinthitis / vestibular sx  
- Education re natural hx usually settles over 1–6/52 some residual imbalance for few more wks  
- Advised avoid routine vestibular suppressants now to allow central compensation  
- Prochlorperazine only prn severe vertigo/N+V warned re drowsiness avoid driving or machinery after dose  
- Encouraged gradual ↑ in usual activities walking avoid prolonged bed rest  
- Simple vestibular rehab shown eg gaze stabilisation fixed target with head side–side gradual ↑ head movement sitting/standing gave written sheet  
- Work ok for usual bar duties avoid heights or situations where sudden imbalance dangerous  

Flying  
- Safe to fly once feels steady walking suggested defer non urgent flights 1–2/52 until sx minimal  

Red flags / safety net  
- Urgent r/v or ED if  
  • sudden marked worsening vertigo + severe HA  
  • new weakness numbness speech or visual change  
  • persistent vomiting or unable to walk  
Also advised to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain or confusion  

2 General health / prevention  
- Pathology as above R/V results 1–2/52  
- Brief lifestyle discussion diet more regular meals ↑fruit/veg protein snacks for shifts  
- Etoh currently mostly within NHMRC limits advised avoid binges  
- Encouraged aim ≥150min/wk mod exercise she keen to try home workouts  
- Imms asked to bring any records next visit likely due dTpa booster if >10yrs and discuss COVID booster  
- Cervical screening not done today time limited main focus dizziness she unsure last CST asked to book longer appt for CST + contraception chat

- No sx STI today offered future STI screen when attends for CST  

Billing  
Standard consult item 23  
Bulk billed  

Follow up  
- R/V 1–2/52 for labyrinthitis sx check + pathology results book long appt for CST/contraception same or later  
- Earlier r/v if vertigo worsens new neuro sx or other concerns
