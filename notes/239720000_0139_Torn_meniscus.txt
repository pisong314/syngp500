58yo M, self‑employed chippy, in mainly for forms (Housing / Centrelink) re knee. Says “knee’s getting worse this last year, can’t do what I used to on the tools”.  

Hx all over the place today – main issues:  
- Chronic R knee pain, known OA + degenerative medial meniscal tear, old ACL + MCL injury (MRI ~18/12 ago per ortho – pt has report on phone, matches our letter in results tab).  
- Pain medial > lateral, worse with kneeling, squatting, stairs, prolonged standing onsite, carrying timber, ladders etc.  
- Can walk ~200–300m flat then needs to stop. Struggles to kneel more than a few mins. Turning down heavier jobs, shorter days (4–5h not 8–10).  
- Mild swelling some evenings. No recent trauma. Gradual worsening over years of manual work.  
- Using OTC panadol + Nurofen “most days”, no regular Rx analgesia.  

Marked health anxiety today:  
- Repeatedly asking “are you sure it’s not bone cancer / I’ll end up in a wheelchair?”  
- Wants “another MRI just to be safe” + “more tests”.  
- No red flag features volunteered: no night pain waking him every night, no fevers, no wt loss, no systemic sx.  

PMHx (relevant):  
- R knee OA  
- Degenerative medial meniscal tear R  
- Old ACL tear + previous MCL sprain R, non‑op  
No hx IHD, DM, inflammatory arthritis noted in file.  

Meds (re knee):  
- Paracetamol up to 1 g TDS PRN (self‑directed).  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg up to TDS PRN. No PPI, no anticoag. NKDA.  

O/E (focused):  
Anxious, talkative, NAD.  
BP 132/78, HR 78 reg, afebrile, BMI ~29.  
R knee: mild varus, small effusion, tender medial joint line, no erythema/warmth. ROM ext 0°, flex ~110° (pain end range). Crepitus. No true locking on exam. Ligaments functionally stable to gentle testing, no calf tenderness, distal pulses/sensation intact.  
L knee: mild crepitus only.  
Gait: mild antalgic, favouring R.  

Ix:  
- No new imaging – discussed not indicated: degenerative picture already established, no new trauma/locking/sepsis signs.  
- Offered bloods for reassurance + general screen: FBE, U&E, LFT, ESR/CRP – form done, to do at onsite collection. (No prior inflammatory markers on file to compare).  

Assessment:  
1) Chronic R knee pain – OA + degenerative medial meniscal tear with old ACL/MCL injury. Functionally limiting for heavy manual work but stable, no acute complication.  
2) Work capacity significantly reduced → needs documentation for Centrelink/housing.  
3) Health anxiety / catastrophic thinking around knee and future mobility.  

Plan (bit fragmented due to time + forms):  
- Completed Housing / Centrelink paperwork today: documented dx (R knee OA, degenerative medial meniscal tear, old ACL/MCL) and functional limits (reduced walking tolerance, can’t kneel/squat/climb ladders safely, difficulty carrying heavy loads, can’t sustain full‑time physical work, needs regular analgesia).  
- Reinforced conservative mx:  
  • Panadol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day).  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food, short bursts only – warned re GI/renal risk, avoid continuous daily use without review.  
  • Suggested topical NSAID gel (Voltaren etc) to R knee up to QID – OTC.  
- Physio: referral done for strengthening (quads/hip/glutes) + activity modification. Suggested look for bulk‑billing if cost an issue.  
- Weight and low‑impact exercise briefly discussed (bike, swim, flat walking as tolerated) – flagged but didn’t go into detail, time limited.  

Surgery / imaging discussion:  
- Explained arthroscopy / “clean‑out” not routinely helpful in established OA in his age group; aim is conservative mx, preserve joint as long as possible.  
- Agreed no repeat MRI now – unlikely to change management given existing findings and current sx.  

Health anxiety:  
- Reassured re low suspicion for malignancy/infection given hx + exam.  
- Suggested limit Dr Google, use Healthdirect etc if needed.  
- Mentioned option of MHCP / CBT for health anxiety – asked him to book a longer mental health appt if he wants to pursue.  

Safety‑net:  
- RTC / ED if sudden severe swelling, hot/red knee, can’t weight‑bear, true locking (cannot fully extend), fevers, or unexplained wt loss.  

Follow‑up:  
- Review 4–6/52 or earlier PRN to:  
  • Check physio/analgesia response  
  • Review bloods  
  • Revisit MHCP if still very anxious.  

Pt verbalised understanding but continued to seek reassurance; reiterated chronic degenerative condition, manageable but will limit heavy carpentry long‑term.
