Telehealth video r/v – regional pt (GC area)  
Private – bulk billed  

Reason for consult  
Acute L knee pain  

HPI  
72yo F Anglo Aus retired farm admin lives with husband independent ADLs  
Known L knee OA prev XR 2019 (Dubbo GP per pt) ?degenerative meniscal tear discussed last yr no MRI  

Yesterday arvo twisted L knee while turning L carrying washing basket knee semiflexed WB  
Immediate sharp medial knee pain  
Since  
- Pain constant ache ~6/10 sharp with twisting or trying full extension medial jt line  
- Mobilising slowly hobbling WB ok short distances avoids stairs  
- Intermittent catching when straightening from flexion feels “stuck” but can force straightens so nil true locking  
- Mild ↑ swelling vs R yesterday abit beter today  
- Nil giving way nil pop nil major trauma  

Pt very keen for MRI + ortho  
“not mucking around with this knee again want an MRI and a surgeon” asking re arthroscopy “clean it up”  

Red flag screen  
Nil fever night sweats wt loss  
Nil marked redness severe warmth  
Nil calf pain or swell  
Nil high impact injury  

Impact  
Sleep disturbed rolling in bed  
Still managing toilet self care  
Concern re ability to care for husband COPD if mobility ↓  

PMHx  
OA knees L>R  
HTN controlled  
Hyperlipidaemia  
Nil known IHD DM  

Meds  
Irbesartan 150mg mane  
Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
Paracetamol 665mg SR 2 tabs bd PRN for arthritis currently regular last 24h  
Occ ibuprofen 200–400mg PRN none this episode concerned re kidneys  
Nil anticoag  

Allergies  
NKDA  

SHx  
Lives on small property outside town drives  
Finances ok prefers avoid frequent city trips  
Local physio available public hosp ~45min  

Telehealth exam (limited)  
Gen alert well looking mildly distressed by pain bit impatient  
Vitals per home machine BP 132/78 HR ~70 afebrile 36.7  
Gait on video antalgic favouring L WB preserved nil collapse  
L knee on screen mild swelling vs R nil obvious erythema  
Active flex/ext present pain near terminal ext near full ext achieved with effort guarded nil clear mech block  
Pt indicates tenderness medial jt line  
Calves on video sym no obvious swell  

Dx / Impression  
1 Acute flare L knee OA with probable degenerative medial meniscal tear 2° low energy twist in semiflexed WB knee in known OA  
   Features c/w degenerative meniscal pathology rather than acute traumatic tear in normal knee  
   Nil features fx septic arthritis major lig injury  
2 Chronic L knee OA symptomatic  
3 High expectations for imaging/surgery requires expectation management  

Investigations  
Nil imaging ordered today discussed rationale  
Consider XR/MRI later if fails conservative mx or develops true locking etc  
No bloods today  

Plan  
Discussed at length current evidence for degenerative meniscal tears in OA age group arthroscopy generally not helpful may ↑ OA progression MRI often incidental findings not changing mx long waits etc  
Pt initially resistant “why cant you just order the MRI and let the surgeon decide” eventually agreed trial conservative mx with clear f/u timeframe documented

1 Acute mx – conservative  
- POLICE advised  
  Protection / relative rest 48–72h avoid twisting squatting uneven loads short walks only  
  Gentle walking on flat as pain allows avoid prolonged bed rest  
  Ice 15–20min up to 4x/day next few days  
  Compression simple elastic sleeve / crepe if has one not too tight  
  Elevation when resting  
- Analgesia  
  Continue paracetamol up to 1g q6h max 4g/day (explained adjust from SR)  
  Short trial NSAID if tolerated ibuprofen 400mg with food up to tds PRN max 5/7 then r/v risks GI renal BP discussed avoid other OTC NSAIDs  
  Topical NSAID suggested OTC diclofenac 1% gel to L knee tds–qds fewer systemic effects  
  Nil opioids at this stage  

2 Rehab  
- Physio ref to local provider sent via HealthLink for ROM once pain settling quad + hip strengthening gait retraining OA education  
- No rigid brace needed may use neoprene sleeve for comfort only  

3 Imaging / ortho  
- Explained MRI not routine in >45yrs with established OA unless  
  • true mechanical locking unable fully extend despite effort  
  • concern major lig injury or alternate dx  
- Agreed plan  
  • Nil MRI or ortho ref today  
  • If after ~3/12 of structured conservative mx (analgesia physio activity mod) still significant mechanical Sx eg locking catching with loss of ext or major functional limitation will reconsider MRI + ortho ref  
Pt emphasised doesn’t want to be “fobbed off for years” concerns acknowledged  

4 OA longer term  
- Briefly reinforced wt control low impact exercise eg flat walking bike once flare settles  
- Formal OA and med review deferred to longer appt in 1–2 mths  

Safety net  
Advised urgent in person GP or ED if  
- sudden inability to WB or fully extend knee true locking  
- marked ↑ swelling redness warmth or fever  
- severe uncontrolled pain despite simple analgesia  
- new calf swelling redness SOB or chest pain  
Otherwise if nil improvement over 7–10/7 or function deteriorates earlier r/v  

F/U  
Telehealth r/v 1/52 booked to reassess pain function need for in person exam  
Plan longer OA review appt in 1–2/12  

Pt engagement  
Pt somewhat demanding repeatedly requesting MRI / ortho comparing to prev GP  
Required clear firm explanation of guidelines eventually agreed trial conservative mx still keen on imaging if not beter  

[No tests ordered today – nil pathology to chase]
