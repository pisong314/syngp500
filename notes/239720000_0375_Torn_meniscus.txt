Bulk billed consult walk in clinic Syd metro  

Dr [Registrar Name] (GP Reg yr1)  

Reason for visit  
- Vax update "all my jabs up to date and a COVID top up"  
- Ongoing R knee pain known meniscal tear + MCL sprain  

S  
32yo male warehouse worker first time to this practice  

# Vaccination Hx  
Walk in asking for vax  
Says work pushing him to be "fully covered" feels he "always picks up bugs" at work  
Requests COVID booster + flu shot asks if there is a "stronger one"  

No vax record with him  
Says usual GP "just does whatever the latest COVID one is and something for tetanus every few years"  
Last GP visit maybe ~1yr ago unsure which vax  
Nil prev vax reactions  
Nil prev anaphylaxis nil egg allergy nil latex allergy  
Nil current febrile illness URTI sx or recent COVID  

Lives with partner uses PT to work high exposure to co workers public  

Believes warehouse chemicals dust "wreck my immune system" reassured vax still main prevention for serious infection  

# R knee Hx  
Known R medial meniscal tear + MCL sprain from twisting injury at work ~3/12 ago box lifting workers comp case  
Initial imaging + ortho review already done per pt  

Now intermittent medial joint line pain worse end of day stairs  
Occasional catching sensation "grabs then lets go" nil true locking nil giving way  
Nil recent new trauma nil redness warmth nil systemic sx  

Has done some physio but inconsistent due to shifts  
Uses OTC ibuprofen 200–400mg up to TDS PRN helps  
No other regular meds  

Pt convinced knee "probably needs surgery" wants repeat MRI and "referral straight back to a knee surgeon today"  
States prev GP "just orders the scan when I say it's worse"  
Quite pushy re MRI wants quick fix feels cold air at freezers and steel capped boots make it worse  

PMHx  
- Traumatic R medial meniscal tear (by hx)  
- R MCL sprain  
Nil known chronic med condx  
Nil prev surgery  

Meds  
- Ibuprofen 200–400mg TDS PRN self directed  

Allergies  
- NKDA  

FHx  
Nil known FHx inflammatory arthritis or autoimmune condx relevant to knee  

SHx  
Full time warehouse storeperson heavy manual handling  
Smokes socially weekends ~3–5 cig  
Alcohol binge pattern weekends 6–8 std drinks at a time  
Lives with partner cost a concern prefers bulk billing uses train bus needs local services  

Behaviour  
Demanding somewhat impatient tries to add mult issues incl "blood tests to check my immune system" despite time limits  

O  
Vitals  
BP 124/78 HR 78 reg RR 14 Temp 36.8 SpO2 99% RA  
BMI est ~27  

Gen  
Well appearing ambulant mild guarding R knee mobilising indep nil acute distress  

R knee (focused)  
Inspection mild fullness medial joint line nil deformity nil erythema  
Palpation tender medial joint line + along MCL nil ↑ warmth  
ROM full extension slight ↓ terminal flexion due to pain nil mechanical block  
Stability varus valgus stress → medial discomfort nil gross laxity  
Ant drawer grossly normal  
McMurray → medial discomfort nil definite painful click  
Gait slight antalgic favours R side but able to fully WB  

No features to suggest acute septic arthritis or #  

Immunisation check  
My Health Record sparse prev practice not linked  
Likely completed childhood schedule adult boosters uncertain  

A  
1. Vax update adult 32yo male occupational exposure  
   - Wants to be "fully covered"  
   - Nil contraindications today appears well afebrile  
   - Priority today COVID booster + seasonal flu per ATAGI recs given warehouse work high exposure  
   - dTpa status unclear likely >5–10yrs since last but not confirmed  

2. R knee pain 2° known traumatic medial meniscal tear + MCL sprain subacute stable  
   - ~3/12 post injury  
   - Intermittent mechanical sx but nil true locking nil gross instability nil red flags  
   - Exam consistent with ongoing meniscal pathology +/- residual MCL tenderness but functionally able to fully extend WB  
   - Current guidelines suggest conservative mx first esp <45yrs as many improve with physio strengthening  
   - Repeat MRI today unlikely to change immediate mx in absence of locking or major instability  
   - Pt v keen on MRI + ortho refn expecting surgery some mismatch between expectations and evidence  
   - No signs of septic joint inflammatory arthropathy or acute re injury  

3. Time limited consult mult issues  
   - Additional request for "blood tests to check immune system" deferred to longer appt  

P  
1. Vax today  
   - COVID-19 booster given IM L deltoid (current season mRNA per practice stock) informed consent obtained discussed usual SE  
   - Seasonal influenza vax standard quadrivalent IM R deltoid  
   - Asked to wait 15 mins post vax in waiting room nil immediate reaction reported at time of note  
   - Advised re delayed allergic reaction sx ED/000 if SOB facial swelling etc  
   - Advised to obtain prev vax records from prior GP / AIR / Medicare for more accurate catch up  
   - Plan dTpa booster at next visit once records checked or if remains uncertain and >10yrs since last  

   Admin  
   - Both vax documented in AIR  

2. R knee  
   - Explained natural hx of traumatic meniscal tear in younger adults many improve over several mths with good rehab  
   - Discussed risks of early meniscectomy incl ↑ OA risk later aim to preserve meniscus  
   - Explained reasons not ordering repeat MRI or urgent ortho ref today given nil locking nil major instability and only 3/12 since injury conservative mx not yet optimised  
   - Pt expressed frustration "So you're just going to let it get worse" spent time explaining rationale emphasised not ignoring symptoms rather stepwise approach  
   - Analgesia  
     - Suggested paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN  
     - May continue ibuprofen up to 400mg TDS with food short term advised to stop if GI upset nil current contraindications known  
   - Physio  
     - Encouraged to re engage with physio focus on strengthening ROM adherence despite shift work brainstormed earlier or late appts  
     - Offered to do more structured physio plan next visit (care plan if criteria met once more hx on file)  
   - Activity  
     - Discussed POLICE principles for flares protection optimal loading ice compression elevation  
     - Briefly discussed potential for modified duties letter if ongoing difficulty with heavy lifting but not completed today due to time need more detail on role  
   - Imaging / ref  
     - No imaging ordered today explained clearly that MRI reserved for failure of conservative mx 3–6/12 or if new red flags  
     - Ortho ref deferred will consider if  
       - true locking (unable to fully extend)  
       - significant instability giving way  
       - or persistent significant functional limitation despite structured physio over next 3–6/12  
   - Safety net  
     - Red flags explained sudden inability to WB or extend knee large effusion + fever red hot joint or new trauma with severe pain → ED or urgent GP r/v  

3. Other requests  
   - Explained time limited today focus on vax + knee  
   - Offered longer appt in next few wks for "getting sick all the time" gen health check possible bloods FBE UEC LFT lipids Vit D etc plus smoking alcohol counselling  
   - Pt abit annoyed about delay but accepted when explained can re attend walk in "dont want to wait weeks" advised can come any day ask for longer slot  

F/U  
- R/V 2–4/52  
  - Check knee sx adherence to physio analgesia reconsider imaging / ortho ref if not improving  
  - Review vax records bring AIR printout / Medicare record consider dTpa booster  
  - Book separate longer consult if still concerned re frequent minor illness lifestyle factors etc  

Plan discussed with pt who appeared to understand though still focused on idea of needing MRI

Supervisor addendum  

[Added 22/11/25 17:10 by Dr Chen GP supervisor]  

Reviewed case with registrar post consult  
Agree likely stable subacute meniscal injury + MCL sprain nil red flags today exam reassuring full extension WB preserved  
Conservative mx appropriate at this stage  
Support decision to defer repeat MRI and ortho ref until at least 3–6/12 of optimised physio unless locking or instability develops  

Vax choices appropriate per current ATAGI for healthy 32yo with occupational exposure  
Agree with plan to clarify dTpa status next visit and give booster if uncertain >10yrs  

Learning points discussed with registrar  
- Managing expectations in MSK injuries esp around imaging and surgery  
- Using red flag framework to justify not ordering MRI  
- Brief motivational approach re physio adherence  

Happy with safety netting and f/u plan
