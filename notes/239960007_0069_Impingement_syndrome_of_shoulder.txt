CC: R shoulder pain  

HPI  
~5–6 days R shoudler pain, woke with mild ache, now worsneed. Marked flare last 24–48 hrs, “sharp and grabbing” with movment. No trauma, no fall, no heavy lift. Lots of overhed whiteboard / class display work.  
Pain anterolat R shoudler radiats to mid humerus, not past elbow. 7–8/10 on movt, 3/10 rest. Worse at night, can’t lie on R side, strugglign to slepe. Aggrav: reach overhead, puttign jumper on, reach behind back (bra), across body, hanging washing. Better with arm by side, heat pack “helps a bit”.  
Using occas ibuprofren 200mg nocte only, reluctant to take tablets. No neck pain, no paraesthesiae, no CP, SOB, fevers, sweats, wt loss, no redness/swelling.  

Partner reports pt “pacing around all night with it” and encourgaed review – pt initially wanted to ignore.  

PMHx  
No chronic illness, no prev shoudler/neck probs, no DM, no malignnacy, no inflmm arth.  

Meds  
OTC ibuprofen PRN only.  

Allergies  
NKDA.  

Examination  
Obs WNL: BP 128/78, HR 74, afebr.  
R shoudler: no deform, no swelling/erythema. Mild tendnerness anterolat acromion/GT.  
ROM: active flex ~120° pain limited, abd ~90–100° w painful arc ~60–120°. Int rot limited behind back (can’t reach bra strap). Passive ROM near full, pain but no hard stop.  
Supraspinatus testing reproduces pain, ?slight weaknes vs pain inhib. Infraspinatus / subscap strenght grossly ok.  
Hawkins +, Neer +, painful arc +.  
C-spine full ROM, no reporduction of pain, neurovasc intact UL.  

Impression  
R subacromial pain syndrome / impingment, likely rotator cuff overload from repetitve overhead work. No red flag features on hx/exam; low susp septic joint, # or large cuff tear at present.  

Plan  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h).  
  • Topical NSAID eg Voltaren gel to R shoulder tds–qds.  
  • Hold off oral NSAID for now as pt prefers; can trial naproxen 500mg bd with food x5–7/7 if pain not controlled – discuss at review.  
– Activity: avoid heavy / repetitve overhead use R arm where poss (whiteboard, displays). Keep arm moving within pain limits, no sling.  
– Ex’s: showed basic pendulum and gentle assisted flexion; gave clinic shoudler impingment handout + QR link.  

Ix  
No imaging today – likely clinical dx. Consider R shoudler XR (AP + outlet) if persisting >6–8/52 or atypical course / night pain very severe. No bloods currenlty.  

Follow up / safety net  
– Review 2–3/52 to reassess pain and function; if poor progress → refer physio (discussed, pt concerned about time/cost, happy to try home programe first).  
– If still sig symtoms at ~6/52 despite ex’s → consider subacromial steroid inj and/or US/MRI / sports ortho opinon.  
– Advised ED/urgent review if sudden marked weaknes (can’t lift arm), new swelling/redness/fever, neuro sx, or rapid worsening.
