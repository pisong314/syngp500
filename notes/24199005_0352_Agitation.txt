# Assessment  
1 Agitation behavioural dysregulation in context ASD + CP  
   – No e/o delirium or psychosis today  
   – Exacerbated by sensory overload work environment high caffeine poor sleep psychosocial stressors housing + work pressure  
2 Hx delirium 2° pneumonia now resolved but ↑vulnerable with acute illness meds  
3 Functional impairment – current sx impacting ability to sustain share housing and supported employment requires environmental + psychosocial accommodations as per disability support guidelines  
4 CP stable mild LL spasticity on baclofen  

# Plan  
Time limited today focus safety + forms brief mgmt discussion  

Agitation / ASD related  
– Non pharm first line as per anxiety/autism mgmt guidelines  
  • Discussed environmental strategies routine  
  • Suggested noise cancelling headphones / earplugs if safe @work  
  • Recommend scheduled “time out” to quiet area when early agitation signs pacing ↑HR etc  
  • Brief psychoeducation re triggers noise change caffeine and early strategies paced breathing brief walk contact support worker  
  • Encouraged re‑engage psych via NDIS ideally after hours / telehealth due to work constraints  

Caffeine  
– Strongly advised ↓energy drink intake aim max 1 can/day then gradual taper replace with water explained likely role in ↑arousal tachy sleep disturbance pt reluctant but will “try cut down abit”  

Pharmacological  
– Discussed options SSRI eg sertaline for underlying anxiety irritability ± low dose antipsychotic later under specialist guidance if severe behavioural disturbance  
– Given time pressure need for full risk/benefit discussion baseline Ix decision today = defer starting psych meds  
– Plan for longer appt for comprehensive MH r/v prior to any script  

Delirium risk  
– Advised if acutely confused disoriented or marked change in behaviour esp with infection to seek urgent ED/GP  

CP  
– Stable nil new weakness spasms or pain  
– Continue baclofen 10mg BD  
– Consider rehab/physio r/v future when more time  

Forms / admin  
– Completed key sections Centrelink / housing med report today  
  • Documented permanent neurodevelopmental dx ASD CP  
  • Chronic agitation sensory overload difficulty in noisy unpredictable envts  
  • Need for low stimulus stable accommodation predictable routine quiet space at work for de‑escalation plus flexible supports  
– Explained may need extended appt + collateral reports if further detailed paperwork requested pt initially frustrated “can’t you just tick everything now” but accepted medico‑legal requirements  

Ix  
– Nil ordered today afebrile obs normal nil features suggesting acute med cause  
– At next longer r/v if considering SSRI/antipsychotic will arrange baseline bloods FBC U&E LFT TSH B12/folate fasting lipids BSL  

Safety net  
– Advised attend ED or urgent GP if rapid escalation agitation with thoughts of harming self/others or new confusion halucinations or marked behaviour change  

F/U  
– Book extended appt 20–30 mins in 2–3/52 for  
  • Comprehensive MH review  
  • Consideration of SSRI / other agents  
  • Coordination with psych + NDIS team  
  • Any further forms  
– Pt says mornings “impossible” due to shifts offered late arvo appt he will check with supervisor and book via reception  

Time  
~15 min standard consult multiple issues only agitation safety + essential form sections addressed today further issues next r/v
