58F reg pt – chronic LBP f/u  

CC: “Back’s been a bit worse at night lately – harder to get to sleep”  

HPC  
Known lumbar facet OA (prev XR). Last review ~few mths ago  
Daytime pain ~same, mild ache, ↑ if sits too long at desk. Past 3–4/52 more aware of pain at night when trying to get to sleep.  
Pain localised low lumbar, R>L, non-radicular. Dull ache + occasional sharp twinge w ext/twisting in bed.  
No leg weakness/numbness, no bowel/bladder sx, no saddle anaesthesia. No wt loss, fever, night sweats.  
Sleep: takes longer to get off to sleep, wakes 1–2x to change position, then back to sleep. Mood OK, just “frustrated”.  
?contrib: new firmer mattress ~2/12, late evening coffee x2.  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1 g up to TDS PRN – usually 1–2x/day most days  
Voltaren 1% gel PRN “when I remember”  
No reg oral NSAID, no opioids  

O/E  
Obs stable – BP 128/76, HR 74, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA, BMI ~27 (prev)  
Back: local TTP over lower lumbar facet joints R>L, no midline tenderness. Mildly ↓ flex end-range ache. Ext/rotation reproduces local pain only, no radicular sx. LL power 5/5, reflexes N, sensation intact, SLR -ve bilat. Gait N.  

Ix  
Nil today. Prev lumbar XR: facet OA, no red flags. Current picture same pattern.  

A  
1) Lumbar facet joint syndrome – known, mild flare, worse perception at night, mech pattern, non-radicular, no red flags  
2) Sleep onset delay 2° pain (and likely late caffeine / mattress)  

P  
– Reassure benign mech LBP, no red flags today  
– Activity: encourage micro-breaks at work (stand/stretch q30–45min), cont walking  
– Ergonomics: remind re lumbar support, screen height etc (already has ergo chair)  
– Sleep hygiene:  
   • Avoid caffeine after ~1500 (esp evening coffees)  
   • Trial mattress topper/extra padding rather than reverting to very soft mattress  
– Exercises: cont home lumbar stretches/strength (pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest, gentle rot). Offered physio; pt prefers to start next month when work quieter → plan physio referral then if still symptomatic  
– Heat pack to LB esp evenings  

Meds  
– Paracetamol 1 g up to QID PRN (max 4 g/day) – advised more regular use x5–7 days during flare rather than sporadic  
– Diclofenac 1% gel: advise reg use to affected area up to QID x1–2/52 then PRN  
– Oral NSAID: discussed short course naproxen/ibuprofen if not controlled – hold for now as coping. Review earlier if ↑pain for script + counsel re GI/renal/CV risk  
– Opioids not indicated, pt agrees  

Safety net  
Warned re red flags – leg weakness/numbness, saddle anaesthesia, bowel/bladder change, fever, wt loss, constant unrelenting night pain → urgent review/ED. Otherwise RTC if worse or not settling.  

F/U  
Book longer chronic pain / med review with usual GP in ~4/52 (pt also wants “all my usual meds and repeats” done then). Earlier appt if ↑night pain or new sx.  
If still sig sleep issues next visit → consider formal physio referral, pain mgmt options, screen mood/anxiety.
