22/11/2025 – Telehealth video r/v (Medicare compliant – pt in own home, GP in rooms)

Reason for consult  
Pt requested video r/v re “general health check – just a few things while I’m here”  
Multiple issues raised >8 agreed to focus on back pain + general health check others deferred

Hx  
58 yr old Anglo‑Australian female PT admin work 3/7 in rural practice lives metro  
Known lumbar facet joint OA dx clinically by prev GP

1) Lumbar back pain – facet joint syndrome  
Longstanding intermittent low back pain localised lumbar region nil radiation  
Current flare ~3/52 gradual onset nil trauma  
Pain 4/10 baseline up to 7/10 after prolonged sitting or driving  
Exacerbated by extension twisting eg “hanging the washing” “reaching into back seat”  
Improved with heat pack gentle stretches distraction  
Often more aware of pain at night when quiet  
Red flags – nil leg weakness nil numbness or paraesthesia nil saddle anaesthesia nil bowel or bladder sx nil fever wt loss night sweats  
Function – still managing ADLs needs more breaks @work employer flexible  
Meds – paracetamol 1 g up to tds prn 2–3 days/week partial relief  
Prev ibuprofen PO → dyspepsia avoids reg NSAIDs nil opioids  
Non pharm – walking dog short walks heat pack no current physio last >12/12  
Pt queries effect of new mattress and office chair also has stopped tomatoes “nightshades” explained OA multifactorial ergonomics relevant diet change minimal evidence but harmless if she wishes  
Mood – frustrated with chronic pain coping ok nil depn nil anxiety nil sleep issues other than pain waking

2) Preventive / general health  
No known chronic medical dx documented  
Meds – intermittent paracetamol OTC vit D “every now and then”  
Allergies – NKDA  
Lifestyle – ex smoker quit >20 yrs ~5 pack‑yrs alcohol 1–2 glasses wine on weekends  
Diet “too much toast not enough veg” exercise walks dog ~20 mins most days avoids heavier exercise ?re back  
Wt – no scales thinks central wt gain last 2 yrs  
FHx – parents with OA only nil known premature CVD nil diabetes  
Screening – unsure last BP lipids glucose thinks cervical screen >5 yrs mammogram “a few years back” unsure if ever did bowel cancer screening kit  
Vacc – COVID primary + 1 booster unsure when unsure last flu vax

Other issues raised today but deferred due to time  
Right shoulder pain when hanging washing  
Intermittent tingling toes when sits “funny”  
Altered taste after some foods  
Mole on back ?darker per husband  
Dry eyes on computer  
Explained need for separate longer appt for each or grouped issues pt somewhat reluctant but accepted

Telehealth limitations discussed unable to perform hands on exam advised need for F2F if change or red flags

Exam (via video – limited)  
Gen – well appearing woman NAD speaking full sentences  
Colour – nil obvious pallor or cyanosis  
Resp – RR visually normal nil audible wheeze or cough  
Neuro – alert oriented normal affect coherent speech moves all limbs spontaneously nil obvious focal deficit  
MSK – observed rising from chair independently but slowly mild stiffness on straightening able to walk a few steps in room gait non antalgic nil obvious deformity  
Vitals – not available no home BP machine appears comfortable

Assessment  
1) Lumbar facet joint syndrome OA – chronic condition with current mild–mod flare typical mechanical pattern  
No clinical red flags nil features of radiculopathy or cauda equina  
Given stable longstanding sx and typical pattern imaging not indicated at present

Differential considered  
– Lumbar discogenic pain or radiculopathy less likely – nil radiation neuro sx  
– Vertebral fracture unlikely – nil trauma nil focal tenderness on obs able to mobilise  
– Malignancy or infection unlikely – nil systemic sx nil wt loss nil fever

2) Preventive health assessment – incomplete via telehealth  
Needs F2F for BP wt BMI waist circ formal CVD risk calc and screening update  
No prior documented results available in our system so will treat as baseline check

Plan  

1) Lumbar facet joint OA / back pain  
Education  
– Reassured re absence of red flag features today explained chronic degenerative nature of facet OA importance of staying active rather than bed rest  
Non pharm  
– Encourage regular low impact exercise walking continue dog walks within comfort  
– Core strengthening and lumbar stabilisation via physio  
– Pacing strategies avoid prolonged static posture @desk recommended micro breaks q30–45 mins review of chair height lumbar support screen height  
– Continue heat packs as helpful  
Referral  
– Physio ref for local provider near rural workplace for individualised program + ergonomic advice  
  → To email referral to pt today  
Pharmacological  
– Continue paracetamol up to 1 g qid prn max 4 g/24h reminded to check OTC combo products  
– Suggested trial topical NSAID eg Voltaren Emulgel to lumbar region up to tds as per pack as first line before oral NSAIDs given prev dyspepsia age >55  
– If inadequate analgesia consider short course oral NSAID with GI risk assessment PPI cover as needed at F2F r/v  
– Opioids not recommended for chronic mechanical spinal pain discussed pt agrees to avoid

Safety net  
– Urgent F2F or ED if new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia bowel or bladder dysfunction severe unremitting night pain fever unexplained wt loss or rapid deterioration in function  
– If pain not improving over next 4–6/52 or function ↓ despite above → arrange F2F for exam consider imaging ± pain clinic

2) Preventive / general health  
Explained limitations of telehealth for full check  
Plan F2F appt 4–6/52 for  
– BP HR wt BMI waist circ  
– Pathology: fasting lipids fasting glucose ± HbA1c pathology form to be given then  
– CVD risk assessment once results and measurements available  
– Screening  
  • Cervical screening test likely overdue >5 yrs – offer CST  
  • Mammogram – age 58 likely due check BreastScreen QLD/NSW (to confirm region) status and arrange  
  • Bowel cancer screening – check if ever received FIT kit if not arrange new kit via NBCSP  
– Immunisations – confirm last COVID booster and flu vax offer as indicated  
Lifestyle  
– Brief discussion re ↑ veg whole grains ↓ processed foods maintain regular walking reassured that graded exercise safe for back

3) Other issues deferred  
– Documented “shopping list” issues shoulder pain mole on back toe paraesthesia dysgeusia dry eyes  
– Advised to book long F2F appt specifically for shoulder + skin check another if toe tingling taste or eye sx persist  
– Will address sequentially to allow adequate Hx and exam

Follow up  
– Book F2F within 4–6/52 for preventive health check + back pain r/v and to provide pathology forms  
– Earlier F2F if pain worsens or function ↓  
– ED or urgent care if red flag spinal sx as above
