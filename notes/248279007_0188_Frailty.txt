84F f/up gen pain / frailty  

Hx:  
3–4/12 ↑aching/heavy thighs/hips/low back esp end of day / >10–15min walk. Dull 4–6/10 non-rad. AM stiffness ~10min only. Feels weaker rising from chair, “less stable” uneven ground. 1x near fall off kerb no injury.  
Fatigued by late arvo. Appetite ↓ a bit. No fevers / NS / wt loss she aware of. No focal jt swell/red/heat.  
On atorva 20 nocte – queries statin myopathy. Also queries new firm mattress.  
On warfarin – reports INR “up and down” lately. No bleed/bruising/melaena/haematuria.  

PMHx (abridged): AF (NV, on warfarin), HTN, T2DM (met XR 500, diet – prev well ctrl), HLD, OA knees/lumbar, osteoporosis (alendronate + Ca/Vit D), hypothyroid. Known mild frailty (CFS 5 last yr).  

Meds (key): warfarin var dose (INR clinic, target 2–3), metoprolol ER 47.5 mane, perindopril 5 mane, met XR 500 nocte, atorva 20 nocte, thyroxine 75 mcg mane, alendronate 70 weekly, Ca/Vit D bd, paracetamol 1g bd most days. No NSAIDs/opioids.  

O/E:  
Thin elderly lady, mobilises slowly, uses arms to push from chair.  
BP 132/68 HR 76 irreg irreg RR16 SpO₂ 98% RA afeb BMI 21  
Gait cautious, mild balance issue.  
Hips: full ROM, mild pain end range. Knees: mild OA changes, no effusion.  
LL power hip flex/abd ~4+/5, rest 5/5. Sens intact. No focal neuro deficit.  

Impr:  
1) Gen MSK pain + fatigue in context frailty / OA / deconditioning. No red flags for malignancy/inflamm/spinal cord. Statin myopathy less likely but ?proximal sx → check CK.  
2) Frailty – likely progressed slightly (↓mobility, near fall, effort rising from chair).  
3) Multimorbidity on polypharm – overall stable but warfarin INR variability ?↓intake/vit K.  

Plan:  
Pain/function  
- Cont paracetamol 1g bd–tid PRN (max 4g/d)  
- Avoid NSAIDs (warfarin/age)  
- Mattress likely minor contrib only – suggested trial extra topper (pt aware)  
- Refer PN/exercise phys/physio program (practice-based) → focus LL strength, gait/balance, home ex program  

Frailty/nutrition  
- Briefly discussed frailty concept and role of ex + protein intake  
- Check wt trend next visit  
- Encourage small freq protein-rich meals ± 1 ONS drink/d if poor appetite persists  

Meds  
- Atorva 20: discussed statin myopathy features.  
  → Order CK, LFTs today. If CK↑ or sx worsen → consider ↓dose or trial cease with CVD risk/benefit discussion next review.  
- Warfarin: counselled re variable vit K intake / ↓appetite affecting INR. Asked to keep diet as consistent as poss + keep INR clinic informed.  
- Full med rationalisation → book long f/up 2–3/52 (frailty/ACP review)  

Ix (S&N path today):  
- FBC, U&E/eGFR  
- LFT  
- ESR, CRP  
- CK  
- TSH  
- 25-OH Vit D  
Results 1/52 – phone vs short appt depending  

Falls/safety  
- Advised trial walking stick for outdoors uneven ground (will try daughter’s).  
- Brief home falls advice.  

Future planning  
- Pt raised Q re frailty scale + impact on chemo/ICU etc. Deferred detailed ACP/goals-of-care to long appt; plan CFS reassessment, med review, hospital/ICU prefs with daughter present if poss.  

F/up:  
- 1/52 short appt for results + pain plan tweak  
- 30min f/up 2–3/52 for frailty/multimorbidity/ACP  
- Red flags explained – seek urgent review/000 if new severe pain, CP, SOB, sudden weakness, fall with injury or confusion.
