79F Wiradjuri. Ret comm health worker. AHW + granddaughter in.  

CC: itchy rash arms x ~2/52  

HPC  
Itchy papular rash both forearms + dorsum hands ± a few spots lower legs. Worse at night. “Drives me mad scratching”. No blisters / weeping. No fevers, systemically well.  
No new Rx meds. ↑ use “cheap washing powder / soap from Woolies”. Very dry skin.  

Granddaughter: clothes looser, ↓ appetite months. Pt: “just tea and toast most days” “no energy”. Known frailty, mets breast Ca, dementia dev delay. Multiple missed oncology / memory appts.  

Meds – poor adherence  
Letrozole, Vit D, Ca, donepezil, analgesia – often missed / ran out “few weeks ago”. Granddaughter confirms Webster packs lost / not picked up.  

O/E (focused)  
BP 118/66 HR 78 afebrile wt 46kg (↓ from 51kg ~10/12 ago) BMI ~18  
Skin forearms/hands: scattered erythematous excoriated papules, some linear scratch marks. No vesicles / pustules / burrows / scale. Legs dry, few similar lesions. No obvious infection.  
Looks thin, mildly frail, slow with stick. Oriented to person/place, not date.  

IMP  
1) Pruritic papular dermatitis – ?irritant/contact + xerotic eczema. No clear scabies, no drug rash, no infection  
2) Frailty with wt loss + sarcopenia in context mets breast Ca (pall) + dementia + dev delay  
3) Mets breast Ca on pall plan – likely off letrozole for weeks  
4) Dementia + dev disability → poor adherence, needs carer support  
5) Non-adherence meds + appts – ongoing issue  

PLAN  
Skin  
- Hydrocortisone 1% cream BD to affected areas up to 7–10/7 then PRN (PBS)  
- Emollient: sorbolene / similar BD esp post-shower  
- Avoid irritants: advise change to sensitive laundry powder + soap-free wash  
- Cetirizine 10mg nocte PRN severe itch (caution falls / sedation – granddaughter to monitor)  
- RTC/ED if rash spreads fast, blisters, weeps, fever, others in house itchy (→ consider scabies)  

Frailty / wt loss / Ca  
- Explained likely multifactorial (age/frailty + Ca).  
- Simple nutrition advice: small freq high-protein snacks, oral supplement (Sustagen/Ensure OD if can afford) – AHW to help re subsidised options  
- Restart Vit D3 1000 IU mane (new script – falls/frailty)  
- Basic strength/mobility within tolerance; offered comm physio / EP → referral sent, AHW to help with booking, may DNA  

Meds  
- Today prioritised: Vit D, analgesia, Ca if tolerated.  
- Letrozole: to discuss with oncology re ongoing benefit given frailty / goals of care  
- Clinic pharmacist + AHW to organise Webster packs + home delivery via local pharmacy to ↓ “ran out”  

Cancer / pall / supports  
- Granddaughter: “we didn’t get around to oncology, Nan didn’t want to go”  
- With pt consent AHW to contact oncology + local pall care to see if community review / outreach instead of hospital clinic  

Ix (done today – AHW walked pt to path)  
- FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, CMP, Vit D, B12, TFTs – r/o reversible causes fatigue/wt loss/pruritus  

Risk  
- Known frailty + falls + cognitive impairment. No red flags today, pain ok, no delirium.  

F/U  
- Booked long GP + AHW 1–2/52: review rash, bloods, frailty status, full med rationalisation / deprescribing, start goals-of-care / ACP with family  
- Ask reception/AHW to ring granddaughter 1–2 days prior as reminder  
- Earlier review if ↑ confusion, ↓ PO intake, falls, uncontrolled pain, rash worse or any concern from family
