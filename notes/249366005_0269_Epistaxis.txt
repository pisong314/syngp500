29F teacher. Hx allergic rhinitis.  

CC: “more snot + a bit of blood last few days”  

HPI  
5–6/7 ↑clear→yellow nasal d/c + congestion L>R. Long hx hay fever. Worse am + at school, better at home.  
Small vol epistaxis x3/7 – streaks of bright red in mucus when blowing nose 1–2x/day. One brief L-sided drip y/day post hot shower, stopped <3 mins with pressure. Nil clots, nil large vol. Nil nocturnal bleed.  
Assoc sneezing, itchy eyes, mild PND.  
-denies facial pain, severe uni obstruction, toothache, fever, systemic sx  
-denies SOB, CP, palps, dizziness  
RAT y/day -ve.  

Meds: cetirizine 10 mg mane (reg), saline nasal spray PRN. Not using IN steroid now (prev fluticasone last spring). No anticoag, antiplatelet, NSAID. NKDA.  

Likely triggers: windy playground duty, heater + fan overnight (dry), strong eucalyptus cleaning spray at school.  

O/E (phone only)  
Speaking full sentences, no ↑WOB over phone. Pt describes bleed as small vol, anterior, intermittent, settles with simple pressure. No features c/w posterior bleed (no large vol, no blood into throat, no presyncope). No facial/periorbital swelling, no visual change.  

Impression  
1) Mild anterior epistaxis 2° mucosal irritation/dryness on background allergic rhinitis. Low concern serious pathology / bleeding disorder (small vol, self-limiting, clear triggers, no other bleeding/bruising).  
2) Allergic rhinitis – suboptimally controlled (↑exposure allergens/irritants, off IN steroid).  

Plan  
- Epistaxis: explained simple first aid – sit up, lean fwd, pinch soft part nose 10–15 mins, spit out blood. Avoid vigorous nose blowing / picking.  
- Nasal care: start soft white paraffin ointment very thin smear to ant septum/nostrils bd esp nocte. Continue saline spray PRN. Try ↓direct heater/fan to face.  
- Allergic rhinitis:  
  • Continue cetirizine 10 mg mane  
  • Restart fluticasone propionate IN 50 mcg: 2 sprays each nostril mane x1/52 then ↓ to 1 spray each nostril mane during high-allergen periods. Technique discussed (aim away from septum, gentle sniff).  
  • Adv to minimise strong cleaning sprays at work if poss, consider mask on windy/high pollen days.  

Safety net  
ED/000 if bleed >20 mins continuous despite pressure, large vol, light-headed, SOB, blood running down throat/vomiting blood, or breathing difficulty.  
RTC/FTF earlier if ↑freq or heavy epistaxis, new uni obstruction, facial pain, purulent d/c, or other bleeding/bruising/menorrhagia.  

F/up  
Book non-urgent FTF 1–2/52 to review epistaxis + rhinitis control and check spray technique.  

Time ~12 mins phone – focused nasal sx only. Pt mentioned “bit tired end of term” – advised separate appt if ongoing.
