32F Anglo-Aus  

CC: “bit wobbly and clumsy” x ~3/52  

HPC  
Known Chiari I (dx 20s, last neurosurg Melb ~2023 – mild tonsillar herniation, no syrinx, no cord compression, cons mx).  
3/52 intermittent unsteadiness walking (esp supermarket aisles / uneven ground). No falls.  
Dropping things R hand “3–4 times this week”.  
Feels “spacey and tired” end of day.  
No clear trigger – ↑computer, new higher office chair, ↑coffee per pt.  
Fluctuating sx, some good days.  
- neck pain -ve, no trauma, no manipulation  
- no Lhermitte, no new H/A, no occipital or cough/Valsalva H/A  
- no visual ∆, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, facial weakness  
- no limb weakness, walking OK, stairs OK  
- sensory sx essentially -ve (only long-standing positional pins/needles hands)  
- no bladder/bowel issues, no saddle anaesthesia  
- no recent infx, wt loss, sweats  
Driving OK, no near misses. “Probably nothing but wanted to be safe.”  

PMHx  
Chiari I only. No meds. NKDA. Non-smoker.  

O/E  
Obs WNL (BP 114/72, HR 74 reg, afebrile, SpO₂ 99% RA, BMI ~23). Well, mildly anxious.  
Neuro:  
A&O, speech normal. CN II–XII grossly intact.  
Tone/bulk nl, power 5/5 all limbs, no pronator drift.  
Reflexes 2+ throughout, plantars flexor, no clonus.  
Sensation LT/pinprick intact, vib/prop grossly OK.  
Coord: FNF normal; heel–shin mildly slow R only, L normal. RAM – very mild clumsiness R hand vs L but functional.  
Gait: normal base, arm swing. Tandem – slight wobble first go then OK. Romberg -ve.  
Neck full ROM, non-tender. CVS/resp/abdo NAD.  

Impression  
Chiari I with new very mild R-sided coordination issue + intermittent unsteadiness  
→ no objective weakness, no clear ataxia, no UMN signs, no sensory level, no sphincter ∆  
No current red flags for acute cord compression but new neuro sx in known Chiari → needs re-imaging, re-link neurosurg.  

Plan  
- MRI brain + whole C-spine w contrast – semi-urgent (within 1–2/52) to r/o syrinx / new cord compression / Chiari progression.  
- Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, B12, folate, TFTs (r/o metabolic causes fatigue/unsteadiness).  
- Refer back neurosurg (regional clinic) – routine but request early review, attach MRI req + 2023 letter.  
- ED if red flags: sudden/worsening neck pain (esp trauma), new weakness/numbness or electric shock sx with neck flexion, falls/difficulty walking, bladder/bowel loss or retention, severe occipital H/A w vomiting/visual ∆.  
- Adv: cont usual ADLs as tolerated, avoid high-impact/contact sports / trampolines / extreme neck flex/ext / neck manipulation until imaging + review. Gentle walking/yoga OK (avoid forced neck positions).  
- Coffee/ergonomics discussed briefly – unlikely primary cause; can trial ↓caffeine, adjust chair/desk.  
- Preventive “general check-up” deferred – asked to book long appt later.  

F/U  
Review 1–2/52 with MRI + bloods or earlier if sx ↑ / new neuro signs. If MRI abnormal (syrinx / cord compression / Chiari progression) → urgent neurosurg. If MRI normal & sx stable/improving → consider physio (posture/neck), sleep/fatigue strategies.  

RTC sooner / ED if worse.
