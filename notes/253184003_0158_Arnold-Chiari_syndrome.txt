Telehealth (video) – f/up  

32F Melb  

Cc: cough ~10d + h/o Chiari I  

Hx:  
Dry → now int prod clear/white sputum  
Worse noc + talking  
No SOB, no wheeze, no CP, “tight lungs”  
No fevers/chills, URTI sx mostly settled  
COVID RAT d2 + d5 both -ve (home)  
Non-smoker, no asthma, no reflux hx  
Very fixated “it’s from my Chiari / brainstem”, wants “full scans of neck + lungs today”  

Neuro/Chiari:  
Known Chiari I dx ~5y, f/up neurosurg (tertiary), last MRI ~18/12 ago “stable no surg yet”  
Longstanding occipital/upper neck discomfort baseline  
Intermittent Lhermitte-type “electric shocks” neck flexion x years, no change  
Denies new limb wk/numb/clumsy, gait change, sphincter issues, new severe neck pain, new/unusual HA  
No trauma/falls/chiro/neck manipulation  

Meds: PRN paracetamol only  
All: NKDA  

Tele exam (limited):  
On screen: alert, talking full sentences, mildly agitated but NAD  
RR ~14–16, no ↑WOB, no audible wheeze/stridor, occasional dry cough  
Face sym, moves UL freely, turns head R/L (avoids full flex/ext as usual)  

Imp:  
1) Subacute cough 10d – likely post-viral URTI / transient airway hyper-responsiveness. No red flag resp features on hx or video. COVID less likely (2x -ve RAT)  
2) Arnold–Chiari I – known, no new red flag neuro sx, no evidence acute decomp on hx/obs (telehealth limits)  
3) High health anxiety / mistrust, very scan-focused, difficult therapeutic engagement  

Ix:  
No imaging today – low suspicion PNA/PE/cardiac, stable over video  
Offered in-person for chest exam/vitals → pt declined (“waste of time unless MRI”)  
Plan CXR if cough not improving 1–2/52 or new sx → will arrange then  
No bloods today  

Mx:  
Explained likely post-viral course, may last wks; no indication for “full body MRI incl neck + chest” as requested – discussed stepwise approach  
Symptomatic only: fluids, honey etc (OTC). Suggested simple linctus / benzydamine gargle PRN – pt may try  
Sedating antihistamine at night (e.g. promethazine) discussed re nocturnal cough + sedation/driving – pt not keen (“makes me hungover”) so not prescribed  
Advised minimise irritants incl smoke/strong chems/mould exposure where possible; suggested contact landlord re mould – doesn’t change acute plan  

Chiari safety-net (reiterated):  
Urgent ED/same-day review if:  
– New/worse neck pain esp post trauma  
– New limb wk/numb/clumsiness, dropping objects, gait/balance change  
– New bladder/bowel incontinence or retention  
– Marked ↑ in electric-shock sensations or constant severe sx  
Encouraged routine neurosurg f/up given MRI ~18/12 ago – advised to ring rooms to check next review. Pt reluctant (“they fob me off”) but will “think about it”  

Resp safety-net:  
ED / urgent review if SOB, CP, haemoptysis, high fever, confusion, feels acutely unwell  
Otherwise RTC/TH appt 7–10d if cough persists or earlier if worse. Strongly encouraged F2F next if not improving for chest + full neuro exam – pt says might come in next wk if still bad  

Time limited – neck pain/ergonomics deferred → needs longer F2F appt for chronic Chiari/neck issues.
