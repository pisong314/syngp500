Stool PCR: norovirus +ve. Salmonella/Shigella/Campy/C.diff/Giardia/Crypto etc -ve  

Dx  
1) Acute viral gastroenteritis (norovirus) – resolving  
2) Probable transient lactose intolerance post‑gastro  

Plan  
– Reassured viral aetiology, no C.diff / parasites / bacterial pathogen.  
– Supportive only: fluids, simple diet, avoid ETOH/caffeine excess.  
– Loperamide PRN short‑term once clearly improving, avoid if blood in stool/fever/↑pain.  
– Trial lactose ↓/avoid x2/52 → lactose‑free milk, hard cheese ok, can use OTC lactase tabs PRN.  
– If not back to baseline ~4/52 or new red flags (wt loss, nocturnal D, PR blood/mucus, persistent pain) → review, consider coeliac serology, stool calprotectin, further Ix.  

Work / infection control  
– HCW: off work until ≥48h after last V/D. Last watery stool y/day, today only loose. Likely RTW 1–2d if no further watery D.  
– Emphasised strict hand hygiene, bathroom cleaning etc.  
– Med cert provided for current absence.  

F/up  
– RTC 1–2/52 if bowels not clearly improving or sooner if worse (fever, severe focal abdo pain, blood in stool, can’t keep fluids down, ↓urine, dizziness)  
– Pt also mentioned fatigue from shift work + colleagues’ illness – asked to book longer appt once gastro settled if ongoing.
