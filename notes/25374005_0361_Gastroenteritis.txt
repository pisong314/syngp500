A  
1) Acute gastroenteritis likely viral vs foodborne  
- Mild–mod dehydration only clinically stable  
- Pattern + short hx + nbnb V+D no blood/mucus no travel → self limiting gastro most likely  
- Nil features acute abdo sepsis or surgical pathology currently  

2) Acute rhinitis likely viral URTI vs allergic rhinitis exacerbation conc@work  
- Sneezing clear rhinorrhoea itch suggest allergic yet concurrent GI illness makes viral more likely  
- Nil evidence bacterial sinusitis or LRTI  

P  
1) Gastroenteritis  
- Oral rehydration encourage small freq sips ORS water avoid high sugar soft drink undiluted juice initially simple diet as tol  
- Temp ↓ lactose intake 5–7/7 or until stools normal lactose free milk or avoid large dairy serves  
- Meds  
  • Ondansetron ODT 4mg 1 tab up to TDS PRN N/V disp 10 no rpt PBS  
  • Loperamide not today given short hx allow gut to clear may consider if needs to work and D persists >24h no red flags  
- Ix  
  • Nil immediate stool MCS/PCR given short duration no blood/mucus no travel systemically well  
  • If sx >5–7/7 high fever blood in stool or cluster cases at cafe → stool MCS + faecal PCR  
- Safety net  
  • Advise ED / urgent r/v if unable to keep fluids down >6h ↓ urine output or very dark urine severe or localised abdo pain high fever/rigors blood or mucus in stool persistent vomiting drowsiness chest pain SOB or feels markedly more unwell than expected  

2) Rhinitis / URTI  
- Continue saline nasal spray  
- Start intranasal corticosteroid  
  • Mometasone nasal spray 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril mane max benefit after several days  
- Oral antihistamine  
  • Cetirizine 10mg mane PRN for itch/sneezing advised may be less effective if mainly viral  
- Discussed difficulty distinguishing viral vs allergic this early mx largely supportive either way  
- Repeat RAT in 24–48h if URTI sx persist follow workplace COVID protocols  

3) Work / social  
- Med cert for 2/7 off work to rest ↓ transmission esp in food handling
