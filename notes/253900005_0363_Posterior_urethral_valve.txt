Examination:  
Obs: BP 118/72, HR 76 reg, RR 14, Temp 36.7, SpO2 99% RA  
Gen: Well, NAD, talkative, tangetnial at times  
Skin: multiple small 2–5mm erythematous slightly raised papules over upper ant chest/shoulders, scattered dorsal forearms. Some coalescing into small patches. Mild excoriation. No vesicels, no pustules, no crusting, no target lesions, no purpura. Face/palms/soles/mucosa spared.

Abdo: soft, NT, no mass, no suprapubic distension, no CVA tender  

Ix:  
- UEC, Cr, eGFR ordered via SNP – no recent bloods in our system (last >18m ago, results not avail)  
- Urine ACR form given (1st morning)  
- MSU MCS form given to use if develops urinary symtpoms  
- Will request urology letters from tertiary cntr (none recent on file)  

Impression:  
1) Irritant/contact/heat dermatitis – likely 2º new synthetic hi‑vis + sweating, poss contrib from new body wash. No red flag features.  
2) PUV – longstanding, clinically stable today by hx, but at risk CKD; overdue routine renal monitoring.  
3) Tangential historian – will need longer appt for detailed PUV/renal reveiw.  

Plan:  
Rash:  
- Cease new body wash, use plain/fragrance‑free soap/soap‑free  
- Cotton singlet/undershirt under hi‑vis, consider alt work shirt if ongoing  
- Hydrocortisone 1% crm bd thin layer to affected areas up to 7–10 days then prn  
- Emollient (e.g. sorbolene) bd + after showers  
- OTC non‑sedating antihistamine (e.g. cetirizine 10mg nocte prn itch)  

PUV / renal:  
- Reinforced need good hydration (more water, less energy drinks), avoid prolonged holding urine as able  
- Non‑urgent bloods as above; review results  
- RTC/ED if new/worse voiding difficulty, marked ↓ output, suprapubic/loin pain, fever/rigors, haematuria, incontinence, feels generally very crook  

Follow‑up:  
- Review 1–2 wks if rash not settling or earlier if spreads, blisters, mucosal involvment, fever, facial/tongue swelling or breathing issues  
- Book long appt (20–30 min) in 4–6 wks for: blood/urine results + more detailed PUV/renal assesment and plan  

Pt able to repeat key red flags though still a bit tangetnial in convo.
