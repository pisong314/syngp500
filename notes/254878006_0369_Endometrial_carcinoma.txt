O/E (brief)  
Looks well, rushing but NAD  
BP 128/76 HR 78 reg RR 14 SpO₂ 98% RA T 36.6  
Chest clear, HS I+II, no focal neuro on obs  

A  
1) Need for imms – COVID booster + annual flu. Hx malignancy ↑risk but not on active chemo now  
2) Endometrial Ca – post definitive Rx, in f/up, currently asx, no red flags today  
3) Multiple preventive issues outstanding but pt time-poor  

P  
1) Vax today  
   - Checked no prior anaphylaxis, no acute illness  
   - COVID-19 booster (latest mRNA per ATAGI for >60 + Ca hx) IM L deltoid  
   - Influenza vax (QIV) IM R deltoid  
   - Explained need to wait post vax; pt reluctant “I really don’t have time to sit around” → negotiated 10 mins obs in WR, agreed  
   - Paracetamol PRN post vax if sore, RTC/ED if SOB, facial swelling, feels very crook  

2) Endometrial Ca f/up  
   - Confirmed next gynae-onc appt ~3/12 at tertiary centre  
   - Briefly advised not to delay even if work busy  
   - Red flags: PV bleed, new pelvic/abdo pain, change bowel/bladder, unexplained wt loss, persistent ↑fatigue → see GP earlier  
   - Pt tried to park discussion “can we not go into all that now” → will book longer review later  

3) Other prevention (deferred)  
   - Mentioned Shingrix + pneumococcal due given age + Ca hx → pt: “let’s park that”  
   - Advised longer GP appt in next 1–2/12 for preventive check (zoster, pneumo, CVD screen, survivorship issues). Verbal “yeah maybe when work settles down”  

4) F/up  
   - Nurse obs post vax – no immediate reaction (see nursing notes)  
   - GP review 2–3/12 (std or long) for Ca survivorship + preventive care + outstanding vax  
   - Earlier PRN if post-vax issues or any gynae red flags / feeling more unwell
