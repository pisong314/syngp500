Results (reviewed – prev ordered for fatigue/low mood) – Sullivan Nicolaides  
FBC: Hb 129, MCV 90, WCC/Plt nl  
U&E/CMP: eGFR 85, rest nl  
LFTs nl  
TSH 1.9 (nl)

→ No obvious reversible metabolic cause for fatigue/low mood  

A  
MDD – moderate, partial response to sertraline 100 mg, no current SI, good protective factors  
Huntington’s dz – neuro stable, f/up neuro as arranged  
Cerebrovascular dz – on 2° prevention, control reasonable today  
Fatigue – multifactorial (mood + poor sleep + chronic neuro)  

P  
– Discussed results, reassured re thyroid/iron etc  
– Cont sertraline 100 mg mane. Explain only ~6/52 at this dose, may need more time  
   Consider ↑ to 150 mg if still low next review – pt prefers “see how we go” for now  
– Plan PHQ-9 + MHCP at longer appt (time today)  
– Safety: no SI. Crisis plan given: if mood worse / any SI → same-day review, after-hours GP or ED  
– Sleep: advised ↓ caffeine pm, reg routine. Noise issue – suggested discuss with neighbour/body corp if ongoing  
– Offered psych (CBT, adj to chronic illness) under MHCP – pt hesitant “don’t want to take up their time” but will think about it  

Neuro/CVD  
– Cont aspirin, atorvastatin, perindopril  
– Monitor for new balance/speech/swallow/cog changes → low threshold to call/see/neuro  
– Full CV risk review, cancer screening, MSK “stiff in mornings” to separate appt – no time today  

Ix  
No new bloods today (recent set all satisfactory)  
Consider psych/psych-neuro referral if poor response next few months  

F/up  
Book long appt 2–3/52: MHCP + PHQ-9, review mood/sleep/fatigue, consider sertraline ↑, chronic dz review if time  
RTC earlier if deterioration mood, any SI, new neuro sx
