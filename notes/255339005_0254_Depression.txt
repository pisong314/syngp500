49F f/up mood  

Hx: known dep/anx, Huntington’s, RA. On sertraline 50 mane ~6/12, poor adherence (misses 2–3/wk “if I’m running late I just skip it”). Last few wks ↓mood “flat all the time”, anhedonia, ↓motivation, ↓energy, ↓concentration at work, more mistakes. Sleep poor – diff getting off + early waking 3–4am, ruminating. ↓appetite, ?few kg wt loss. ↑worry re work + future “with this Huntington’s hanging over me”. No ETOH, 2–3 coffees/d.  

Passive death thoughts “wouldn’t matter if I didn’t wake up” but denies active SI/plan/intent. No SH. No psychosis. No hx mania/hypomania.  

Meds (pt report): sertraline 50 mane, MTX weekly (dose ?), folate, ibuprofen PRN. NKDA.  

Obs: BP 126/78 HR 78 afebrile sats 99% RA.  

MSE: looks tired, mildly slowed, cooperative. Speech soft. Mood “flat”, affect constricted. TP linear. TC hopelessness re Huntington’s, no psychotic content. No AVH. Cogn grossly OK. Insight fair.  

Neuro: mild choreiform finger mvmts (baseline). Hands with established RA changes, no acute flare.  

Dx:  
1) MDD – recurrent, mod, partial Rx only (low dose SSRI + non-adherent)  
2) GAD – worsened but 2° to above  
3) Huntington’s dz – known, contributing to outlook  
4) RA – stable today  

Plan:  
– ↑ sertraline 50 → 100 mg mane with food (PBS). Emphasise daily use, suggest blister near toothbrush/phone as cue  
– Warned re SEs (GI, ↑anx early, HA, sexual dysfxn). Expect effect 2–4/52, full up to 6–8/52  
– Path today (bulk bill): FBC, U&E, LFT, TSH, B12, folate, ESR/CRP, fasting lipids + BSL (screen + r/o med causes fatigue/low mood)  
– Psych: pt reluctant (“don’t like talking to strangers” + cost). Will organise GP MHTP + refer to bulk-billing psych next long appt if agrees  
– Safety: discussed. If ↑SI/plan or feels unsafe → 000/ED. Given Lifeline/crisis nos on AVS. RTC urgently if mood worse or SEs bad  

Other: encourage re-engage neurology + rheum – will chase letters + do referrals next visit (time).  

F/up: 1/52 long – review mood, SEs, adherence, path results, do GP MHTP + psych referral, sort MTX dose + neuro f/up. Earlier PRN if any risk concerns.  

Pt able to repeat plan, still minimises (“I’m sure it’ll settle but I’ll try the higher dose”). Agrees to f/up.
