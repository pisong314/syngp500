72M f/up – L shoulder pain + VT / heart meds  

Known VT + ICD, CAD, LVSD (EF ~35% per cards letter 4/12 ago). Retired sparkie.  

HPC  
L shoulder ache ~3–4/52, gradual, no trauma. Lat/anterolat → upper arm, not past elbow. “Like I’ve slept funny on it”, 3–5/10. Worse OH reach (washing, jacket), behind back, lying on L at night. Better rest, heat, Panadol 1g PRN “takes the edge off”. ADLs mostly ok, avoiding OH stuff, still driving. No true weak, no numb/tingle.  
Denies CP, jaw/arm exertional pain, SOB, presyn/syncope, palps. Pt worried “is this putting extra strain on the ticker?” Reassured MSK pattern.  

VT / cardiac  
ICD in situ (2 yrs). No shocks “no zaps I’ve noticed”. No recent palps, presyn, syncope, CP, PND, orthop. Mild stable DOE on hills >12/12 unchanged. No recent admits.  
Meds taking “every day like you said” – amio + BB etc, no missed doses. Mild hand tremor + photosens “should I be worried?” – likely amio SE, monitor. No visual Sx, wt change, cough.  

PMHx  
- Sustained VT + structural heart disease – ICD  
- CAD (prev NSTEMI, PCI x1)  
- LV systolic dysfunction  
- HTN  
- HLD  

Meds (confirmed)  
Amiodarone 200 mg mane  
Metoprolol XR 47.5 mg mane  
Perindopril 5 mg mane  
Spironolactone 25 mg mane  
Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte  
Aspirin 100 mg mane  
Paracetamol PRN  
NKDA  

O/E  
Gen well, NAD, speaking full sentences.  
BP 126/72 HR 62 reg RR 14 SpO₂ 98% RA afeb.  
CVS dual HS, no added, JVP↓, no oedema.  
Resp clear.  
L shoulder: no deform/swelling. TTP greater tuberosity / subacromial. Active abd limited ~90–100° w pain, flexn limited >shoulder ht, IR↓ (can’t reach behind back well). Passive slightly > but painful mid‑arc. +ve painful arc 70–120, +ve Hawkins, +ve Neer. Jobe mildly painful, power ~N. ER power preserved. Distal NV intact. Neck full ROM, non‑tender.  

ECG 12‑lead today  
SR ~60, old Q waves c/w prev MI, no acute ischaemia, no VT, QTc ok (not clearly ↑).  

A  
1) L shoulder pain → likely rotator cuff tendinopathy / subacromial impingement, atraumatic, preserved power, classic painful arc. No red flags. Pattern mech, not cardiac, angina equiv unlikely.  
2) VT + structural heart disease, ICD – stable, no recent Sx, on amio + BB per cards.  
3) CAD + LVSD – stable on current HF regimen.  
4) Amiodarone / HF med monitoring – due bloods, not done today (time).  

P  
L shoulder  
- Dx explained briefly – “more the tendon, not the heart” – pt happy  
- Analgesia: cont paracetamol up to 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/day). Avoid oral NSAIDs (CAD/LVSD/ACEi + spiro).  
- Ok to trial topical NSAID gel to L shoulder bd–qid PRN if skin ok.  
- Showed pendulum + gentle assisted flexn/ER in room; printout given (Physitrack – printer jammed first time).  
- Refer local physio (PHN/remote allied health) – rotator cuff + scap stab program.  

Ix / monitoring  
- Imaging deferred (no trauma, typical impingement). If no better 4–6/52 → consider L shoulder USS vs XR.  
- Amio/HF monitoring next long appt: TFT, LFT, U&E, Mg, FBC, lipids, BSL/HbA1c ± CXR if not done <12/12 (can’t see on file since 03/05/2023 15/08/2024).  

Cardiac safety‑net  
- Continue current cardiac meds unchanged.  
- ED / 000 if: new palps + dizzy/CP/SOB, any ICD shock “zap”, collapse or near‑syncope.  

F/U  
- GP review 3–4/52 re shoulder + physio progress, earlier if ↑pain, ↓ROM, neuro Sx.  
- Separate long CDM review 2–3/52 for VT/CAD/LVSD + amio monitoring – will do path forms then (ran out of time today).
