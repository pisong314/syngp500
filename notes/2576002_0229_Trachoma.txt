HPI: 3–4/52 ↑fatigue, "heavy limbs", needs day naps. Still working FT. Sleep ~7h, no snoring/apnoea per partner. Denies low mood/anhedonia. Appetite ok, ?1–2kg wt ↓ over 2/12. No CP, SOB, palps, fevers, night sweats, GI or neuro sx. Menses regular, not preg (LMP ~10d ago, condoms). Pt asking re thyroid + "adrenals".  

Eyes: known trachoma dx ~3y ago via screening, prev community azithro x2. No ophthal review yet. 2–3/52 ↑bilat red, gritty, mild mucous esp AM. No photophobia, no acute ↓VA, no severe pain. Worried re scarring/trichiasis.  

Meds: nil reg. Occ ibuprofen. Started OTC iron intermittently last wk. No eye drops. NKDA.  

O/E:  
Obs WNL (BP 118/72 HR 76 afebrile SpO₂ 99% RA) BMI 24  
Looks tired, NAD, no obvious pallor/jaundice  
Eyes: mild bilat conjunctival injection, follicles + mild tarsal scarring UL, no obvious trichiasis/entropion, corneas clear grossly, mild mucous at canthi. VA ~6/6 R, 6/9 L (pt says baseline). No photophobia.  
Neck: no goitre. CVS/resp/abdo/neuro grossly NAD.  

Ix ordered (SNP path):  
- FBC + film  
- Iron studies (ferritin, iron, transf sat)  
- UEC, LFT  
- TSH, FT4  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
- CRP  
Results pending  

A:  
1) Fatigue 3–4/52, no red flags. ddx: IDA/other anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, early DM, work/stress-related fatigue. No clinical features of adrenal insuff.  
2) Trachoma – recurrent, mild active follicular conjunctivitis + early scarring, no trichiasis/corneal involvement today. From endemic area, high exposure. Needs systemic abx + ophthal FU.  

P:  
1) Fatigue  
- As above Ix today → review when results back (telehealth ok if remote)  
- Discussed "adrenal fatigue" – explained not evidence-based, no current indication for cortisol.  
- Gen advice re sleep/caffeine/fluids briefly discussed.  

2) Trachoma  
- Doxycycline 100mg PO bd 7/7 (not preg, condoms). PBS script.  
  Couns: take with food + water, stay upright, photosensitivity → hat/sunscreen, GI SEs discussed.  
- Consider azithro 1g stat future if adherence issues/community round, but pt prefers doxy now.  
- Ophthalmology referral (routine, within 1–2/12) for full assessment, scarring/trichiasis risk, ongoing plan.  

Admin/billing: Std consult, bulk billed. SNP forms given.  

Safety net: RTC/ED if sudden ↓vision, severe eye pain, marked photophobia, FB/scratching sensation; or fatigue ↑ with SOB, CP, palps, syncope, fevers, wt loss.  

F/U: 1–2/52 with results + check response to doxy + confirm ophthal appt. Longer appt later for CVD risk + vax update (pt requested).
