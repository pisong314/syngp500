Pain 4–6/10 walking worse stairs uneven ground still working reduced WB  
Using compression bandage ice intermittently elev PM  
Taking paracetamol 1g BD and ibuprofen 400mg BD PRN good effect  

?re ligament vs fracture she has read NICE ankle sprain guideline asking re brace vs taping when to start proprioceptive ex  
Also ?if new runners with different heel drop contributed  
Nil fall from height nil head strike nil other trauma nil midfoot pain nil knee pain nil numbness tingling weakness or giving way nil fever redness wounds

A  
1 R lat ankle sprain likely grade I–II ATFL/CFL 2° inversion injury  
   Improving sx 6/7 post injury low suspicion fracture nil red flags imaging not indicated today per Ottawa  
2 R knee OA + prev medial meniscal injury with haemarthroses currently stable risk of flare if prolonged limp  
3 Highly health literate very engaged wants evidence based rehab  

P  
1 R ankle sprain  
- Explained mechanism usual course most better 2–4/52 but full recovery incl proprioception may take 6–12/52  
- Reassured exam c/w lig sprain not fracture discussed Ottawa criteria pt happy to avoid XR today  
- POLICE  
  • Protection / optimal loading continue relative rest keep walking within pain limits avoid running jumping uneven surfaces short term  
  • Ice 15–20min q2–3h PRN next few days  
  • Compression continue elastic bandage / ankle sleeve avoid o/n if uncomfortable  
  • Elevation when resting  
- Analgesia  
  • Advised can ↑ paracetamol to 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food up to ~5–7/7 if no GI or renal issues avoid other NSAIDs  
- Functional rehab  
  • Start gentle AROM now eg ankle alphabets PF/DF within comfort 3–4x/day  
  • From ~day 7–10 progress to light resistance + balance eg single leg stand near bench as tolerated  
  • Gave verbal advice + suggested Healthdirect / Better Health ankle sprain resources for ex ideas  

- Support  
  • Discussed taping vs semi rigid brace pros/cons cost practicality  
  • Plan short term off the shelf ankle brace esp at work for 2–3/52 plus active rehab  

- Imaging  
  • Nil XR today  
  • MRI only if persisting pain or instability beyond expected course or ?osteochondral / syndesmotic injury  

2 R knee OA / meniscal hx  
- Knee currently settled nil effusion locking  
- Advised minimise limp aim for symmetrical gait as pain allows to protect knee  
- Resume knee strengthening / home physio once ankle a bit beter  
- Suggested longer OA r/v in 1–2/12 once ankle improved re global joint health wt exercise analgesia options pt agreeable  

Safety net  
- Red flags discussed ↑ pain/swelling inability WB at all after another week new deformity redness heat fever neuro sx or recurrent giving way  
- If not much beter in 2–3/52 or still unstable at ~6/52 → consider physio ref + ankle XR +/- MRI sports/ortho opinion  

F/U  
- R/V 10–14/7 for ankle reassessment and to check knee not flaring earlier if deterioration
