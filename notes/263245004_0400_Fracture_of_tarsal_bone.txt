Reason for visit  
F/U L foot # and ?bone health in setting of known primary hyperparathyroidism  

HPI  
72yo F Anglo Aust retired admin lives with husband  
Trip on uneven paver in garden ~3.5 wks ago low velocity nil head strike nil LOC  
ED XR: non displaced # tarsometatarsal region L midfoot Lisfranc area managed conservatively CAM boot partial WB with walker  

Today pain much beter  
2–3/10 at rest up to 5/10 with longer walking in boot nil night pain  
Mobilising around house with boot + walker slow but stable  
Analgesia paracetamol 1g bd regular + occas extra eve dose nil NSAIDs  

Nil neuropathic sx nil calf pain nil SOB nil CP nil fevers nil redness or discharge  

Very well read asking if this is minimal trauma # given age + primary hyperpara  
Asks re BMD thresholds bisphosphonate vs denosumab specifically concerned GI SE with oral bisphos  
Cut down dairy last few yrs for cholesterol asks if relevant to bone strength  
Thinks flexible trainers may have contributed foot “rolled inside the shoe”  

Background  
Primary hyperparathyroidism dx ~3 yrs ago after incidental hyperCa followed by tertiary endo told “mild watch and wait”  
Nil specific tx currently  
Last Ca/PTH ~10–11 mths ago not in our system  
Nil prev minimal trauma #  
Menopause 49 nil HRT nil long term steroids  
Non smoker EtOH 0–1 std/wk walks daily when well currently ↓ due to #  
Home single storey nil internal stairs  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1g bd PRN (currently regular)  
Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
Perindopril 5mg mane  
Nil Ca or vit D supps  
Allergies NKDA  

O/E  
Gen alert articulate NAD  
BP 132/74 HR 74 reg RR 14 SpO2 98% RA T 36.6 BMI ~24 (prev)  

L foot boot removed  
Mild swelling dorsum midfoot local TTP over tarsometatarsal region tenderness ↓ cf initial per pt  
Nil deformity nil erythema nil warmth skin intact  
Ankle passive ROM preserved mild discomfort at extremes inversion eversion  
Neurovasc intact CR <2s toes DP/PT palpable sens LT intact  
Calves soft NT nil asymmetry  
Gait in boot with walker slow but steady  

Ix  
Prev ED XR r/v non displaced tarsometatarsal # L foot managed non op  

Today  
QML forms given  
• DXA BMD LS TH FN re ?osteoporosis in context age >70 low velocity # + primary hyperpara  
• FBE UEC LFT CMP incl corr Ca PO4 ALP  
• PTH  
• 25-OH vit D  
• Fasting lipids + glucose opportunistic  

Dx / Assessment  
1 Healing non displaced tarsometatarsal # L foot ~3.5/52 post injury improving pain and function neurovasc intact nil red flags infection or DVT  
2 Likely low trauma # in setting age + primary hyperparathyroidism → ↑ concern underlying osteoporosis  
3 Primary hyperparathyroidism known ?progression no recent biochem needs r/v  
4 Fracture risk / falls risk ↑ short term  

Plan  
#1 L foot # / pain  
– Continue CAM boot partial WB as per ED ortho advice gradual ↑ WB as tolerated avoid uneven surfaces high impact  
– Continue paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h advised to avoid NSAIDs re age renal risk etc  
– If sudden ↑ pain new deformity new erythema warmth fever inability to WB or new calf pain SOB → urgent r/v ED  

– Will consider rpt XR foot ~6/52 if still sig pain or function delayed decide next appt  

#2 Bone health / osteoporosis workup  
– Explained treat this as probable minimal trauma # in her age group so need BMD + bloods prior to starting any antiresorptive  
– Discussed basics of T score FRAX type risk calc in brief  
– Options outlined  
   • Oral bisphos eg alendronate weekly first line if BMD osteopenic/osteoporotic and GI tolerable able to follow dosing  
   • Denosumab 6 monthly s/c alt first line discussed need ongoing therapy and rebound # risk if stopped abruptly  
   • Teriparatide not appropriate in primary hyperpara not indicated now  
– Final decision on meds after DXA + labs at longer r/v  

#3 Primary hyperparathyroidism  
– PTH corr Ca vit D CMP ordered as above  
– Explained hyperpara can ↑ bone turnover ↑ # risk  
– If Ca/PTH still ↑ and/or low BMD will re-refer to endo at tertiary centre re ?parathyroid surgery vs continued obs based on guideline thresholds  
– Pt keen to go through criteria in detail asked to book long appt once results back  

#4 Calcium vit D lifestyle / falls  
– Brief dietary advice aim ~3 serves Ca rich foods/day discussed low fat dairy options and that moderate dairy usually ok with chol esp on statin  
– Vit D level pending will replace if low  
– Encouraged gentle WB activity within pain limits later may ref physio for balance + strength  
– Falls prevention discussed removing trip hazards good lighting esp outdoors  

Admin / billing  
– Path forms QML given  
– DXA referral printed for local imaging service  
– Private billing today standard consult MBS 23 gap $40  

F/U  
– Book long r/v 2–3/52 to go through bloods and DXA if available  
– Earlier r/v if ↑ pain inability to WB systemic sx or if any concernt
