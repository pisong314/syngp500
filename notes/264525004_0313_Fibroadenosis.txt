27yo F – breast lump f/u, wants “breast specialist referral”  

C/o “lumpy breasts” x ~2 yrs, L>R. Previously in Sydney, told fibroadenoma/fibroadenosis, had USS then (no reports today). Now feels L lump “a bit bigger than last year”, over last ~6–9 months, not sudden. Wants imaging + specialist “to be sure it’s nothing nasty”.  

No acute pain, just intermittent dull ache L breast, worse premenstrual, settles with period. No nipple discharge, no skin change, no systemic sx. No trauma/infection. Not on OCP. LMP ~10 days ago, cycles regular.  

Pt wondering if new sports bra / ↑coffee at work making it worse. Reassured re tenderness, not growth.  

Ex  
Vitals: BP 112/70, HR 72 reg, afebrile, BMI ~23. Looks well.  
Breasts (chaperone present, consented):  
- L: ~1.5–2 cm smooth, firm, mobile, non-tender, well-circumscribed lump UOQ ~10 o’clock, 3–4 cm from areola. No overlying skin change.  
- R: generally lumpy, no discrete dominant mass.  
Axillae: no palpable nodes. No supraclav nodes.  

Impression  
- L breast lump in 27F – clinically benign features, likely fibroadenoma/fibroadenosis but subjective ↑size, no prior imaging available → needs repeat USS ± biopsy + specialist review.  
- Mild cyclical mastalgia. No red flag features today.  

Plan (a bit all over the place, limited time)  
- Ordered bilateral breast USS incl axillae (age <30, discrete lump).  
- Note to radiology: if USS suspicious, please proceed to core biopsy as per protocol.  
- Referral done to public breast clinic / general surgeon with breast interest (local service) – include: 27F, 1.5–2 cm mobile L UOQ mass, likely fibroadenoma, slight ↑size over 6–9/12, no alarming features.  
- Pt to sign release form to get old Sydney breast USS/report for comparison.  
- Simple analgesia PRN for premenstrual discomfort; can trial ↓caffeine if wants.  
- Briefly discussed screening: routine BreastScreen from 50, earlier imaging only if symptomatic/high risk. Defer broader cancer screening/contraception chat to separate appt – she keen to book later.  

F/U  
- Review after USS (2–4/52) or earlier if rapid enlargement, new nipple discharge, skin change, new lump/axillary node.  
- Pt says understands and will book as soon as scan done.  

Billing: standard Level B, bulk billed.  

09:24 – note finished, running late for next pt.
