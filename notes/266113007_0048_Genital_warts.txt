CC: HA + “little bumps down there”  

HPC  
HA x ~3/52 intermittent dull band-like F + temples ± occiput  
Worse later in day after long bar shifts / screens “staring at the EFTPOS all night”  
3–4/10, to 6/10 on bad days  
No thunderclap, no “worst ever”  
No vomiting, rare mild nausea  
No photophobia/phonophobia, no aura, no visual ∆, no focal neuro sx, no speech ∆, no confusion  
Sleep helps, Panadol 500 mg 1–2 tabs PRN partial relief  
No fever, neck stiff, wt loss, night sweats, sinus Sx, trauma  

Also vulval “little bumps” x 2–3/12  
Thinks from shaving, reluctant to attend “don’t really like coming in for that stuff”  
Mild itch/irritation after sex/wiping, no sig pain, no bleeding, no discharge, no systemic Sx  
1 male partner x ~8/12, condoms “mostly not”  
No prev STI screen x “few years”

PMHx: nil sig, no migraines, no seizures, no clotting d/o  
Meds: PRN Panadol only, no OCP  
Allergies: NKDA  
SHx: bar work, late shifts, ↑ caffeine, ETOH socially  

Ex  
Obs WNL (BP 112/70 HR 78 afeb)  
Neuro: non-focal, CN intact, gait/coord normal, no meningism, fundoscopy NAD (no papilloedema)  
Pelvic (chaperone): multiple 2–4 mm soft skin-coloured/verrucous papules ~6–8 on labia minora + post introitus, non-tender, no ulcer/vesicles, no discharge. Vagina/cx normal. No ing LN.  

Impression  
1) Tension-type HA → likely stress / posture / sleep / screen related. No red flags, exam reassuring.  
2) Genital warts ext vulva – c/w HPV 6/11  
3) At-risk sexual behaviour – inconsistent condom use, no recent STI screen, HPV vacc ?incomplete  

Plan  
HA  
- Reassured re benign features  
- Non-pharm: sleep hygiene, ↓ caffeine/ETOH, posture, hydration (briefly discussed)  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day), avoid >15 d/mth  
- Red flags explained – sudden severe HA, neuro sx, fever/neck stiff → ED / urgent review  

Genital warts  
- Dx + natural hx discussed; low-risk HPV  
- Pt prefers home tx, avoid painful procedures  
- Rx imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara)  
  • Thin layer to visible warts 3x/week nocte (e.g. M/W/F)  
  • Wash off 6–10 hrs later  
  • Up to 16/52 or until clearance  
  • If marked irritation → ↓ freq or pause  
- Avoid sex while cream on / very inflamed; condoms advised though not fully protective  
- Partner: no tx if asymptomatic; consider HPV vacc (discussed)  

STI / prev care  
- STI screen ordered today: HIV Ag/Ab, syphilis serol, CT/NG NAAT (FPU)  
- Hep B/C serol next longer appt (time)  
- Urine HCG offered (LMP ~2/52 ago, no missed period) – pt declined today, aware needed pre certain tx / if late  
- Cervical screening + HPV vacc status review + contraception → book longer appt when able  

F/U  
- Review 2–3/52: HA, STI results, response to imiquimod (consider cryo if poor response / intolerant)  
- RTC earlier if HA pattern ∆, neuro sx, systemic sx or rapid ∆ in vulval lesions (pain/bleeding etc)
