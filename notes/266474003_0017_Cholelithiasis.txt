6/12 hx intermittent RUQ/epigastric pain, colicky “like a bad stitch”, sometimes to R shoulder, up to 7/10, 30–60min usually, 2–3h x2. Mostly evenings, post fatty meals (KFC, hot chips etc). ~3–4 eps/month. One nocturnal episode last wk, settled with ibuprofen at home.

Today: asymptomatic, specifically denies current pain, fever, rigors, SOB, CP, vomiting. No wt loss, no night sweats.  
Pt queries “maybe it’s the Coke Zero” and “dodgy mattress” – reassured not primary issue.

PMHx: cholelithiasis. Otherwise denies chronic dz.  
Meds: none regular. PRN ibuprofen 200–400mg ~q1–2/52.

Obs: BP 126/78 HR 78 RR 14 SpO2 99% RA T 36.8 BMI ~28  
Abdo soft, non-distended, mild deep RUQ tend, no guarding/rebound, -Murphy, no masses

Ix  
Reviewed pt phone image of prior RUQ U/S → multiple GS, largest 9mm, GB wall normal, no pericholecystic fluid, CBD 5mm, no IHDD  
No recent bloods on file  

Dx  
1) Symptomatic cholelithiasis → recurrent biliary colic. Currently well, no e/o acute cholecystitis/cholangitis/pancreatitis  
2) Non-adherence / poor follow-up → risk of not attending surg review / missing red flags  

Plan  
– Explained gallstones + biliary colic, risks if no surgery (acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis)  
– Clear ED red flags discussed: severe constant RUQ/epigastric pain >1–2h esp with fever, vomiting, jaundice, or feeling very unwell → ED ASAP, not GP. Also severe epigastric pain → back + vomiting (±pancreatitis)  
– Analgesia for future attacks only:  
  • Naproxen 500mg PO at onset then 250–500mg 12-hourly PRN short course (≤1/52). Take with food. Avoid if ulcer/renal issues (denied).  
  • Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/d). Can use with NSAID.  
  • Avoid codeine – no script for opioids today (if severe → hospital)  

– Diet: advised ↓fat, ↓fried/takeaway. Said Coke Zero/mattress not main factor.  

– Surg: advised elective lap chole recommended given recurrent biliary colic.  
  • Public hospital gen surg referral done (Sydney metro) – included hx + U/S summary from phone.  
  • Pt to sign release at reception so we can request formal U/S report from radiology.  
  • Discussed usual risks (bleed, infection, bile duct injury, conversion to open, anaesthetic risk), likely 1–2/52 off work. Reassured can provide med cert.  

– Bloods ordered today (bulk billed, asked her to go straight after appt to improve chance she actually does it):  
  • FBC, U&E, LFTs, lipase, CRP – baseline, check for occult inflam / liver / pancreatic involvement given hx. Results to be reviewed next visit.  

– Aware pt tends to “see how I go” and miss appts. Asked her to put reminder in phone to chase surg clinic if no contact in 1/52 (did so in room). Encouraged to get partner to remind.  

– Briefly mentioned “tired all the time” and diet/weight – defer to longer appt once gallbladder sorted.  

F/up  
– Review 1–2/52 with GP: check bloods, pain pattern, confirm contact from surg clinic.  
– RTC earlier if ↑freq/↑severity of biliary colic or unsure re red flags.  
– ED as above if severe persistent pain >2h, fever/rigors, vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, or severe epigastric pain → back + vomiting.
