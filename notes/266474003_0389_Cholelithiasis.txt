   - USS-confirmed gallstones, typical post-fatty meal RUQ pain, now well, obs/exam and LFT/lipase all reassuring.  
   - No e/o acute cholecystitis, cholangitis or pancreatitis today.  

2) Multiple other non-urgent issues (L shoulder ache, HAs, ?onychomycosis, tiredness/vitamins, skin spot, prev Pap etc) – deferred due to time, req long appt.  

P:  

1) Symptomatic gallstones / biliary colic  
- Explained dx and likley cause of attacks.  
- Red flags discussed: sev persisting RUQ/epig pain >4–6 hrs, fever/rigors, jaundice, dark urine, pale stool, repeated vom / unable to keep fluids → attend ED/000.  
- Analgesia plan for future eps:  
  - NSAID first line if no CI:  
    * Ibuprofn 400–600mg PO q6–8h PRN (max 2400mg/day) with food  
    OR  
    * Naproxen 500mg stat then 250mg q6–8h PRN (max 1250mg/day)  
  - Paracetamol 1g q6h PRN (max 4g/day) in combo OK.  
  - Avoid self-managing sev recurrent pain w codeine; seek review if needing stronger meds.  
- Surg mgmt: disc elective lap chole as definitive tx for recurrent biliary colic, incl brief outline of procedre, usual 1–2 wks off work for office job, and main risks (bleed, infectn, bile duct inj, convrsn to open, GA risk). Pt keen “to get it sorted” but needs to plan work leave.  
- Referral:  
  → Gen surg (local) for elective lap chole – referral sent today, disc public vs private; has basic private cover.  
- No further bloods today as asymp + recent labs N; to be repeated pre-op or earlier if clin picture changes.  
- Diet: advised to minimse very fatty/greasy meals until surg; avoid crash dieting.  

2) Other issues (“shopping list”)  
- Documented briefly; advised to book long (30 min) appt in next 2–3 wks to go thru systematically.  
- Pt to bring written list; will prioritise by impact / red flags.  

Safety net:  
RTC if pain more freq, longer, or with even modest fat; ED if red flags as above.  
FU GP 4–6 wks or after surg review, whichever earlier.  

Billing:  
Std consult, bulk billed.
