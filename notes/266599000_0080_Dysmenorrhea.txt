Assessment  
1 Dysmenorrhoea 2° known endometriosis symptom flare post COCP cessation signif impact work QOL nil features to suggest malignancy acute PID other secondary cause currently  
2 Endometriosis known prev responsive to hormonal suppression no recent specialist r/v  
3 Family planning wants pregnancy in 1–2 yrs but not yet needs contraception aligned with pain control  

Plan  

1) Pain & cycle mgmt  
Discussed pathophys prostaglandins recurrence of pain off hormones expected with endo  
Change NSAID regimen  
– Start mefenamic acid 500mg PO tds commencing 24–48h pre expected menses continue first 2–3/7 of bleed or until pain settles  
– May use paracetamol 1g q6h prn between doses max 4g/24h  
– Avoid other NSAIDs concurrently take with food discussed GI risk young low risk nil PPI for now review if dyspepsia etc  
Non pharm continue heat light–mod exercise as tolerated basic stress sleep advice given  

2) Hormonal mgmt / contraception  
Options discussed COCP incl continuous POP LNG IUD implant depot  
Given prior good response to Levlen wants pregnancy in 1–2 yrs prefers non invasive option now  
– Restart COCP levonorgestrel/ethinyloestradiol eg Levlen ED PBS script provided  
– Regimen continuous extended cycle take active pills continuously for 3/12 then 4–7/7 break if troublesome breakthrough bleed  
– Covered benefits pain control cycle suppression contraception and risks VTE small ↑BP BTB mood change  
Non smoker nil migraine with aura nil VTE hx BMI normal suitable  
Adv backup contraception first 7/7  
LNG IUD discussed as longer term “set and forget” esp if pain persists pt interested but will see how she goes back on pill first  

3) Fertility / endometriosis f/u  
Explained endo can affect fertility but many conceive spontaneously esp age 29 mild–mod disease  
If trying for pregnancy and not pregnant after 6–12/12 → early gynae r/v  
Plan re-referral to gynae if inadequate improvement after 3/12 optimised NSAID + COCP or new red flag sx or when actively planning pregnancy for preconception + endo review  

4) Safety net  
Advised urgent r/v or ED if  
– Sudden severe pelvic pain  
– Fever vomiting syncope pain not cyclical  
– New heavy bleeding clots flooding IMB PCB abn PV discharge  
– Marked mood change or any SI  
Generic safety net also given pt advised to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion or if generally deteriorating  

5) Other issues  
Dietary approaches supplements pelvic floor physio briefly mentioned suggested longer appt if keen  
Routine preventative health immunisations skin check etc deferred  

Follow up  
R/V 3/12 to assess response to mefenamic acid + continuous COCP impact on work consider TVUS and/or gynae ref if suboptimal  
Earlier R/V PRN if red flags or SE from COCP NSAIDs  

Billing  
Standard consult item 23 private billing gap $45 pt paid on day Medicare rebated via Tyro PBS scripts issued for Levlen ED and mefenamic acid
