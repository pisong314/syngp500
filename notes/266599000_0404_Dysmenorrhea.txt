No pain no blister no weep no pus  
No fevers, URTI, jt pains, oral/eye sx  
New strong lavender washing powder + new moisturiser. Possible school cleaners  
Tried OTC hydrocortisone 1% bd x2/7 → partial help  
Took 1x cephalexin (friend’s) yest “to get on top of it”  

PMHx  
Adenomyosis / secondary dysmenorrhoea  
Prev iron def (heavy menses)  

Meds  
Mefenamic acid 500mg tds PRN first 2–3d menses  
Ibuprofen 200–400mg tds PRN (often with mefenamic)  
Paracetamol PRN  
NKDA  

O/E  
Obs WNL afebrile  
Skin: wrists/distal FA – multiple ill-defined erythematous patches/thin plaques 1–3cm, some excoriations, no vesicles/pustules/crusting, no warmth/tender/swelling → no cellulitis  
Ant neck few faint erythematous macules  
No mucosal/palms/soles/genital involvement. No target lesions  

A  
1) Likely allergic/irritant contact dermatitis (new detergent/moisturiser vs cleaners) – mild localised, non-infected. Abx NOT indicated  
2) Adenomyosis with secondary dysmenorrhoea – partially controlled, ↑NSAID use, no red flags (no IMB/PCB, no new pattern)  

P  
1) Rash  
- Stop new washing powder + moisturiser. Use sensitive/soap-free + bland emollient (e.g. Dermeze/Cetaphil)  
- Rx: mometasone furoate 0.1% cream OD up to 7/7 then PRN small amt  
- Rx: cetirizine 10mg PO mane PRN itch (OTC)  
- Explained low risk infection, why no abx; pt unhappy but accepts trial  
- RTC if spreading, pain, warmth, pus, blisters, fever, mucosal/eye involvement or no better 7–10/7 → then consider derm / patch testing  

2) Dysmenorrhoea / adenomyosis  
- Brief only today – time  
- Adv: use mefenamic as main NSAID, avoid dual NSAIDs (ibuprofen) – can add paracetamol instead  
- Plan discuss PPI cover (e.g. esomeprazole 20mg daily during menses) + hormonal options (COCP / Mirena / other LARC) at longer appt  
- No imaging today – known adenomyosis, pattern stable  
- Will order FBC, iron studies next review (S&N) given hx iron def + heavy bleed  

Tests today: none (rash clinically clear)  

Work: given cert for today only – explained can’t pre-empt next week  

F/U  
- Review rash 1–2/52 or earlier if worse  
- Book long appt 4–6/52 for adenomyosis: pain control, NSAID/PPI, contraception/fertility, bloods (FBC, ferritin/iron ± TFT), consider rpt pelvic US if sx change  

Pt initially pushing for abx + urgent derm referral “my usual doctor always does” but after explanation agrees to trial topical steroid + avoidance. Aware RTC if deteriorates.
