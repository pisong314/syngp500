RACF GP r/v – routine  

Reason for visit  
Request flu vax and COVID booster  
Ongoing SOB on exertion  

HPI  
72 yr old female Anglo-Australian retired admin lives perm in RACF Brisbane seen in room  
Known to staff as quite health anxious freq GP r/v for minor issues  

Today asking for “this years flu and COVID jabs” very worried re pneumonia “you see on the news”  
C/O being “more puffed walking to the dining room” over last few mths  no clear acute change last few days  
SOB mainly on exertion eg ~30–40m along corridor settles within few mins rest  nil SOB at rest  
Nil chest pain nil palps nil cough nil fevers nil calf pain or swelling nil pleuritic pain nil haemoptysis  
Sleeps on 2 pillows “just in case”  nil PND  eating drinking ok  

Very anxious re serious dx “I’ve been googling my shortness of breath I’m worried it could be cancer or a blood clot in my lungs”  
Asking “Are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests like a CT scan or something”  
Has been asking nurses to check sats most days  staff report 95–97% RA  

Other thoughts  
?aircon in corridor “making my lungs weaker”  
?vaccines could “make breathing worse”  

Reassured can still assess breathing today and proceed with vax if safe  

Background  
Nil known COPD asthma CCF IHD PE lung ca or anaemia in RACF file  
Never smoker per admission notes  pt confirms never smoked  
Meds per chart only PRN paracetamol and multivitamin  
NKDA  

Psychosocial  
Ambulant with 4WW  nil known cog impairment  conversation coherant oriented  
Staff report frequent reassurance seeking  
Daughter is EPOA lives local  not present today  staff say daughter also a bit worried re pt “overthinking everything”  

Obs (nursing pre GP)  
BP 138/76  
HR 78 reg  
RR 18  
Temp 36.6  
SpO₂ 96% RA  

Exam  
Gen  Sitting in armchair mildly anxious  talking in full sentences  nil use of accessory muscles  looks comfortable at rest  
Resp  Chest expansion sym  clear vesicular BS nil wheeze nil crackles nil rubs  percussion resonant  
CVS  HS dual nil murmur  nil oedema  JVP not ↑  
Abdo soft NT  
Calves soft NT nil swelling erythema asymmetry  
Neuro grossly non focal  
MSE anxious affect focussed on “missing something serious” repeatedly asking for reassurance  

Impression  
1  Mild stable exertional SOB  chronic over several mths  sats and exam reassuring  nil red flags for acute PE pneumonia ACS CCF etc  likely multifactorial deconditioning in RACF + health anxiety amplifying SOB sensation  needs further w/u but not urgent today  
2  Health anxiety / excessive health related worry longstanding pattern reinforced by internet searching and freq monitoring  
3  Immunisation  due for annual flu + COVID booster  nil contraindications today  

Plan  

# SOB / breathlessness  
Explained lungs clear heart sounds normal sats reassuring  discussed that breathlessness ≠ always low O₂  anxiety can ↑ perception SOB  
Reassured no indication emergent hospital transfer or urgent CT chest/CTPA today based on current picture  
Addressed specific fears “Based on today this does not look like cancer or a clot in the lung”  
Safety net to pt and staff  
- call ambulance if sudden marked ↑ SOB at rest new chest pain collapse coughing blood or SpO₂ pers <92% RA or new confusion fever productive cough  

Non pharm  
- Pacing graded activity in facility short walks rather than long bursts to reduce deconditioning  
- Positioning upright  slight forward lean on table/4WW if breathless  
- Simple breathing control eg pursed lip breathing briefly shown  written info to be left with nursing staff to reinforce  
- Keep room cool small fan to face if SOB  RACF to assist  

Ix (non urgent via RACF / mobile services)  
- FBC  
- U&E LFT TFT  
- BNP  
- ECG  
Consider CXR (mobile) if symptoms worsen or if abn bloods/ECG at next r/v  

Discussed pt request for “every possible test” explained stepwise approach  need to balance benefit vs unnecessary radiation transfers etc given low suspicion serious pathology today  pt accepted plan though still abit anxious  offered longer r/v specifically for breathlessness once results back  

Asked NUM to monitor over next 2–4/52 for any ↓ mobility or ↓ exertional tolerance or new resp sx  

# Health anxiety  
Validated worries gently challenged catastrophic thinking  
Encouraged limit googling stick to govt Heart Foundation Lung Foundation sites  will print links next visit  
Plan to create simple written breathlessness action plan at f/u  pt agreeable  
?psych input via telehealth if ongoing distress logistics to be explored at later date  

# Immunisation  
Discussed vax safety in setting of mild stable SOB  pt consented  
Given today  
- 2025 seasonal influenza vax IM L deltoid  
- COVID-19 mRNA booster age appropriate formulation IM R deltoid  
Observed briefly post vax  nil immediate reaction noted  
Nursing staff to monitor 20 mins post and document  

Issues deferred (time)  
- More detailed mood sleep broader anxiety management  
- ACP / goals of care re future serious illness breathlessness ideally with daughter/EPOA present  

F/U  
R/V next routine RACF round in ~2–4/52 to  
- check bloods and ECG  
- reassess SOB functional status  
- finalise breathlessness action plan  
- further address health anxiety consider referrals  

Earlier r/v / hospital transfer as per safety net above or if staff concerned pt “not her usual self”  

[Addendum 24/11 16:10 Dr K]  
Path forms completed left with RACF for collection this week  staff reminded to call if any acute change in SOB prior to planned r/v
