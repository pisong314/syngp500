22/11/25 – walk-in BB clinic GC  

72F new pt – SOB / wants “my proper puffers + the white pill”  

Hx  
SOB yrs, ↑ last 6–12/12  
Now SOB ~50–100m / stairs, no SOB at rest now  
Intermittent “tight chest” with SOB, settles w rest + blue puffer  
No cough, sputum, fever, CP, haemoptysis, leg swell, calf pain  
Known pericardial effusion dx ~1 yr ago in Syd “fluid round my heart” – no f/up >6/12, self-stopped “water tablet”  
Smoker ex, heavy (20–30 pack yrs) quit ~10 yrs  
Says “I’ve got chronic lung problems” – ?COPD/?asthma – no records  
Very fixated on scripts, ↓ insight, argues re need for tests – “you doctors never listen, just give me my scripts”  

Meds (pt recall – unreliable)  
“Blue puffer” – likely salbutamol PRN  
“White pill when chest really tight” – ?diuretic vs steroid vs other – unclear  
NKDA (pt report)  

O/E  
BP 132/76 HR 88 reg RR 18 SpO₂ 94% RA T 36.6  
Looks OK, talking full sentences, mildly winded after walk from WR → settles quickly  
Chest: vesicular BS, ↓ bases, scattered end-exp wheeze on forced exp, no focal crackles  
CVS: HS dual, no murmur heard, no ↑JVP, no oedema  

Ix today  
ECG in rooms: NSR ~85, no acute ST/T changes, no elec alternans, no obvious ischaemia  
Offered CXR + bloods (FBC/U&E/LFT/CRP/BNP/TFT) – pt declined “not sitting around all day for tests”  

Impression  
1) Chronic exertional dyspnoea – likely multifactorial  
   – ?COPD given smoking hx ± deconditioning  
   – Currently stable, no red flags for ACS/PE/PNA/acute HF  
2) Known pericardial effusion – status unclear, no tamponade clinically  
3) Med mgmt issue – requesting repeats of unknown meds – unsafe  
4) Challenging consult / ↓ engagement with Ix, strong belief she just needs “strong blue inhaler + pills”  

Plan  
– Rx salbutamol MDI 100 mcg: 1–2 puffs PRN SOB/wheeze, up to 4-hourly, max 8 puffs/day. Spacer advised  
– Declined to script unknown “white pill” – explained unsafe w/o dx / records. Pt unhappy, states “you’re just being difficult”  
– Offered to contact usual GP/pharmacy in Syd to clarify meds – pt refused  
– Rec non-urgent echo + CXR + bloods to reassess pericardial effusion / HF / other causes SOB → pt declined today  
– Public cardiology referral done (Gold Coast) for review of pericardial effusion + chronic SOB – may book later if she chooses  
– No O₂ (SpO₂ 94% RA, no indication), no opioids/benzos  
– Advised ED if acute severe SOB, new/worse CP, syncope, haemoptysis, marked leg swelling etc  
– F/up here 1–2/52 or earlier if worse – re-discuss Ix if more agreeable, review inhaler use  
– Asked to bring all meds/old letters next visit  
Pt left somewhat dissatisfied re not getting “all my scripts” but accepted salbutamol + ECG today.
