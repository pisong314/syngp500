58M truckie F/U lipids/BP – “just need my scripts, only got 10 mins”  

PMHx: HTN, dyslipid, obesity. No known DM/CKD. NKDA.  
Meds: Atorva 40 nocte, Perindopril 5 mane, PRN ibuprofen.  

HPC  
– Wants rpt scripts only  
– Known dyslipid x yrs on statin. Misses 1–2 doses/wk when on night runs  
– ↑fatigue on long runs, but no CP, SOB, palp, syncope, claud  
– HTN on perindo. No headaches, visual sx, neuro sx, oedema, SOB  
– Diet poor on road, wt ↑. Smoker ~10–15/d. ETOH 2–3 beers most nights  

O/E (focused)  
BP 148/92 R arm seated (no recent home readings)  
HR 82 reg, afeb, SpO2 98% RA  
Wt 112kg, Ht 178cm → BMI ~35  
CVS dual, no murmur, no oedema. Chest clear. Abd soft NT.  

Prev results (≈6/12 ago – copied from last review 03/05/23 15/08/24):  
TC 6.2, LDL 3.9, HDL 0.9, TG 2.4  
Fasting glu 5.9, eGFR >90, LFT/TSH N  

Impr  
– Dyslipidaemia – suboptimal control, high CV risk (58M, smoker, HTN, obesity, FHx IHD)  
– HTN – borderline ↑ today on perindopril 5  
– Obesity (BMI 35) – sedentary, diet related  
– Time-poor, limited engagement  

Plan  
Ix today (fasting if poss)  
– Fasting lipids  
– Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
– U&E, eGFR, LFT, TSH  
– Urine ACR  

Meds  
– Atorvastatin 40mg nocte – continue. PBS rpt x6 (generic atorva)  
  → reminded to keep pack in truck + phone alarm  
– Perindopril 5mg mane – continue for now  
  → will ↑ dose if BP still >140/90 after results / more readings  
– Avoid regular NSAIDs (BP/renal)  

BP monitoring  
– Asked to get BP checked x2 at local chemist / nurse over next 2–3/52 and bring/readings for next appt  

Lifestyle (very brief – pt rushing)  
– Strongly advised smoking cessation – pt “not ready now” → revisit later  
– Quick advice: cut sugary drinks/energy drinks, choose grilled>fried when can, small walks at rest stops  
– ETOH ≤2 std drinks/d, some AF days mentioned  

CV risk  
– Explained likely high 5–10 yr CVD risk with current profile  
– Continue statin long term. No aspirin started – to reconsider after formal risk calc with new bloods  

Safety net  
– Red flag: 000/ED if CP, SOB, neuro sx, severe headache/visual change  
– RTC earlier if any concerns  

F/U  
– Nurse BP check 2–3/52 (booked loosely – pt to fit around runs)  
– GP review 3–4/52 (telehealth OK if labs done) to review bloods/BP, consider ↑perindopril and lipid intensification (e.g. ↑atorva / add ezetimibe)  
– Longer appt later for full CV prevention / wt / smoking if he’ll attend  

Scripts printed & eRx sent. Bulk billed.  

08:51 – pt left in a hurry, declined further discussion “gotta get back on the road”
