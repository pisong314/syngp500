Reason for visit  
"cholesterol check" gen consult + rpt scripts  

S  
72yo Anglo-Aust man retired electrician known HTN CKD3a mixed dyslipidaemia  
Here for chol r/v "I want the strong stuff this time" "my old doctor just put me on the highest dose"  
Also wants "full body scan" of arteries does not want to wait if "something's wrong"  

CVS sx nil chest pain SOB PND orthopnoea palps claudication neuro sx nil  
Nil myalgia wkness RUQ pain jaundice itch on current statin  

Meds per record  
- Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
- Perindopril/indapamide 5/1.25mg mane  
- Amlodipine 5mg mane  
- Aspirin 100mg mane long term started by cards yrs ago  

Adherence "pretty good" forgets eve tabs 1–2x/wk  
Diet cut back red meat still takeaway 2–3x/wk "cheaper than cooking for one"  
Etoh 2–3 beers most nights believes this "thins the blood so it should help the cholesterol"  
Ex short walks 2–3x/wk avoids hills "get puffed and my knees"  
Ex smoker 30 pack yr quit 15yrs ago  

Pt theory re chol ↑ since council water change wants advice tap vs bottled  
Thinks "new blood pressure pills might be messing with the cholesterol"  

Wife present briefly says he gets "a bit impatient with doctors lately" but takes meds if she lays them out  

PMHx  
- Mixed dyslipidaemia  
- HTN  
- CKD3a eGFR usually ~48–52 ACR mildly ↑  
- Nil known DM last HbA1c 5.9% ~12/12 ago  
- Nil hx thyroid liver dz nephrotic syn  

Allergies NKDA  

FHx father MI 62 mother CVA 70s  

Behaviour quite directive keeps steering back to request for high dose statin + CT "Why cant you just put me on the highest dose statin and book the CT scan today" some comparison to prev GP needs firm boundaries remains cooperative

10yr CVD risk high age >70 + male + HTN + CKD + dyslipid  

A  
1 Mixed dyslipidaemia in high absolute CVD risk pt LDL still above target HDL low TG mildly ↑ on mod dose atorva lifestyle suboptimal  
2 HTN controlled on current regimen  
3 CKD3a stable  
4 Long term aspirin for presumed primary prev ?ongoing benefit vs bleed risk in 70s  
5 Pt expectations demanding wants "full body scan" and max statin needs ongoing education + boundary setting  

P  
# Lipids / CVD risk  
Discussed focus on overall heart stroke risk vs just chol number or "full body scans"  
Explained ↑ statin dose evidence based in his risk group scans not routinely indicated Medicare will not cover whole body CT for screening  
Med change  
- Atorvastatin 20→40mg nocte (renal + LFT ok)  
Advised re poss SE myalgia wkness dark urine to seek r/v if occurs  

Lifestyle briefly  
- Diet discussed less takeaway more veg whole grains fish ↓ processed meats  
- Etoh advised ↓ to 1–2 std drinks on non consecutive nights explained alcohol does not "thin blood in a good way" can ↑ TG BP  

Ix  
- Repeat fasting lipids U&E eGFR LFTs ordered for 3/12  
- HbA1c to be added with next bloods (pt keen to leave today so deferred form filling detail)  

Education  
Reassured no evidence council water change affects chol  
BP meds unlikely main driver of chol benefits for HTN + kidneys outweigh any small lipid effect  

Imaging  
Pt requested "full body scan" / "scan of arteries"  
Explained no indication for whole body CT potential harm from radiation incidental findings etc  
Discussed that in high risk pts we tx on risk rather than CAC score etc CAC may not change mgmt as already need max med therapy  
Pt a bit unhappy "I dont see why you cant just order it" but accepted plan once explained re guidelines + Medicare  

# HTN  
BP at target for CKD  
Continue  
- Perindopril/indapamide 5/1.25mg mane  
- Amlodipine 5mg mane  
Encouraged adherence pillbox / phone reminders  

# CKD3a  
Stable on ACEi  
Repeat U&E eGFR with bloods in 3/12  
Advised avoid NSAIDs maintain hydration more detailed CKD ed and care plan next longer appt with PN in 6–8/52  

# Aspirin  
Flagged need to r/v primary prev aspirin in >70 with CKD bleeding risk vs benefit  
Not fully addressed today due to time and pt focus on chol will revisit next longer appt before making change  

Scripts today  
- Atorvastatin 40mg nocte rpt  
- Perindopril/indapamide 5/1.25mg mane rpt  
- Amlodipine 5mg mane rpt  

F/U  
- r/v 3/12 with fasting bloods 1 wk prior to assess lipids renal fn overall CVD mgmt  
- Longer chronic dz r/v 20–30min HTN CKD meds incl aspirin lifestyle ideally within 6–8/52 (front desk to arrange he asked "not too far out")  

Safety net  
Advise R/V earlier if new chest pain SOB palps neuro sx severe abdo pain or if feels acutely crook  
Also if signif myalgia wkness or dark urine on ↑ statin  

Time  
Std 15min consult multiple issues imaging request took extra discussion some chronic dz topics deferred to next r/v
