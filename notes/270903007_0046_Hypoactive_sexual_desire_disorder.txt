2 Routine health check 38yo F opportunity for preventive care baseline bloods  

Plan  
HSDD / sexual health  
- Education re normal variation in desire effect of stress fatigue relationship dynamics body image on libido reassured not her fault  
- Explained recognised condition HSDD help available validated distress even though she feels she is "making a fuss"  
- Discussed limited role for meds eg testosterone flibanserin in premenopausal women in Aus primary care focus initially on psychosocial + modifiable factors  
- Encouraged open non blaming discussion with partner re how shes feeling  
- Offered psych / sex therapist ref (regional centre or telehealth) pt hesitant re time cost will think about telehealth option info given re reputable Aust sexual health/psych services  
- Mentioned mindfulness / CBT based approaches for sexual function suggested some online resources to look at prior to next r/v  

Medical workup  
- As above fasting bloods incl TSH iron etc  
- Discussed testosterone levels not useful to determine therapy in women and testosterone not routinely used in premenopausal women due to limited data + potential risks  

Lifestyle / general  
- Brief chat re wt management ↑PA target ~150min mod intensity/wk sleep hygiene framed as for overall wellbeing energy libido
