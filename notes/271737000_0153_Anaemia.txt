22/11/25 14:05 – TH video (pt home, regional Newcastle)

42F Indian-Aust, part-time pharmacist

CC: ↓ appetite “just not wanting to eat much” x3–4/52

HPC  
Progressive anorexia, early satiety “get full really quick even with one chapati”  
No N/V, no abdo pain, no dysphagia, no GORD sx  
No change taste/smell  
↑ fatigue same period – “by the arvo at work I’m wiped out”  
Mild DOE stairs, no CP, no palps, no syncope  
Intermittent postural light-headedness  
No obvious blood loss – denies PR bleed/melaena/haematemesis/haematuria/epistaxis/easy bruising  
Menses regular, not heavier currently (one heavy period 2–3/12 ago)  
No fevers, NS, or known wt loss (clothes same)  

Background  
IBD (likely UC) dx ~8y, on mesalazine, last flare ~1y ago, says quiescent  
Prev IDA 3y ago – needed IV iron then, oral iron poorly tolerated (GI upset, bowel sx worse)  
No known B12/folate issues  
Meds: mesalazine (dose ?), PRN paracetamol, vit D “on and off”  
No NSAIDs / anticoag / antiplatelet  
NKDA  
Non-smoker, rare EtOH  

MHx  
Mood a bit flat 2° tired, still enjoys family, denies anhedonia, anxiety, SI  

Telehealth exam (limited)  
Looks tired but well, alert, oriented, talking in full sentences  
?mild pallor on screen, hard to tell  
RR appears normal, no audible wheeze/cough  
Walked to get water – gait steady, no obvious SOB  
No red flag neuro on conversation

Red flags screened – nil CP, no severe SOB, no blackouts, no focal neuro, no PND/orthopnoea

Imp  
1) Anorexia / early satiety 3–4/52 – likely 2° anaemia vs IBD activity vs other (endocrine, malignancy less likely from hx but not excluded)  
2) ?Recurrent anaemia – suspect IDA given IBD hx + vegetarian diet + sx (fatigue, DOE, ?pallor) → need to confirm type (iron vs B12/folate vs ACD)  
3) IBD – pt reports clinically quiet, but still risk for recurrent IDA / malabsorption

Plan  
– Discussed likely anaemia contributing to ↓ appetite + fatigue  
– Given prior poor tolerance oral iron + IBD, if IDA confirmed → likely IV iron again rather than PO  
– Explained transfusion only if severe / very symptomatic, will depend on Hb + sx

Ix today (e‑request to local path)  
– FBC  
– Iron studies (iron, ferritin, transferrin, TSat)  
– B12, folate  
– U&E, LFT  
– CRP, ESR  
– TSH  
– Coeliac serology (screen once-off re anaemia / malabsorption)

If anaemia and/or ↑ inflammatory markers →  
– Consider faecal calprotectin  
– GI review (usual gastro at tertiary centre)  
– +/- FOBT / stool occult blood depending on results + any new GI sx

Interim  
– Small frequent meals suggested, ↑ veg iron sources within vegetarian diet  
– Avoid self‑starting oral iron – advised against due to prior intolerance + IBD, pt agrees  
– Pt worried re IV iron side effects – reassured, discussed transient flu-like sx, rare allergy; she recalls tolerating ok last time  
– Symptom diary (energy, appetite, SOB, bowels, menses) until review

Safety net  
– ED / urgent review if marked SOB at rest, CP, palps, presyncope/syncope  
– Any obvious bleeding (black stools, BRBPR, haematemesis, heavy prolonged periods, haematuria, unusual bruising)  
– Rapid wt loss, persistent fevers, drenching NS, sudden major drop in function

F/U  
– Pt to do bloods next 1–2/7  
– TH f/up 1/52 to review results + plan (IV iron vs other)  
– Longer review later for broader chronic dz / prevention once current issue sorted

[Added 16:30 25/11/25 by Dr K. Lee – no results yet in system, pt called asking if she should “just grab some Ferro‑Grad from work” – reiterated note above: wait for bloods, avoid OTC iron for now given IBD hx. RTC earlier if feeling significantly more crook or SOB. F/up appt still booked for next week. Reviewed and co‑signed by Dr Thompson]
