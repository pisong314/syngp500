32F review stool result  

Hx: recent gastro – "really crook gut" last 1–2/52. Watery D+V, fevers/chills x1–2d, abdo cramps. No blood PR recalled. No recent abx, no travel. LMP ~3/52 ago, cycles regular, no preg concern. Works hospitality (food handling). Several staff unwell similar.  

Today: V settled (last few days ago). D ↓ now ~3–4 loose/day, no nocturnal, mild crampy central/lower abdo pain → better after stool. Feels tired but drinking ok, passing urine normal. No SOB, CP, sig dizziness.  

Red flags -ve: no severe/constant abdo pain, no guarding, no PR blood/melaena, no haematemesis, no bilious V, no recent hospital, no IBD hx.  

Meds: no regular. Took short course OTC anti-diarrhoeal (likely loperamide) early on only. NKDA.  

O/E: afeb 36.8 BP 112/70 HR 84 RR 16 SpO₂ 99% RA. Looks tired but not toxic. Hydration clinically adequate. Abd soft, mild diffuse peri-umb + lower tenderness, no guarding/rebound, BS+. No CVA tenderness.  

Ix: stool PCR (SNP/QML) from last visit: Campylobacter jejuni detected. No Salmonella/Shigella/STEC/C.diff/viral. FBC/U&E/CRP ordered prev but not done. Given improving and obs stable, defer bloods today – consider FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP + rpt stool if not settling >5–7d or any deterioration.  

Dx:  
1) Campylobacter gastroenteritis – improving  
2) Food handler – public health / work exclusion issue  

Plan:  
- Explained Campy result, likely foodborne, self-limiting, currently improving → no abx indicated (young, otherwise well, no red flags).  
- Fluids PO, light diet as tolerated. Avoid further loperamide. Simple analgesia PRN (paracetamol only – avoid NSAIDs if ↓ intake).  
- Work: advised exclude from food handling until ≥48h after last D. Med cert given for current illness + next 2d; extend PRN if still symptomatic. Emphasised hand hygiene, avoid food prep for others while D ongoing.  
- Safety-net: ED/urgent review if ↑ abdo pain, high fevers/rigors, PR blood/black stool, persistent V, ↓ urine/dizziness, neuro sx.  
- Pt also c/o feeling "run down" last few months – no time today, asked to book separate standard appt once recovered for further workup (fatigue, MH, bloods incl FBC, U&E, LFT, TFT, iron studies).  

F/up: review 5–7d if D not resolved or sooner if worse. If back to normal BM and well, RTC PRN.
