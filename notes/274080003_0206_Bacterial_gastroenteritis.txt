2 Recent travel Bali pt anxious re malaria dengue hep A/E – explained unlikely given afebrile GI predominant sx timing  

Plan  
Hydration  
– Encourage oral fluids ORS eg Hydralyte small freq sips  
Diet  
– Light low fat avoid spicy greasy alcohol caffeine for now may trial temp lactose avoidance if worse with dairy  

Meds  
– Avoid further loperamide for now given persisting infective diarrhoea discussed pharmacist advice vs current recs pt reluctantly agreed  
– No empiric abx at present will wait stool results or if clinical deterioration  

Work / infection control  
– As food handler advised off work until at least 24–48h after last loose stool  
– If notifiable pathogen on stool will need public health notification and may need clearance stool  

Safety net  
Advised r/v GP or ED urgently if  
– ↑ abdo pain esp localised rigid abdo  
– Blood or black stool  
– Fever >38.5 rigors confusion collapse  
– Marked ↓ urine or unable keep fluids down  
– New rash severe headache neck stiffness neuro sx  
Usual advice given re calling 000 if severe SOB chest pain confusion though resp sx nil today  

F/U  
R/v 3–4/7 or earlier if worse or nil improvement  
Clinic to call re abnormal bloods or positive stool  
If diarrhoea >2/52 will consider parasitic causes post infective IBS GI ref  

Pt also wants general travel vaccine plan full check up advised book longer 30min appt once acute issue settled
