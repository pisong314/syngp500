34F c/o “swelling” lower back x ~5–6/7. Hx L5/S1 spondylolisthesis (MRI ~3y ago). Very anxious re “spinal cancer” after Dr Google  

HPI  
- Noticed “puffy lump” midline low back just above buttocks in shower  
- No trauma/fall, usual lifting at childcare  
- Pain = baseline chronic mech LBP, maybe ↑ ache after work, no new radicular sx  
- No red flag sx: no wt loss, no fevers/night sweats, no night pain, no bladder/bowel sx, no saddle anaesthesia, no leg weakness/numbness  
- Using ibuprofen 400mg 1–2/d work days + occasional Panadol with partial relief  
- Hx recurrent AAU (last 18/12/23) + recent resolved conjunctivitis. No current eye pain/photophobia/vision change  
- Marked health anxiety, repeatedly asking for MRI/“full body scan”  

PMHx (relevant)  
- Mech spondylolisthesis L5/S1  
- Recurrent acute anterior uveitis  
- Health anxiety  

Meds  
- Ibuprofen 400mg PRN (most days)  
- Paracetamol 1g PRN  

SHx: works childcare, lots of lifting  

O/E  
Obs WNL (BP 112/70, afebrile)  
Back: no obvious lump/mass, mild soft tissue prominence only, symmetrical. Mild Lx paraspinal TTP R>L. No warmth/erythema. Mild ↓ROM at end range as per prior. No SIJ TTP  
Neuro LL: power 5/5, sensation intact, reflexes N, SLR -, gait N  
Eyes: no redness, no photophobia, EOMI, vision grossly N  

Impression  
1) “Swelling” lower back – appears normal paraspinal soft tissue on background mech LBP. No clinical mass. No red flags for malignancy/infection  
2) Mech LBP 2° L5/S1 spondylolisthesis – mild flare  
3) Hx AAU – currently quiescent  
4) Health anxiety contributing significantly  

Plan  
- Reassured re benign findings, no indication for urgent imaging. Discussed why MRI / “full body scan” not indicated currently → low yield + may ↑ anxiety  
- Analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/day)  
  - Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food (max 1200mg/d OTC)  
- No med changes today – advised limit regular NSAID use where possible given GI risk  
- Physio referral for core strength + manual handling / ergonomics (sent via EMR)  
- Red flag/safety net briefly: return/ED if new neuro deficit, bladder/bowel change, rapidly ↑ pain esp at night, systemic sx, or new discrete hard lump  
- AAU: reminded of eye red flags (pain, photophobia, ↓ vision, circumcorneal redness) → urgent ophthal/ED if recur. Pt still has ophthal contact  
- Health anxiety: suggested longer appt to focus on this, discuss MHCP/psych (CBT). Plan K10/GAD-7 next visit  

F/U  
- Review 2–3/52 re back sx + anxiety, earlier if any red flags  
- Pt also mentioned “stomach bloating” briefly – deferred, advised separate appt if ongoing
