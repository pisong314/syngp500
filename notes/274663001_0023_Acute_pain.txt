Reason for visit  
F/U L shoulder pain  

S  
34F admin officer local hospital Anglo-Australian  
Here for r/v L shoulder pain first seen 5/7 ago after lifting heavy archive boxes at work  

Last visit dx acute MSK strain started reg paracetamol + ibuprofen advised rest physio if not beter  

Today  
- Pain: says “no beter at all” still ~7/10 worst deep ache lat/post L shoulder worse OH movement reaching behind back sleep disturbed esp lying on L side  
  Nil radiation below elbow nil neck pain  
- Function: still working avoiding lifting “cant keep babying this shoulder” wants it “fixed properly today”  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1g tds most days ibuprofen 400mg bd “when I remember” nil opioids inconsistent ice/heat  
- Requests: very insistent on imaging + stronger meds  
  “My usual doctor in Melbourne would send me for an MRI straight away and give me something stronger”  
  Asking specifically for codeine “Why cant you just prescribe what I’m asking for I’m in pain”  
- Pt theories aircon draft at work cheaper pillow “might have stuffed my shoulder”  
- Red flags: nil trauma beyond initial lift nil fall nil dislocation nil systemic Sx nil fevers wt loss night sweats  
  Nil CP SOB abdo pain  
  Nil neuro Sx numbness tingling weakness loss of grip  
- WorkCover form lodged last visit employer can modify duties short term limited long term light duties  
  Pt keen avoid time off “I really don’t want a sick certificate I just want it fixed”

- Insp nil deformity swelling erythema wasting  
- Palp tender over lat deltoid insertion upper trap nil bony tend over clavicle ACJ humeral head nil warmth  
- ROM active abd to ~110° limited by pain FF to ~150° pain end range ER mildly limited by pain IR painful reaching behind back  
  Passive slightly > active pain only at end range nil hard block

A  
1 Acute L shoulder pain 2° likely RC tendinopathy / impingement pattern post lifting at work  
   Mod severity affecting some ADLs + sleep nil features of full thickness tear dislocation # septic arthritis or neuro compromise  
2 Expectation mgmt issue pt strongly requesting MRI + opioids esp codeine  

P  
1 Education / discussion  
   - Explained exam c/w soft tissue strain / impingement expected course over wks  
   - Discussed limited role of early imaging esp MRI in absence of red flags normal strength  
   - Explained opioids incl codeine not 1st line for this type mod acute MSK pain risks depn sedation constipation etc  
   Pt initially unhappy “I don’t see why I cant just get an MRI and proper painkillers” eventually agreed to trial optimised conservative plan after guideline based explanation  

2 Analgesia  
   - Paracetamol ↑ to reg dosing 1g q6h max 4g/24h for 5–7/7 then prn  
   - Change NSAID ibuprofen → naproxen for convenience  
     Naproxen 500mg stat then 250mg bd with food up to 5/7 avoid other NSAIDs advised take with food fluids stop earlier if pain much beter or any GI Sx  
   - Opioids avoided at this stage will only reconsider if severe uncontrolled pain despite optimised non opioid regime + recheck for red flags  

3 Non pharm  
   - Relative rest avoid OH lifting heavy pushing/pulling 1–2 wks keep gentle ROM within pain limits to avoid stiffness  
   - Ice or heat packs 15–20min up to qid as preferred  
   - Demonstrated pendulum + gentle active assisted ROM in room gave handout physio style sheet R/V 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 (old template text left in)  

4 Referrals / Ix  
   - Imaging nil ordered today MRI not indicated currently  
     Plan consider plain XR if persisting Sx >4–6/52 or earlier if new red flags  
   - Physio  
     Recommended early physio for targeted RC + scapular strengthening posture  
     Pt “I still want a specialist referral not just physio”  
     Explained stepwise approach start physio consider ortho if failure conservative mgmt or if later imaging shows signif structural lesion  
     Physio ref provided to local provider advised possible gap fees  

5 Work / admin  
   - Discussed mod duties limit heavy lifting OH work repetitive tasks on L side  
   - Offered WorkCover cert for mod duties pt declined sick leave “just wants it fixed”  
   - Advised if ↑pain or unable to perform current duties to RTC for reassessment and possible certificate  

6 Safety net  
   - Advised urgent r/v or ED if  
     • sudden marked ↑pain or new inability to raise arm / feeling shoulder giving way  
     • new numbness tingling weakness in arm/hand  
     • swelling redness warmth joint fevers feeling generally unwell  
     • CP SOB or other concerning Sx  

7 Other issues  
   - Pt briefly mentioned “getting really tired all the time” wants “full blood check up”  
     Explained time limited today focused on acute shoulder asked to book separate appt for fatigue workup incl routine bloods  

F/U  
R/V 10–14/7 to reassess pain + function consider imaging or ortho ref if nil improvement  
RTC earlier if worse or concerned
