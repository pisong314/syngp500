CALD limited English attends with adult daughter who interprets  
Pt: "my daughter help explain no understand sorry"  

HPI  
Acute L sided low back pain x ~10/7 onset after lifting heavy stock boxes @work  
Initial sharp twinge now constant dull ache baseline 4/10 with intermittent sharper pain 7–8/10 on flexion twisting rolling in bed  
Affects ability to complete full shifts needs to sit more avoids heavier lifting  
Nil prev signif back issues  

Analgesia so far  
Paracetamol 1 g up to TDS OTC partial relief last dose this am  
Had ibuprofen from chemist says that worked beter now finished chemist advised needs GP  
Requesting "stronger tablets" ie ?opioid opioid naïve  

Red flags  
Nil leg weakness numbness paraesthesia nil saddle anaesthesia  
Nil bowel or bladder incontinence or retention  
Nil trauma/fall fevers wt loss IVDU malignancy hx  
Pain localised L lumbar region no radiation below knee  

Pt theories re cause "cold air from shop door" "sleeping on wrong side" discussed likely mechanical strain 2° lifting rather than exposure  

PMHx  
Nil known renal disease PUD bleeding disorder asthma  
Not preg regular menses LMP ~2/52 condoms with partner  
Non smoker minimal EtOH  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1 g TDS PRN

Social  
Lives with husband 2 kids daughter assists with translation + meds  
Concerned re time off work wants to keep working light duties ok  

Communication  
Relies on daughter for interpretation tends to nod along not always clear she fully understands dosing warnings  
Declined TIS today "daughter ok" will consider if more complex issues in future  

Objective

BP 118/74 HR 78 RR 16 Temp 36.7°C SpO₂ 99% RA  

Gen  
Mobilises independently mildly uncomfortable esp when moving  

Back exam  
Inspection nil deformity bruising swelling  
Palpation localised TTP L paraspinal muscles approx L3–L5 ↑tone spasm  
Nil midline bony tenderness  
ROM flexion extension mildly ↓ 2° pain side flex to L reproduces pain  

Neuro LL  
Power 5/5 hips knees ankles bilat  
Reflexes patellar Achilles 2+ symm

Nil CVA tenderness abdo soft NT  

Assessment  
1 Acute mechanical L sided low back pain consistent with acute nociceptive musculoskeletal strain moderate severity  
   Exam and hx consistent with simple mechanical LBP as per national back pain guidelines  
   Nil clinical features for cauda equina cord compression radiculopathy infection malignancy or fracture so no immediate imaging indicated  
2 Medication request for stronger analgesia  
   Given simple mechanical pattern and guideline based approach non opioid multimodal regimen indicated opioids not recommended 1st line for uncomplicated acute LBP  
3 CALD limited English relying on family interpreter ↑risk of misundertanding re dosing adverse effects safety net  

Plan  

Analgesia  
As per eTG back pain guidance  
- Paracetamol 1 g PO QID PRN max 4 g/24h short term only  
- Start NSAID  
  Ibuprofen 400 mg PO TDS with food for up to 5/7 then PRN  
  Advised avoid other NSAIDs take with food cease and seek r/v if epigastric pain black stools haematemesis or ↓urine output  

Discussed rationale against opioids for this presentation limited additional benefit vs ↑risk dependence sedation constipation esp in uncomplicated mechanical LBP as per guidelines  
Pt initially asking "strong pain tablet" after discussion agrees to trial current regimen first  

Non pharmacological  
Relative rest avoid heavy lifting bending twisting next 1–2 wks  
Heat pack to lower back 15–20 min at a time  
Demonstrated simple stretches eg knee to chest pelvic tilt brief only printed handout with diagrams provided asked daughter to go through @home  
Encouraged light walking within pain limits may request temporary lighter duties @work  

Investigations  
Nil today clear mechanical trigger nil red flags expect improvement over coming days to 2/52  
Consider imaging and physio if persistent >4–6/52 or functional limitation significant  

Education safety net  
Red flag advice given via daughter then checked understanding using teach back  
Seek urgent GP/ED if  
- New leg weakness or severe shooting leg pain  
- Numbness inner thighs/groin  
- Difficulty passing urine urinary retention or new incontinence bowel or bladder  
- Fever feeling very unwell  
- Sudden marked ↑pain not responding to meds  

Written simple med plan provided large font  
"Panadol 1 gram up to 4 times per day"  
"Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times per day with food for 5 days" tick boxes added  

Other issues  
Pt briefly mentioned intermittent "head pain" no time to explore fully today asked to book separate appt if ongoing once back improved documented for f/u  

Scripts today  
- Paracetamol 500 mg tabs take 2 tabs (1 g) PO QID PRN pain qty 100 no rpt  
- Ibuprofen 200 mg tabs take 2 tabs (400 mg) PO TDS with food for up to 5/7 then PRN qty 50 no rpt  

Follow up  
R/v 5–7/7 if not improving earlier if worse or red flag sx  
If pain persisting beyond ~4–6/52 or work function still limited consider physio ref and imaging (lumbar XR/MRI as per guidelines not routine now)
