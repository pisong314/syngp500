Reason for visit  
- Script rpts CAD CVD COPD meds  
- Overdue chronic disease r/v polyvascular disease  

S  
74yo Anglo-Aust male retired construction worker  
Walk-in says "just need a script quick only got 10 mins" keen to limit disc checks watch often  

HPC  
# Polyvascular disease CAD CVD PVD  
- Hx NSTEMI 2018 PCI to LAD  
- Ischaemic CVA 2021 full functional recovery per pt  
- PVD with stable claudication  
- Today  
  - nil chest pain tightness jaw or arm pain  
  - nil SOB at rest nil orthopnoea nil PND nil ankle swelling  
  - calf discomfort after ~2 blocks walking both legs relieved by rest "same as always" no rest pain  
  - nil foot ulcers nil skin breakdown nil colour change noted  
- Function  
  - Indep ADLs light walking gardening  
- Adherence  
  - Takes meds "most days" sometimes skips nocte statin esp if "out late with the boys"  
  - nil home BP checks  
- RF  
  - Smoker 5–8 cig/d current long term hx prev up to 20/d says "cut down not ready to quit"  
  - Nil known DM  
  - Lipids HbA1c not done >12/12  

# Neurological  
- nil recent TIA sx nil unilateral weakness facial droop speech disturb visual loss acute imbalance  

# COPD  
- Known mod COPD (prior spirometry GOLD II)  
- Baseline DOE mild stable nil cough ↑sputum fever infective sx  
- Nil recent exacerbations or hosp last 12/12  
- Using LAMA/LABA daily SABA "once or twice a week" mainly exertional  
- Still smoking as above  

Other  
- Mentions sleeping in recliner as bed "no good for my back" denies nocturnal SOB sounds MSK will need separate appt if persisting  
- Lives with wife good supports financially ok drives own car  
- Main barrier to care time attitude "too busy for long doctor visits" despite retired  

PMHx (problem list – brief)  
- Polyvascular disease PVD + CAD + CVD

- Ischaemic stroke 2021  
- COPD mod  
- HTN  
- Hyperlipidaemia  
- OA knees (not addressed today)  

Meds (per EMR confirmed as best as poss)

A  
1 Polyvascular disease (CAD CVD PVD) clinically stable today nil features acute limb ischaemia or CLTI  
2 CAD post NSTEMI PCI stable sx but 2° prevention suboptimal due to partial non adherence ongoing tobacco use high residual CV risk as per Aust CVD guidelines  
3 CVD post ischaemic stroke stable nil new neuro sx 2° prevention overlap with CAD  
4 COPD mod GOLD II stable between exacerbations ongoing smoking main driver of progression as per GOLD criteria  
5 CV risk factors HTN reasonably controlled today probable dyslipidaemia not recently checked ongoing smoker overweight  

P  
Consult constrained by pt time pressure focus on safe rpt prescribing brief risk review defer full chronic disease r/v to longer appt  

Meds  
- Rpt scripts issued  
  - Aspirin 100mg mane x 6/12  
  - Atorvastatin 40mg nocte x 6/12 reinforced need daily use for plaque stabilisation ↓MI stroke risk  
  - Perindopril 5mg mane x 6/12  
  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg mane x 6/12 advised not to cease abruptly given CAD  
  - Tiotropium/olodaterol 2 puffs daily x 6/12  
  - Salbutamol inhaler PRN rpt  
- Explained briefly meds for long term 2° prevention not just sx control emphasised high absolute CVD risk age male polyvascular disease smoking  

Ix  
To be done via local path (e.g. SNP) before longer r/v  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BSL HbA1c  
- UEC eGFR  
- LFT  
- FBC  
Plan to recalc CVD risk using Aus CVD risk calculator once results back  

Lifestyle / RF (brief due to time)  
- Smoking  
  - Advised strongly complete cessation key modifiable RF for CAD CVD COPD progression  
  - Pt contemplative only "maybe next time"  
  - Offered NRT varenicline Quitline info pt declined today "no time" will revisit at chronic disease appt  
- Exercise  
  - Encouraged regular walking within claudication limits stop when pain starts rest then resume to promote collateral formation  
- Diet  
  - Advised takeaway and servo "vitamin drinks" will not "clean the arteries" encouraged more veg wholegrains ↓sat fat further disc with PN/dietitian at longer visit  

Safety net  
- Red flags explained seek urgent ED/000 if  
  - new/worse chest pain SOB  
  - sudden neuro sx weakness speech visual change  
  - sudden severe leg pain cold pale limb  
  - new foot ulcers esp non healing  
- Earlier GP r/v if claudication distance ↓ significantly rest pain or colour temp change feet  

F/U  
- Book longer chronic disease r/v 20–30min within next 4/52  
  - review bloods BP trend global CVD risk  
  - more detailed PVD assessment consider ABI if indicated  
  - full COPD review ?pulm rehab  
  - dedicated smoking cessation counselling  
- Involve PN for GPMP/TCA at that visit if criteria met  
- Pt reluctant re multiple appts but agreed tentatively "a longer one in a few weeks" msg left with reception to arrange before leaving  

Time  
Std 10–15 min consult multiple chronic issues identified but only partialy addressed today due to pt imposed time limit further work deferred
