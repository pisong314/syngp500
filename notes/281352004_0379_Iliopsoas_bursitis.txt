A  
R groin / ant hip pain 42F  
Most likely  
1  Iliopsoas bursitis / tendinopathy 2° overuse / occupational load  non septic  
   Supported by focal iliopsoas tenderness pain on resisted hip flexion pain with flexion  preserved other ROM  nil systemic sx  
Less likely

3  Lumbar radiculopathy  nil neuropathic sx SLR − neuro intact  
4  Femoral neck stress # / AVN  able to WB pain pattern not classic but needs exclusion if persists or ↑

P  
1  Ix  
Given after hours setting stable obs no red flags  defer urgent imaging  
For usual GP within 1–2/52  
 - XR pelvis + R hip AP/lat  r/o OA structural change #  
 - Consider US hip / iliopsoas vs MRI if sx persist or worsen or if XR non diagnostic  
Nil urgent bloods or CT tonight as afebrile systemically well  

2  Meds  
Analgesia  
 - Advise ibuprofen 400mg PO TDS with food up to 5/7 PRN pain if nil hx ulcer renal disease NSAID allergy  
 - Paracetamol 1g PO QID PRN max 4g/24h as baseline  
Discussed NSAID risks GI renal CV advised cease and see GP if abdo pain black stools etc  

3  Non pharm  
Relative rest from aggravating activities avoid repetitive deep hip flexion prolonged floor sitting over next 1–2/52  
Heat pack to R groin/hip 10–15min several times per day  
Gentle hip flexor stretches shown briefly avoid pushing into marked pain  
Suggested usual GP to ref for physio for structured program once dx confirmed
