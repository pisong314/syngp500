32y M, electrician  

Reason: genral check, mentions L eye injury  

HPC  
L eye trauma 2 days ago at work. Drilling overhead into metal frame, wearing safty glasses but felt “somthing flick into my eye” L side. Immediate gritty feel + watering. Rinsed with bottled water onsite + shower that night.  

Since then:  
- persistant FB sensatoin L eye  
- mild ache ~2/10, tearing, mild photophobia  
- vision L “a bit blurry” but can still read phone, drive  
- denies diplopia, severe pain, flashes, curtain, bad HA, N/V  
- no chemiccal exposure (metal dust/shavings only)  
No prev eye dz, no specs/contacts, no prior eye surgery.  

OE (focused)  
Obs: well, NAD, vitals WNL.  
Eyes: L conj mild injected laterally. No periorbital swelling, no disch. PERRL, EOM full, non‑painful.  
VA: R 6/6, L 6/9 → 6/7.5 pinhole.  
Cornea by pen torch looks clear centrally but ?small metallic FB at superolateral limbus – hard to excl. No obvious hypopyon, no gross AC abnorm, no obvious globe deformity, no visible penetrating obj.  
No flourescein / Seidel done here – concern possible deeper injury, prefer ED/ophth.  

Impression  
1) L ocular trauma – ?corneal FB, poss non‑penetrating vs occult penetrating injury after high‑speed metal drilling. Mild ↓VA, persisting FB sensation >24hrs. No clear open globe signs but mech high risk → needs URGENT ED/ophthal assesment, slit lamp, lids eversion, flourescein, consider imaging to excl IOFB.  
2) Genral health check – appears well, no known chronic dz. Time limited today due to eye.  

Plan  
- Do NOT attempt FB removal in GP.  
- Avoid topical anaesthetic/abx drops here until open globe ruled out.  
- Adv: no rubbing L eye, keep gently closed. Rigid eye shield/pad applied over bony orbit for transfer.  
- URGENT ED: phoned local tertiary ED, spoke triage nurse, handover given re high‑speed metal injury, persistant FB sensatoin, mild ↓VA, no obvious globe rupture. Pt to go straight to ED now, partner driving (pt not to drive).  
- Letter sent with pt: req urgent ophthalmology review, slit lamp, flourescein, lid eversion, imaging as indicated, and consider systemic abx if penetrating injury (eTG – eg moxiflox 400mg dly 5–7d or cipro 750mg BD 5–7d). Also asked ED to check tetanus status and update if not current.  

- Safety net: attend ED today; if any worsening pain, vision drop, flashes, curtain etc → immed help. RTC GP after ED or earlier if probs.  

Gen health (very brief today)  
- Non‑smoker, ETOH ~6 std/wk.  
- Encourged improv diet/exercise, but will review properley at longer appt.  
- Will org FBC, lipids, fasting glucose etc next visit (S&N path form not given today – to do later).  

Follow‑up  
- GP review 2–4 wks for full preventative check and to review ED/ophthal outcome, PPE at work etc.  

Billing: private billing, stand consult, gap $45. Bulk bill not applied today.
