Reason for visit  
R/V eye injury results L eye  

HPI  
32yo male carpenter Anglo-Australian based Newcastle  
Here alone today  

Eye injury 5/7 ago while grinding metal @ work  
Says had safety glasses on but "reckon something snuck in round the side" sudden irritation watering L eye  
Seen here same day FB suspected sent to ED ophthal  

ED same day per pt "they pulled a little bit of metal out" from L cornea fluorescein done Seidel neg no penetrating injury per ED letter chloramphenicol 0.5% gtts QID 5/7 + lubricants PRN  

Today  
Says "heaps beter" mild scratchy sensation L eye esp end of work day intermittent awareness of eye  
Nil sig pain nil photophobia nil purulent d/c  
Vision "back to normal"  
Nil flashes floaters curtain or sig blur  
Nil fevers or systemic sx  

Pt queries  
- if AC in ute "blowing right on my face" slowing healing  
- if ↑coffee could be "drying the eye out"  

Work context  
FT carpenter frequent dust metal wood fragments  
Usually wears safety glasses admits sometimes lifts when foggy "just for a sec to wipe em"  
Nil CL use  
Nil prev sig eye dz or surgery  
Tetanus up to date workplace medical 2yrs ago  

Collateral  
Partner not present but per pt "missus was pretty worried at first now thinks its all sorted"

Assessment  
1 Superficial corneal FB injury L eye 5/7 ago now improving  
   - Non penetrating metallic FB while grinding 2° work exposure FB removed same day in ED  
   - Current exam consistent with healing superficial corneal abrasion VA 6/6 nil features infective keratitis or endophthalmitis low risk but not zero given trauma recent  

   Differentials discussed in detail with pt incl  
   - Infectious keratitis  
   - Corneal ulcer  
   - Herpetic keratitis  
   - Uveitis  
   - Penetrating globe / IOFB  
   - Acute angle closure  
   - Retinal tear/detachment re flashes floaters curtain sx  
   Explained why these are less likely today given hx exam and ED ophthal findings  

2 Occupational eye hazard carpenter PPE suboptimal at times  
   Ongoing ↑risk recurrent eye injury opportunity for prevention  

Plan  
1 L eye injury / corneal abrasion post FB  
   - Complete chloramphenicol course today day 5/5 no extension indicated in absence of infective features discussed risks/benefits of longer abx course incl resistance allergy unnecessary exposure pt agreed to cease after today  
   - Continue lubricating drops eg Systane 1–2 gtts each eye PRN esp at work and in dry AC environments  
     Reassured AC + ↑coffee may contribute mild dryness only not delaying epithelial healing in this case  
   - Analgesia simple paracetamol or ibuprofen PRN if discomfort currently nil required  

   Extensive discussion held 10:15–10:23 re  
   - Natural hx corneal abrasion expected healing timeframe  
   - Very small but serious risk post traumatic infectious keratitis / endophthalmitis typically 3–5/7 post injury  
   - Importance of early presentation if deterioration  

   Red flag / safety net advice (explained slowly repeated x2 pt asked to repeat back)  
   Must attend ED urgently (not wait for GP appt) if  
   - sudden ↑pain L eye or feels "real crook"  
   - marked ↑redness or any pus d/c  
   - new photophobia  
   - new floaters flashes or shadow / "curtain" over vision  
   - sudden drop in vision either eye  
   Also to r/v here sooner if persistent scratchy sx >10–14/7 or any concern  
   Pt able to verbalise understanding and states "if it blows up or goes blurry I go straight to emergency not muck around"  

   Written info  
   - Provided printed Healthdirect info sheet on eye injuries / corneal abrasion 10:24 documented given  
   - Advised to keep sheet on fridge for red flag reminder  

2 Occupational prevention  
   Discussed 10:24–10:30 in depth  
   - Need for properly fitting wrap around safety glasses or face shield esp for grinding cutting  
   - Suggested anti fog models to ↓need to lift glasses  
   - Encouraged discussion with employer / HSR re better PPE options and fit testing  
   - Explained risk of recurrent injury and potential permanent vision loss if deeper injury next time  
   Pt states "yeah fair enough I dont want to lose an eye over being lazy" agrees to talk to boss  

   Documented that pt understands workplace obligations + right to adequate PPE  

3 F/U  
   - GP r/v 1/52 if ongoing irritation visual changes or if not fully settled  
   - Otherwise PRN  
   - Clear instruction to attend ED immediately for any red flag sx as above emphasised time critical nature if infection or deeper injury develops pt confirms understanding  

Time  
Approx 15 mins face to face majority spent on result explanation detailed risk discussion prevention counselling and safety netting
