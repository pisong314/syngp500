22/11/25  after hours

58F (Anglo-Aust, office admin) new to clinic – “just a check-up, I’m not usually out this way in the evening”. Ends up mainly about heart “flutter”.

Hx sort of scattered – says generally well, no regular meds, “don’t want to be a bother”. Over last few months gets brief episodes of heart “skips then thumps”, mostly evenings sitting watching TV. Few times/week, lasts seconds. Not with walking to/from transport (20–30 mins most days). No CP, no SOB, no dizziness/syncope, no neuro sx. Thinks maybe related to coffee at work or wine Friday nights. No recent illness.

Says old GP told her ~1–2 yrs ago ECG showed “a few extra heartbeats” but was reassured. No known HTN, DM, IHD, thyroid issues. NKDA. Never smoker, drinks some wine with dinner.

Obs: BP 132/78, HR 74 reg, RR 14, afebrile, sats 98% RA. Looks well, chatting in full sentences.

CVS exam: HS dual, no obvious murmur, rhythm sounded regular while listening, no oedema. Chest clear. Thyroid not obviously enlarged.

ECG today (onsite): sinus ~72 bpm, occasional isolated PACs seen, no AF/flutter, intervals ok, no ischaemic ST-T changes. No prior ECG here to compare.

Imp:
– Palpitations – likely benign atrial ectopics / PACs, haemodynamically stable, no red flag features (no exertional CP, no syncope, no FHx SCD reported).  
– General health check requested but limited after-hours, no records.

Plan:
– Reassured re isolated PACs, explained common/benign in structurally normal hearts. No meds started – symptoms mild, pt happy to “just keep an eye on it”.  
– Suggested cutting down caffeine (aim ≤2 coffees/day, esp avoid later in day) and moderating alcohol. Maintain usual walking.  
– No beta blocker for now – discussed option if becomes more frequent/bothersome.  
– Advised urgent review/ED if palpitations with chest pain, marked SOB, collapse/near-syncope, or prolonged fast pounding HR that doesn’t settle.

– Asked to book longer routine appt with usual GP in next 2–4/52 for proper check-up: CV risk assessment, routine bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, fasting glucose/HbA1c, TSH) and consider Holter if sx ↑ or change. Age-appropriate screening to be done there (bowel, breast, cervical if due).

No scripts changed/started today.  
No f/up booked here – to see own GP; can return here if can’t get in or if sx worse.  

(Printed brief summary for pt to take to her GP – ECG showing PACs, no acute concerns.)
