Today: “heaps better than when I went in”  
No fevers/rigors, pain ↓, still mod yellow/brown malodorous PV loss but ↓ from ED. Mild crampy suprapubic pain only, on/off Panadol helpful. Eating/drinking ok. BF “going fine”  

Missed 1 dose abx o/night (baby unsettled) took this am  

Pt queries: baths “did I cause it by having a couple of baths” / energy drink “does that make it worse” – reassured

Ix today  
FBE, CRP, U&E, LFTs ordered (monitor response)  
No repeat swabs – recently done in hosp. Need hosp results (FBE, cultures, swabs/NAAT) → will chase via discharge summary/path portal  

Dx  
1) Puerperal sepsis / postpartum endometritis – clinically improving, afebrile, haemodynamically stable, discharge + pain trending ↓, tolerating PO  
2) Hx GBS colonisation – covered by current abx  
3) Early postnatal review – BF established, mood ok today  

Plan  
– Continue amox/clav 875/125 bd → at least 7d total PO (after IV). Consider extend to 10d if still symptomatic D7  
– Analgesia: cont Panadol PRN; can add ibuprofen 400mg tds PRN with food if needed  
– Reassured safe with BF; watch bub for loose stools/thrush  
– Avoid baths/swimming/tampons until lochia/infection settled → showers only for now  
– No US today – improving and no heavy PV bleed or severe pain. If not improving / any ↑ pain, PV bleed, fevers next 48–72h → urgent review, pelvic US ± re-admit  
– Red flags discussed: “if I get crook again” → ED if T ≥38, rigors, ↑ abdo/pelvic pain, heavy PV bleed/clots, foul smell ↑, SOB, CP, dizzy, can’t keep meds/fluids down  
– Booked review 3d for reassessment + bloods  
– Longer 6/40 postnatal check to do mood/contraception/cervical screen etc (already in recall list from 18/11 – keep)
