Reason for visit  
F/U rash on legs feet  

HPI  
76yo male Anglo Aus ex construction now retired lives remote with wife  
Known PAD COPD CVD CKD HTN HLD OA knees  
Here for r/v mottled rash both lower legs toes x ~10–14/7  
Says "just a bit of a mottled look nothing really" wife (not here) pushed him to come  

R foot toes esp great + 2nd toe feel cold tingling at night abit sore if on them a lot  
Claudication R calf/foot walking to mailbox ~150–200m needs to stop pain settles in few mins  
Nil sudden severe pain nil trauma nil ulcers that he knows of but admits doesnt look much  
Nil fevers rigors sweats  

On more detailed Q says sometimes woken by dull ache forefoot R>L improves when leg dangled off bed  
No frank rest pain all night but sounds early CLI  
Pt very stoic repeats "dont want to be a bother"  

Thinks rash maybe from new washing powder or bore water but timing not clear

Ix  
Path forms to Sullivan Nicolaides today  
FBC UEC eGFR LFT CRP ESR fasting lipids HbA1c C3 C4 eosinophils (aware some may be sendaway)  
Request repeat ABI/LL Dopplers ideally @ vascular centre limited local access  

Dx / Impression  
1 PAD likely progression with intermittent claudication and evolving chronic limb ischaemia R foot livedo type rash more in keeping with ischaemic/vascular change than dermatitis  
   No features acute limb ischaemia today (nil sudden severe pain nil motor loss nil profound sensory loss)  
2 ?cholesterol micro emboli contributing to digital ischaemia toes + livedo in setting widespread atherosclerosis CKD needs vascular input  
3 High CV risk profile age male ex smoker PAD CVD CKD HTN HLD  
4 COPD CVD CKD stable today  

Plan  
Vascular / CV  
Discussed concerns re circulation to legs toes explained risk tissue loss poss amputation pt initially minimises but agrees to further workup  
Urgent (but not ED today) referral vascular surgery at nearest tertiary centre  
– eReferral via HealthLink + fax marked URGENT  
   for assessment progressing PAD consideration angiogram ± revascularisation  
   clarify if livedo / digital changes likely cholesterol emboli  
   advise on optimal antithrombotic regimen in CKD elderly  

Antithrombotic  
– Continue aspirin 100 mane  
– Dual therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel or low dose rivaroxaban) discussed as option given polyvascular disease defer change until vascular/renal/cardiology advice due ↑bleeding risk  

BP  
– Current BP on lower side but acceptable avoid ↑antihypertensives for now  
– Continue perindopril amlodipine same doses r/v after vascular opinion if ongoing CLI may tolerate slightly higher SBP for perfusion  

Lipids  
– Continue atorvastatin 40 nocte  
– Fasting lipids ordered adjust later if off target  

Local limb care  
Basic foot care advice given high risk limb  
– Daily foot check self or wife including between toes soles  
– Keep feet warm protected avoid barefoot avoid direct heat packs  
– Moisturiser for dry skin avoid picking scratching  
– Clean dry dressing over fissure R great toe if rubbing in shoe simple non adherent  
Pressure advice avoid long periods feet dependent w/o movement but also avoid prolonged elevation above heart if ↑pain  

Analgesia  
– Paracetamol 1g up to QID PRN max 4g/24h reminded  
– Opioids may be needed if pain escalates or rest pain develops pt currently declines says "Ive put up with worse" advised to seek help if pain ↑  

Comorbid  
COPD stable inhaler tech quickly checked nil change today  
CVD on aspirin statin BP ok nil new neuro sx  
CKD UEC ordered reminded avoid NSAIDs esp OTC ibuprofen  

Safety net  
Advised urgent ED / call ambulance or RFDS if  
– sudden severe leg or foot pain  
– marked ↑coldness or colour change esp pale blue or black  
– new numbness or weakness in leg foot  
– rapid skin breakdown black areas or spreading redness warmth swelling pus fevers  
Also ED if new chest pain TIA/stroke sx sudden SOB  
Generic advice also given re fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion to seek urgent care  

F/U  
R/v 1/52 to check path results toe lesion rash pain function confirm vascular appt + transport  
Telehealth option if cant attend though exam limited  
Earlier review PRN if deterioration as above  

Billing  
Standard long consult billed MBS item 36 bulk billed
