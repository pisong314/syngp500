Pt: 58y F  

Reason for visit:  
F/U anxietty, c/o ongoing “changes down there” – dryness, stingging, urinary freq.

HPC (brief):  
~6–9 mths vag dryness, “stinging” + “tightness”, worse after walking / at night.  
Mild dysruia, urinary freq ~hrly day, 1–2x noc. No haematuria, no PMB. Not sexually active.  
Very worried re “vaginal cancer”, lots of googling, asking for “scan or biopsy”. Hx health anxietty, using internet for sx checking, sleep poor but no SI.

Menopause at ~52, no HRT. Last CST ~2 yrs ago per pt, normal (not yet seen in NCSR).

Examination (focused):  
Obs: BP 126/78, HR 78, afebrile, BMI 25.3.  
Abdo soft NT.  
Pelvic (chaperone offered, declined): vulva + vag mucosa pale, thin, dry, ↓rugae, small erythema posterior fornix, no ulcers/masses, no bleed. Cervix NAD. Bimanual: uterus/adnexae normal, no prolapse.  
No clinical red flags for malignanccy today.

Impression:  
1. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause / vag atrophy – sympomatic (dryness, discomfort, urinary freq/urgency). Exam c/w atrophic change, no PMB, no suspicious lesion.  
2. Health anxietty – exacerbation, focussed on gynae ca.  
3. Urinary freq/urgency – likely secondary to atrophic changes, r/o UTI.

Plan:  

Vag atrophy / urinary sx  
- Explained findings c/w menopausal atrophy, no signs of ca today; advs to report any new PMB or bloody discharge.  
- Start estriol 1 mg/g vag cream (Ovestin generic PBS):  
  • 0.5 g PV nocte x 2–3 wks, then ↓ to 1–2x/week maintenence.  
  • Long term use likely; discused low systemic absorpsion, ok given no breast ca hx.  
- Recomm vag moisturiser OTC (e.g. Replens/Sylk) on non-cream nights; lube PRN if becomes sexually active.

Tests:  
- MSU for M/C/S today – sent to Sullivan Nicolaides, to excl UTI. Results via HealthLink / recall if abn.  
- Check NCSR – if CST >5 yrs or not recorded, will arrage CST at next review (time limited today).

Anxietty / MH:  
- Reassured re current low suspision for ca.  
- Encouraged to limit googling re sx.  
- Internal referrral to psych (CBT for health anxietty, coping with menopause sx) – sent to community MH / in-house psych, advised wait list.  
- Brief supportive chat today, will need longer MH appt if persisting.

Follow up:  
- Review 6–8 wks: assess response to estriol, check MSU result, review anxietty + psych progress, confirm CST status.  
- Earlier if PMB, new pelvic pain, offensive/bloody discharge, systemic sx or anxietty markedly worse.

Billing:  
- Level B, bulk billed (pt low income).
