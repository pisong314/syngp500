Mx  
1) GSM  
– Discussed common post-MP oestrogen ↓ not hygiene issue  
– Start estriol 1 mg/g vag cream  
  • 0.5 g PV nocte 2–3/52 then ↓ to 1–2x/week maintenance  
  • Small amount to introitus prn  
– Advise regular non-hormonal vag moisturiser + lubricant with intercourse (pt aware of OTC “Replens / Sylk type”)  
– Counsel re safety: low-dose local oestrogen ok long term minimal systemic abs. Pt asked “is this safe at my age?” → reassured.  
– Red flags: any PV bleeding / new pain / abn discharge → review ASAP
