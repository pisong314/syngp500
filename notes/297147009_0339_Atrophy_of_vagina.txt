Behaviour: tangential, lots of side stories, needs redirection but engages once focused  

Exam  
Phone only, no obs. Pt reports afebrile, feels otherwise well, working as usual  

Impression  
↑ urinary freq in postmenopausal F, no dysuria/systemic sx → UTI less likely  
Likely genitourinary syndrome of menopause / vulvovaginal atrophy → urinary freq/urgency + dryness + dyspareunia  
No red flag sx on hx but new pt → needs IP exam + urine  

Plan  
– Book IP review 1–2/52 for:  
  • Dipstick + MSU M/C/S  
  • Pelvic exam incl speculum + bimanual → ?atrophy, lesions, discharge, prolapse, haematuria  
– Start non-hormonal now:  
  • Vaginal moisturiser (e.g. Replens/Sylk) 2–3x/wk  
  • Lube with intercourse, avoid soaps/perfumes to vulva  
  • ↓ caffeine esp arvo/evening, avoid large fluids late night  

– Discussed likely low oestrogen cause, reassured re local oestrogen safety in general terms  
– Will consider vaginal oestrogen (estriol cream 0.5 g nocte 2–3/52 then 1–2x/wk OR 500 mcg pessaries same regimen) at IP review if exam/urine consistent and no contraindications  

Safety net  
ED/urgent review if fever, flank/severe abdo pain, visible haematuria, new PV bleeding, urinary retention or severe burning  
RTC IP 1–2/52 as above  
Fatigue mentioned briefly → separate longer appt if ongoing
