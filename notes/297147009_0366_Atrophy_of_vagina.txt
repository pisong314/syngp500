62F review  

CC: throat feels "tight and dry when I swallow" + vaginal dryness  

HPC  
Throat sx 3–4/12 intermittent tightness low throat/upper chest when swallowing saliva, occas liquids. No true odynophagia. No dysphagia solids, no food sticking. Aware of throat but denies classic globus. Mild hoarseness esp after long retail shifts talking "all day at the shop". No cough, no choking/aspiration, no wt loss, no fevers/NS. No typical GORD but occas "sour taste" if lies down soon after dinner. Non-smoker, minimal ETOH. Pt worried re thyroid "could this be early thyroid enlargement"  

Vaginal sx: known postmenopausal vaginal atrophy ~18/12, on Sylk 2–3x/wk + lube PRN. Still dryness + dyspareunia, mild ↑ urinary freq, no dysuria/urgency/incont, no PV bleeding. Asking re "systemic absorption" + "cardiovascular and breast cancer risk" of topical oestrogen vs moisturiser only. No Hx VTE/CVD. No HRT currently  

Exam  
Obs WNL, BMI ~25  
Throat: OP clear, mild post pharyngeal erythema/cobblestoning, no masses. Voice mildly husky initially → improved.  
Neck: no LAD, thyroid not enlarged, no nodules, NT.  
Chest: clear  

Ix  
No prior bloods on file for this issue  
Plan bloods if persisting: TFTs, FBC, CRP (not ordered today – time)  

A/P  
1) Throat discomfort / ?LPR / vocal strain  
- No red flags today (no progressive dysphagia, wt loss, neck mass, haemoptysis)  
- Reassured re thyroid clinically normal  
- Trial PPI: esomeprazole 20 mg mane x4/52 (PBS)  
- Basic reflux + voice strain advice given (avoid late meals, ↑ fluids at work etc)  
- RTC 4–6/52 or earlier if worse (true dysphagia esp solids, odynophagia, wt loss, persistent hoarseness >6/52, fevers/NS)  
- If no better → ENT for nasendoscopy  

2) Postmenopausal vaginal atrophy – persistent  
- Moisturiser alone inadequate  
- Discussed options incl topical oestrogen. Explained low systemic absorption esp estriol, no clear ↑ CVD/VTE/breast Ca risk in current data, avoid if unexplained PV bleed  
- Pt prefers estriol cream  
Rx: Estriol 1 mg/g vaginal cream  
  • 0.5 g PV nocte 2–3/52 then ↓ to 1–2x/wk maint  
  • Continue Sylk on non-oestrogen days if needed  
- Warned re local irritation/discharge, advise if any PV bleeding or new pelvic pain → review  

3) Other  
- Pt asked briefly re systemic HRT "for my bones" – deferred, advised long appt for full menopause/bone health review incl FRAX/DXA etc. Book longer review 3/12 (was going to put 6/12)  

No tests ordered today – will consider TFTs + ENT referral if sx persist at f/up.
