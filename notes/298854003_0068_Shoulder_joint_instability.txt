# Assessment  
1 Recurrent L shoulder instability likely atraumatic / multidirectional currently symptomatic w ↑ near sublux episodes assoc w manual OH work  
2 Occupational impact apprentice chippy needing stable shoulder for heavy / OH tasks  
No current red flags nil evidence acute dislocation today  

Functional assessment (as best possible via phone)  
ROM  
- Active elevation to >160° per pt but apprehension / looseness around mid range abd  
- Functional IR / ER not fully assessable telehealth  
Strength  
- Gross functional strength preserved for light activities per pt  
- Perceived ↓ control / stability esp OH and in abd + ER position  
Activity limits  
- Avoiding OH work ply lifting  
- Avoiding contact sport gym OH press  
Participation goals  
- Wants to keep apprenticeship maintain full duties long term return to social sport safely  

Plan  

1 Education  
Explained shoulder instability likely capsulolabral + dynamic stabiliser issue  
Emphasis on rotator cuff scap stabiliser strength neuromuscular control  
Avoid high risk positions for now abd + ER sudden pulls heavy OH lifts  
Safety net attend ED / urgent r/v if complete dislocation deformity sudden severe pain unable move shoulder or new neuro Sx arm / hand  

2 Conservative mx / functional rehab  
Strongly rec restart structured physio  
- Rf: local MSK physio near pt suburb for shoulder stability program  
  Focus  
  - Rotator cuff strength esp ER IR in scap plane  
  - Scapular control lower trap / SA activation  
  - Closed chain stability drills progressing to open chain OH  
  - Work specific functional rehab graded exposure to OH lifting awkward loads manual handling  
Asked physio to provide work oriented plan written restrictions if needed  

Work modification  
Advised discuss w supervisor temp light duties minimise heavy OH work large awkward loads esp away from body  
Offered med cert / employer letter re modified duties pt keen will organise next visit or via email  

3 Analgesia  
Ok to cont ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN w food max 1200mg/24h avoid >3–5/7 consecutively  
Warned re GI upset black stools etc seek r/v if occurs  
Can use paracetamol 1g QID PRN alt / add on max 4g/24h  

4 Ix  
Nil urgent imaging today pattern chronic stable no acute trauma  
Plan  
- If sx persist >6–8/52 despite physio OR ↑ freq/severity of events → in person r/v  
  Consider  
  - XR L shoulder AP axillary scap Y to assess bony lesions  
  - Then poss ref sports physician / ortho ± MRI arthrogram if ongoing instability ?labral pathology  

5 F/U  
Book F2F in ~4/52  
- Reassess stability functional capacity work tolerance physio progress  
- Provide employer letter if needed  
- Do brief gen health check as requested today deferred due to time focus on shoulder  
Earlier r/v if ↑ near sublux any full dislocation new neuro Sx or red flags  

Behaviour / engagement  
Pt talkative tangential multiple digressions to school sport old jobs mates w shoulder issues required gentle redirection several times  
Despite this engaged w plan verbalised understanding of rehab focus and work mods
