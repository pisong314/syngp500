24M apprentice chippy – R shoulder  

HPC  
Ongoing R shoulder “feels like it’ll pop out” esp OH work (plasterboard, tools). 1st injury ~18/12 ago FOOSH playing footy → ?ant dislocation per ED, no surg. Since then recurrent sublux/giving way, 1 clear dislocation self-reduced ~6/12 ago. No ED since.  
Pain 3–5/10 ant/lat, activity-related only, no true rest/night pain unless arm OH. No paraesthesia/weakness/neck sx. Using Nurofen 400mg PRN few times/wk. Did physio ~6/52 last yr then stopped. Wants work cert / what he can safely do.  

OE (focused)  
Vitals WNL, BMI ~24  
R shoulder: no deformity/wasting. Mild ant GH jt TTP. ROM near full but apprehension end-range abd/ER. Cuff power 5/5.  
+ve apprehension + relocation. Mild + sulcus vs L. Impingement tests only mild discomfort. NV intact. L shoulder + C-spine NAD.  

Impression  
1. Recurrent R shoulder instability – likely traumatic ant instability / capsulolabral lesion (Bankart-type) in young manual worker  
2. Work capacity issues – heavy OH manual labour  
3. NSAID use intermittent – ok currently  

Plan  
- Imaging: XR R shoulder (AP/axillary/scap Y) today – r/o bony lesion, Hill-Sachs, glenoid loss etc. If XR NAD but ongoing instability → consider MRI arthrogram R shoulder pending response to rehab.  
- Work: Fit for mod duties only x4/52 → avoid heavy lifting >~5–7kg above shoulder height, no repetitive OH power tools. Cert completed.  
- Physio: Refer local sports/shoulder physio → structured rehab (RC + scap stabilisers, proprioception). Emphasised adherence over months.  
- Meds:  
  - Paracetamol 1g QID PRN suggested first-line  
  - Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food, max ~5 days cont use, avoid empty stomach  
  - No opioids  
- Advice: Avoid posns of abd + ER under load (throwing, OH lifting/drilling). Use help/mech aids where poss. Sleep with shoulder neutral if can. Hydrate better, cut back energy drinks (brief).  
- Safety net: ED if frank dislocation / obvious deformity / severe pain or new neuro deficit. RTC if episodes ↑ or pain escalating.  

F/up  
Review 4–6/52 → check XR, physio progress, work tolerance. If persistent instability / recurrent sublux despite rehab → consider MRI arthrogram + ortho/sports med referral. Pt able to repeat plan.
