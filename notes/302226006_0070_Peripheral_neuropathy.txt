GP Reg: Dr _____  
Supervisor: Dr _____  

Reason for visit  
Request for completion of Housing Commission / Centrelink disability/mobility paperwork  
Pt: “need this done today properly none of that rubbish you wrote last time”  

HPI  
68yo male retired construction worker known peripheral neuropathy LL and hx ischaemic CVA 2021  
Attends specifically for forms re priority housing access  

Peripheral neuropathy  
Longstanding burning pain + numbness both feet to mid calf yrs “getting worse”  
Pins + needles feet ↓ balance occasional trips over kerbs “nearly went over last week” nil recent actual fall  
Nil new weakness nil bowel or bladder sx  
Has not been regularly checking feet says “I dont really look”  

Attributes neuropathy to “chemicals on site” very dismissive of role of ETOH “you’re wrong I know my body”  
States internet says nerves can be “fixed with vitamins” taking OTC B complex intermittently  
Alcohol intake – “few beers most nights” reluctant to quantify becomes irritated when explored “it’s not about the booze it’s about my nerves and this bloody form”  

Mobility fxn  
Can walk ~50–100m only due to pain numbness and fear of losing balance “stairs are a nightmare”  
Lives alone 3rd floor walk up no lift must use rail and stop on way up esp end of day  
Avoids crowded PT as worried will be knocked off balance  
Requesting documentation that he needs ground floor or lift access “I cant keep doing these stairs”  

Cerebrovascular disease  
Hx ischaemic stroke 4 yrs ago mild residual L sided clumsiness per old notes still independent ADLs  
Nil new focal neuro sx nil TIA sx  

Consult dynamics  
Pt argumentative frequently interrupts challenges explanations “that’s not what the internet says”  
Voice raised at times but settles with clear boundaries  
Trying to raise multiple issues including lengthy discussion re “nerve detox” supplements  
Explained limited time today focus on functional status + brief neuropathy r/v offered longer appt another day re tx options and ETOH use pt dismissive but “might think about it”  

PMHx  
- Peripheral neuropathy length dependent sensory > motor NCS 2022 axonal pattern no clear CIDP  
- Alcohol use disorder ongoing  
- Ischaemic stroke 2021  
- HTN  
- Hyperlipidaemia  
- ?IGT borderline HbA1c 2023 (can’t see exact value in summary)  

Meds (per record partly confirmed)  
- Aspirin 100mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
- Perindopril 5mg mane  
- Pregabalin 75mg bd for neuropathic pain pt admits taking PRN “when I feel like it”  
- Thiamine 100mg daily “sometimes forgets”  
NKDA  

Social  
Lives alone rental unit 3rd floor walk up nil lift limited family support ex wife + adult kids interstate minimal contact  
Retired construction on aged pension financial stress worried about losing current unit if can’t get priority housing  
Not driving by choice feels legs “dodgy”  

O/E  
Vitals BP 138/82 HR 78 reg RR 14 afebrile SpO2 97% RA  
Gen thin older man mildly dishevelled smell of alcohol on breath appears not intoxicated  
Gait wide based slow uses walls/furniture in corridor  

Neuro focused LL  
Tone normal power 5/5 throughout  
Reflexes knee ↓ bilat ankle jerks absent  
Sensation ↓ LT and pin to mid calf bilat ↓ vibration + proprioception at great toes/ankles  
Allodynia to light touch dorsum feet  
Romberg + unsteady eyes closed  
Gait cautious difficulty tandem able heel/toe only briefly  

Feet  
Skin intact mild heel callus nil ulcers nil deformity DP/PT pulses palpable nil warmth or erythema  

CVS/Resp  
HS dual no added sounds chest clear  

Assessment  
1 Peripheral neuropathy chronic predominantly sensory length dependent likely multifactorial 2° ETOH + possible vascular/metabolic contribution appears stable but progressive impact on fxn  
2 Marked functional limitation mobility + stair use due to neuropathy and mild post CVA deficits lives alone 3rd floor walk up ⇒ ↑ falls risk appears to meet criteria for need for ground floor or lift access housing  
3 Alcohol use disorder ongoing pt in pre contemplative stage strongly minimising link to neuropathy  
4 Hx ischaemic stroke 2021 appears clinically stable on 2° prevention but residual deficit contributes to balance issues  

Plan  
Forms / fxn  
- Completed Housing / Centrelink forms today based on objective findings  
  • Documented chronic peripheral neuropathy with sensory loss to mid calf absent ankle reflexes impaired balance + +Romberg  
  • Documented difficulty walking >50–100m need for rail on stairs requirement to stop on stairs lives alone nil regular carer  
  • Recommended ground floor or lift access accommodation handrails in common areas avoidance of housing requiring frequent stair use  
- Explained to pt forms must reflect objective exam not “what the internet says” pt unhappy but ultimately allowed completion  

Neuropathy sx  
- Encouraged regular pregabalin 75mg bd rather than PRN explained may ↓ pain and improve sleep though wont reverse nerve damage  
- Pt reluctantly agreed to trial taking as prescribed for 2–3/52  
- Foot care discussed briefly daily inspection (mirror if needed) well fitting shoes avoid barefoot seek r/v early if redness blister or break in skin  

Alcohol use / risk factors  
- Reiterated strong link between ETOH and neuropathy and stroke risk pt rejects this “I’m not an alcoholic I just need this form sorted”  
- Offered AOD service referral + counselling pt declined today readiness to change low  
- Advised to continue thiamine 100mg daily  

CVD prevention / bloods  
- Continue aspirin 100mg atorvastatin 40mg perindopril 5mg  
- Suggested update bloods FBE U&E LFTs B12 folate fasting BSL/HbA1c lipids  
- Pt declined today wants to “get out of here” pathology form printed for later use if he attends  
- Note last BP trend improving 152/90 → 144/86 → 138/82 over ~18/12  

Falls / supports  
- Discussed ↑ falls risk advised strict use of rails avoid carrying heavy loads on stairs ensure good lighting  
- Offered physio for balance/strength training pt dismissive today will revisit  
- Consider podiatry r/f next visit re ongoing foot care esp if housing situation changes  

F/U  
- Suggested long r/v 2–3/52 to reassess neuropathic sx after pregabalin trial review bloods if done revisit ETOH use consider referrals  
- Pt tentatively agreed but said “might not bother if nothing changes” advised can book sooner if any deterioration or fall  

Learning points (self)  
- Challenging consult with strong agenda from pt balancing advocacy for appropriate housing vs maintaining boundaries re content of forms  
- Need to improve strategies for motivational interviewing around ETOH esp when pt strongly defensive  
- Consider earlier involvement of supervisor in real time for complex communication / capacity issues  

Supervisor addendum – Dr _____ 22/11/25 16:40  
Reviewed case and documentation with registrar  
Agree neuropathy likely multifactorial with significant functional impact and that accessible housing is appropriate to support safety  
Form completion as described appropriate emphasising objective deficits and falls risk rather than speculative causes  
Agree pt currently pre contemplative re ETOH change reasonable to continue brief interventions and offer AOD referral each r/v  
Plan for long f/u in 2–3/52 to reassess pain control and reconsider investigations appropriate
