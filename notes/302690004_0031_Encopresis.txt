72F (retired admin) – constipation / “holding on to my bowels and getting blocked up again”  

Long hx functional constipation, faecal overflow. Seen here on/off last 2–3 yrs, lots of DNAs. Known to me.  

Today:  
- Several months ↑ stool holding as “it hurts when it finally comes out” + doesn’t like public toilets.  
- Opening bowels maybe 1–2x/week, very large hard stools, painful, sometimes blocks toilet.  
- Daily small-volume soiling in underwear last few weeks (“skid marks… just leaks out”).  
- Feels bloated, incomplete emptying, dull lower abdo discomfort.  
- Admits not taking Movicol as prescribed, ran out “weeks ago”, forgot to get more. Similar with perindopril/atorva – poor adherence generally.  

Neg: no PR blood, no melena, wt stable, no fevers, no N/V, no urinary sx, no neuro red flags (no saddle anaesthesia, leg weakness).  

PMHx (relevant):  
- Chronic functional constipation with prior faecal impactions, overflow incontinence.  
- HTN, hyperlipidaemia, OA knees.  
- Colonoscopy ~8 yrs ago reportedly normal.  

Meds (as actually taking):  
- Perindopril 5 mg mane – often missed.  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte – “when I remember”.  
- Movicol macrogol 3350 + electrolytes – currently nil.  
- Paracetamol PRN.  
NKDA.  

Lives alone, low activity, low fibre diet, mainly tea, limited water.  

Exam (focused):  
Looks well, mobile, a bit anxious, faint faecal odour.  
BP 138/82, HR 76 reg, afebrile, BMI ~26.  
Abdo: soft, mildly distended, generalised fullness esp LLQ, mild discomfort only, no peritonism, no obvious mass.  
PR (chaperone present): perianal irritation, small amount soft stool externally. Good tone. Rectum loaded with large amount firm stool, no discrete mass, no fissures/haemorrhoids seen, no fresh blood.  

Impression:  
1) Faecal impaction with overflow incontinence (encopresis) – clinically loaded rectum, classic hx of stool retention + daily soiling.  
2) Chronic functional constipation – behavioural (delaying defecation), low fibre/fluids, low activity, poor adherence to laxatives.  
3) Medication non-adherence / poor engagement – misses meds, DNAs, didn’t attend nurse bowel review or gastro appt.  

Plan (limited time today – bowels only, chronic disease review separate):  

- Oral disimpaction at home:  
  • Restart macrogol 3350 + electrolytes (Movicol).  
  • Days 1–3: 1 sachet hourly up to max 8/day (can space to 2‑hourly if cramps/bloating). Aim for large stool output / clear liquid stools.  
  • Then switch to maintenance: 1–2 sachets daily ongoing, titrate to keep soft stool at least every 1–2 days. Emphasised not to stop once better. Written instructions given.  

- Scripts:  
  • Movicol sachets – qty for 3–5 days intensive + ≥1 month maintenance. PBS script printed.  

- Simple routine advice only (kept brief): sit on toilet after meals, avoid “holding on”, keep feet supported. Encouraged ↑ water intake and a bit more fibre but didn’t go into huge detail today.  

- Ix:  
  FBE, U&E, LFT, Ca, Mg, PO4, fasting BSL, TSH ordered via Sullivan Nicolaides – baseline and to monitor with laxatives. Results pending. Will consider FIT / repeat colonoscopy discussion once settled.  

- Safety-net:  
  Told to seek urgent review / ED if severe abdo pain, vomiting, unable to pass wind, new PR bleeding/black stools, fever, or new urinary retention/leg weakness/numbness around anus.  

- Follow-up:  
  Review booked 1 week to check response to disimpaction, adjust Movicol dose, review bloods.  
  Separate longer 20‑min appt in 4–6 wks for HTN/lipids/med adherence (annual health check) – today not covered.  

Pt a bit reluctant about frequent toilet trips during disimpaction but agreed to start tomorrow when home all day. Declined nurse phone check; says will come back if “it’s not working”.  

Bulk billed.
