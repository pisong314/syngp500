56F Aboriginal pt walk in  

Reason for visit  
Req rpt script for "sugar tablets and the other ones" ran out  

Background  
Known T2DM per pt dx many yrs ago exact duration unclear ?10yrs  
Hx recurrent "low sugar" episodes per pt no records available today  
Nil known CKD or CLD per pt "no ones told me anything was wrong"  
Works supermarket checkout lives with sister  
Drives car only nil heavy machinery  

HPC  
Here for rpt diabetes meds unable to name meds or doses  
Describes 1 small white tab at night 1 larger tab in am  
Unclear if ever on insulin says had "pen thing in hospital once" then ceased  

For past few wks to possibly longer has episodes few times / wk esp late morning on work days when skips breaks  
Symptoms: shaky sweaty palpitations hungry dizzy ↓conc "funny in the head"  
Settles after juice or lollies  
Nil recent LOC nil seizures nil ambos  
One episode "few months ago" had to lie down in lunch room no med review  

Has glucometer at home but "doesnt check much" thinks out of strips  
Unable to recall BGLs vague hx of "too high and too low sugars" in past  
Nil clear hx severe hypo needing IV dextrose or glucagon that she recalls  

Pt queries if new energy drinks at work or cold aircon may be causing sx discussed unlikely as sole cause more likely impact on BGLs esp if replacing meals  

Diet often skips breakfast or just coffee sometimes misses smoko  
Evening meal takeaway or whatever sister cooks  
Alcohol minimal "hardly ever"  
Smokes on and off amount not quantified today  

Meds (uncertain)  
"Diabetes tablets" last script from another GP "maybe 3 mths or longer"  
Thinks one med can "make me go low if I dont eat" ?SU  
Denies current insulin use  
Nil known drug allergies  

FHx  
?father with "sugar problems" further detail unknown  

Systems (focused)  
Nil chest pain nil SOB nil focal neuro sx  
Nil current polyuria polydipsia  
Nil abdo pain vomiting  
Nil unintentional wt loss known  

Exam  
Gen alert orientated engaging vague historian NAD  
BP 132/78 HR 82 reg RR 14 SpO2 98% RA T 36.7  
Wt 86kg Ht 162cm BMI ~32.8  
CVS HS dual nil murmur nil oedema  
Resp clear bilat  
Neuro grossly non focal speech normal GCS 15  
Feet brief look only nil ulcers intact light touch to monofilament great toes bilat  

POC BGL 4.6 mmol/L non fasting approx 2h post last food  

Assessment  
1 T2DM control and regimen unclear high risk due to fragmented care and poor recall of meds likely on oral agents previously ?SU given hx of hypos  
2 Recurrent symptomatic non severe hypoglycaemia likely multifactorial SU 2° missed meals erratic monitoring physically and mentally demanding work shifts Aboriginal background ↑CVD risk  
3 Cardiometabolic risk factors obesity intermittent smoking Aboriginal pt ↑baseline CVD risk formal risk calc deferred  
4 Poor historian no external records today unsafe to represcribe unknown diabetes meds  

Extensive discussion held re possible causes of sx incl  
- true hypoglycaemia from SU or other insulin secretagogue esp when skipping meals  
- reactive hypo vs anxiety vs caffeine / energy drink related sx vs less likely arrhythmia vs autonomic dysfunction  
Explained serious but less likely differentials today eg ACS stroke seizure disorder adrenal insuff central pathology given nil red flags on hx/exam and normal obs today  

Discussed rationale for not represcribing unknown diabetes tablets today due to medico legal and pt safety concerns esp risk severe hypo if SU restarted without clarity re dose and renal function pt verbalised understanding  

Plan  

Meds  
Decision made not to represcribe any SU or unknown diabetes meds today  
Discussed options incl  
- cease all OHG temporarily and observe  
- start safer agent while awaiting records  
Agreed to trial metformin XR as baseline tx low hypo risk  
Metformin XR 500mg with evening meal 1 tab nocte for 1 wk then 2 tabs nocte if tolerated discussed GI SEs lactic acidosis risk in sig renal/hepatic impairment or severe illness advised to stop and seek review if vomiting severe diarrhoea SOB chest pain or feeling very unwell  
PBS script provided  

Explained explicitly that this is new plan may differ from previous GP plan and that once old records and bloods back regimen may change again pt agreed  

Hypoglycaemia education  
Detailed discussion re hypo sx causes and immediate mgmt  
Advised to always carry quick acting carb eg jelly beans glucose tabs juice  
Explained 15g rule 6–7 jelly beans or 3 tsp sugar in water wait 10–15min recheck BGL if able repeat if BGL <4 or sx persist then follow with longer acting carb snack once recovered  
Documented that pt able to repeat back steps though some concern re recall may need repetition next visit  

Monitoring  
Advised to obtain new test strips or bring glucometer next visit to check device and technique  
Asked to check BGL  
- most mornings pre work  
- whenever feels shaky sweaty or off  
Record in notebook to bring to next appt  

Driving and safety  
Discussed in detail Aust road safety considerations  
Currently nil severe hypos nil LOC nil crashes  
Advised not to drive if any hypo sx stop treat wait till fully recovered before resuming driving  
If any collapse seizure confusion or injury from suspected hypo must seek urgent review ED or 000 and driving may need to cease temp under Aust guidelines pt acknowledges  

Investigations  
QML fasting bloods ordered to be done within 1 wk  
- FBE  
- UEC eGFR  
- LFT  
- HbA1c  
- Fasting lipids  
- Urine ACR  

Explained purpose of each test esp checking renal function prior to ongoing metformin and to clarify long term control and CVD risk  

Records  
Pt believes previous GP clinic in [suburb]  
Written consent obtained to request full records inc med list recent pathology and any diabetes care plans faxed request sent during consult 15:40  
Documented that med regimen today based on pt recollection only pending confirmation  

Lifestyle  
Brief counselling today re regular meals emphasised importance of not skipping breakfast esp if on glucose lowering meds suggested simple options  
Discussed that energy drinks can cause large glucose swings and caffeine related sx not recommended as meal replacement  
Smoking briefly addressed pt "might think about cutting down" more detailed smoking cessation and wt mgmt deferred to longer diabetes r/v  

Risk discussion and consent  
Discussed risks benefits and alternatives of current plan including  
- risk of transient ↑BGL while off SU vs reduced risk of severe hypo  
- option of ED assessment today for serial BGLs and possible admission vs GP based monitoring  
Pt prefers community mgmt understands can present to ED or call 000 anytime if feels very unwell severe chest pain neuro sx or prolonged confusion  
Pt verbalised understanding of above and agreed to plan  

Safety net  
Clear safety net provided  
RTC urgently or ED/000 if  
- more frequent or more severe episodes esp any LOC seizure slurred speech confusion  
- chest pain SOB focal neuro sx sudden severe headache  
- vomiting unable to keep fluids down abdo pain  
- new rash swelling or SOB after starting metformin  
Otherwise book long diabetes review 1–2 wks  

Follow up  
Booked double appt 1–2/52 for structured diabetes r/v  
Plan at that visit  
- review blood results renal and liver function  
- review external records clarify previous regimen  
- assess HbA1c and decide on further therapy eg SGLT2i DPP4i etc depending on results CVD risk PBS affordability  
- full foot exam BP repeat CVD risk calc immunisation status smoking cessation support  
- reinforce hypo prevention and check for any hypo unawareness  

Admin / billing  
Bulk billed today  

Pt given brief written summary of plan start metformin XR dont skip meals carry lollies get bloods done bring glucometer and any old scripts next visit pt able to repeat key points at end of consult though memory remains a concern  

[Addendum 16:30 Dr J Brown]  
Phone call to pt mobile to reinforce fasting requirement for bloods and check if any new sx since consult pt reports feeling "ok" nil further episodes this afternoon confirms will attend QML within the next few days reminded to bring glucometer and any old boxes of meds to next r/v pt verbalises understanding  

Await path results and previous GP notes will r/v and contact pt earlier if any significant abnormalities identified
