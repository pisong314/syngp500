22/11/25  After hours UC

29F RN new pt  
CC: “worried something wrong with my brain / thinking getting worse”

Hx:  
~6–8/52 ↑ worry re “cognitive decline”  
Mild forgetfulness (names, keys), feels thinking slower esp late shifts. No actual med errors reported  
Marked health anxiety, googling early onset dementia / VSD / 22q11 etc. Wants “brain scan + full cardiac workup”  
Known congenital VSD dx childhood, told small, no surg. No HF hx, no arrhythmia, no cardiac meds, no anticoag  
Poor sleep 4–5h/night, ruminating about work + health. ↑ work stress, more nights, ↑ energy drinks  
Denies persistent low mood / anhedonia / SI. +excessive worry.  
No focal neuro sx: -ve HA, -ve visual/speech change, -ve weakness/numbness, -ve seizures, -ve falls  
No cardiac red flags: -ve CP, -ve sig palps, -ve syncope, -ve SOB/PND/orthopnoea/oedema  
Reports occasional light-headed on standing after long shifts

O/E:  
Looks anxious but well, orientated, coherent  
Obs: BP 118/72 HR 78 reg RR 14 SpO₂ 99% RA T 36.7 BMI ~23  
CVS: HS dual, soft systolic murmur LLSB, no oedema, JVP not ↑  
Resp: clear  
Neuro grossly non-focal. Informal cog screen WNL (reg/recall 3/3, clock ok). Anxiety during testing

Ix today:  
ECG: SR 76, normal axis, no ST-T changes, intervals WNL, no BBB/arrhythmia  
No path on site after hours

Impr:  
1) Health anxiety – prominent, focused on cognition + VSD. No evidence dementia / acute neuro event / psychosis today  
2) Subjective cognitive concerns likely 2° ↑ anxiety + poor sleep + baseline mild learning difficulties  
3) Congenital VSD – ?small, clinically stable, no HF, ECG reassuring. Due formal review  
4) Work stress / shift work

Plan:  
- Reassured re normal exam + ECG, no indication emergent CT/MRI or ED at present  
- Explained anxiety + sleep deprivation → ↓ concentration/memory; no red flags for early onset dementia today  
- Advised ↓ energy drinks / caffeine esp nights  
- Daytime GP f/up 1–2/52 (long appt) for:  
  → FBC, U&E, LFT, TSH, B12, folate, fasting glucose/HbA1c, lipids (S&N / QML)  
  → Consider MHTP + CBT for health anxiety  
  → Consider formal cognitive / psych assessment if ongoing concern (non-urgent)  
  → Cardiology referral for repeat echo + clarification VSD type/size, LV function, arrhythmia risk  
- Discussed 22q11 briefly – no obvious syndromic features; defer genetic counselling unless cardiology suggests / pt still very concerned  
- No meds started tonight – SSRI to be considered by usual GP if anxiety persists  
- Red flags/ED: new focal neuro sx, severe sudden HA, collapse/syncope, new CP, sig palps, SOB/PND/orthopnoea  
- Pt still asking re “brain scan tonight” – reiterated not indicated + limited after-hours resources. Appears somewhat reassured

RTC GP as above / UC/ED if worse.
