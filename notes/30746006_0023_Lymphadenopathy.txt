Telehealth video – review LN  

32F Aboriginal, remote community teacher – known cervical/submand LN  

PC: wants to “go through all the blood test and scan results about the swollen glands” + “make sure it’s not cancer”  

HPC  
LN neck still palpable, “maybe a bit smaller” last 1–2/52  
No fevers, no night sweats, wt stable, appetite ok  
Energy “up and down” – long days + recent viral  
Hx several URTI last 6–8/52 (kids sick)  
Prev dx acute CMV + Toxo (ID/GP)  
No sore throat now, no dental pain, no oral ulcers, no skin lesions, no new LN areas  
No dysphagia, no SOB, no voice change  
Very anxious, has been googling “swollen lymph nodes and lymphoma”, “I’m really scared this could be cancer”, asking re PET  

Meds: PRN paracetamol only. NKDA  

Telehealth obs (limited)  
Looks well, NAD, talking in full sentences, no resp distress  
Points to small mobile “beans” along ant cervical chain bilat – size not reliably assessed on video  

Ix reviewed (since last review 03/05/23 15/08/24 – updated)  
Bloods (~1/52 ago, remote clinic)  
- FBE: WCC now N (was mildly ↑), Hb/Plt N, film no atyp lymphs  
- ESR/CRP: previously mildly ↑ → now low-N  
- LFTs N (prior mild transaminitis resolved)  
- U&E N  
- LDH N  
- CMV serol: IgM falling, IgG +ve  
- Toxo serol: IgM ↓, IgG +ve  
→ pattern resolving infections, no red flags for haematol malignancy  

Neck USS (2/52 ago, regional)  
Mult bilat cerv LN, largest ~1.3 cm short axis, oval, fatty hilum preserved, N hilar flow, no necrosis/matting/mass  
Rpt: “Reactive lymphadenopathy, likely post-infective. No sonographic features suspicious for malignancy.”  

A  
1) Cervical/submand LN – subacute, improving, reactive post CMV/Toxo + recurrent URTI. No B sx, no rapid ↑, benign bloods + USS. Malignancy risk low currently  
2) Recent CMV + Toxoplasma – resolving, immunocompetent  
3) Recurrent viral URTI – occupational  
4) Health anxiety / illness anxiety – high concern re “cancer”, heavy Dr Google use  

P  
1) LN  
- Reassured: clinical + Ix c/w reactive LN, not currently c/f lymphoma  
- No abx, no further imaging (no PET/CT/biopsy at this stage)  
- Plan repeat FBE, ESR/CRP 6–8/52 if LN still palpable / change – will send form to local path closer to time  
- Consider rpt USS + ENT/haem referral if ↑ size, hard/fixed, new sites, B sx or abn bloods  

2) CMV/Toxo  
- No specific Rx needed  
- General advice re rest, food hygiene (brief)  

3) URTI  
- Symptomatic care only, vacc status to check next visit (flu/COVID)  

4) Health anxiety  
- Validated concerns, explained mismatch fear vs obj findings  
- Advised avoid excessive googling, suggested Healthdirect etc if reading  
- Rec longer appt (F2F if can get to clinic, or long telehealth) to focus on anxiety + possible psych / Aboriginal MH worker referral (Better Access)  
- Pt agreeable but still asking “are you sure it’s not lymphoma?” → reiterated red flags + plan  

Safety net  
- URGENT review/ED if rapid LN ↑ over days, severe pain, red/hot neck, high fever, dysphagia, SOB, systemically very unwell  
- Earlier GP review if ongoing ↑ over next 4–6/52, hard/fixed LN, night sweats, wt loss, persistent fevers  

F/up  
- Telehealth review ~6/52 or earlier PRN  
- Prefer in-person exam at nearest clinic when feasible for proper palpation  
- Asked to keep brief sx diary (fever, sweats, wt, LN changes)  

Time ~15 mins – multiple Q re cancer / “more tests” so limited time for full anxiety workup – to address next long appt.
