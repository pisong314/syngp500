Today focussed on infection + basic general health relevant to current problem  
Pt not fully happy but accepted compromise wants results “as soon as theyre back”  

Pt engagement  
Somewhat demanding repeatedly asking for abx + extensive bloods “why cant you just prescribe what Im asking for”  
Needed clear explanation of guideline based approach eventually agreeable  

Safety net  
Advised urgent ED if sudden ↑pain esp severe or waking from sleep high fever >38.5 rigors N/V ↑redness or dark/black skin scrotum difficulty passing urine or pain not settling with regular analgesia

Plan / F/U  
- Await urine NAAT MSU bloods will contact re abnormal or +STI  
- r/v 48–72h or earlier if deterioration can do telehealth for results if needed  
- Consider extending abx up to 3/52 or altering regimen if MSU suggests enteric organism  
- Suggest longer appt in coming wks for general health check lipids HbA1c hormones etc if still concerned  

Results pending: all Ix today first presentation so no prior trends to compare yet
