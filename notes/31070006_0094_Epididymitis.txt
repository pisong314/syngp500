Pt has read online incl NICE + Aust STI guidelines asking "could this be epididymo orchitis rather than just urethritis" and whether dual tx for GC/CT indicated

Impression / differentials  
Extensive discussion held re likely dx and serious pathology exclusion  
Main working dx  
1  Acute L epididymitis likely epididymo orchitis 2' STI (CT +/- GC) based on age sexual hx urethral discharge L epididymal tenderness absence of urinary tract RFs  
2  Urethritis likely STI related  

Alt dx discussed  
– Testicular torsion considered less likely given gradual onset preserved cremasteric reflex classic epididymal localisation no high riding testis however not 0 risk  
– Acute bacterial prostatitis less likely nil fever systemic sx prostate NT on DRE  
– UTI/pyelo less likely nil LUTS flank pain systemic features  
– Inguinal hernia torsion of appendix testis tumour trauma varicocele hydrocele also discussed as differentials currently not supported by hx/exam  

Explained to pt that while torsion unlikely based on current findings if sudden change in pain character or severity must treat as emergency  

Investigations ordered today  
Discussed risks/benefits of testing vs empiric tx alone pt keen for full STI screen and urine tests  
Consent obtained for each  
– First pass urine NAAT CT/NG  
– MSU M/C/S  
– Urethral swab for Gram stain + culture pt informed may be uncomfortable agreed to proceed  
– Urine dip not done bedside as sending MSU documented  

Management today  
Extensive discussion re eTG and Aust STI guidelines including need for empiric dual cover for GC/CT while awaiting results pros cons incl potential SEs abx stewardship pt verbalised understanding  

Abx  
1 Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM stat given in clinic with lignocaine  
   Explained purpose cover presumptive GC potential local site pain allergy risk incl anaphylaxis pt consented  
   Tolerated well nil immediate reaction observed ~15 min  

2 Doxycycline 100 mg PO BD x 14/7 script provided  
   Counselled re dosing with food full glass water remain upright 30 mins photosensitivity avoid excessive sun protect skin  
   Discussed evidence for 14 vs 21/7 course explained plan to start 14/7 and extend up to 3/52 if slow response in consultation with regular GP  
   Pt queried resistance patterns in GC and role of other agents answered in brief referencing current Aust STI guidelines  

Symptomatic  
– NSAIDs and paracetamol discussed for pain control eg ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food if nil GI/renal issues and paracetamol 1 g QID max 4 g/24h  
– Advise scrotal support supportive underwear rest avoid heavy lifting straining next few days  
– Ice packs intermittently wrapped cloth if helpful  

Sexual health counselling  
Detailed discussion re transmission risk need for partner notification and abstinence  
– Advise no sexual activity incl oral/anal until ≥7/7 after starting tx AND sx resolved AND partners treated  
– Advised to inform current partner and any sexual partners last 6/12 that he is being treated for presumed chlamydial/gonococcal infection and they should seek testing + tx  
– Emphasised consistent condom use going forward pt states "yeah I probably got a bit slack with that"  

Further testing  
Briefly discussed broader STI screen HIV syphilis hep B/C etc given time constraints tonight advised arrange via usual GP in booked appt pt agreeable  

Safety netting / red flags  
Given medico legal risk and pt interest spent signif time outlining warning signs  
Explained need to attend ED urgently if  
– sudden severe testicular pain esp different to current pain  
– rapid ↑ swelling redness of scrotum  
– fever ≥38 rigors feeling acutely unwell vomiting urinary retention  
– spreading perineal or scrotal redness black discolouration or pain out of keeping with exam ?Fournier  
– nil improvement or worsening over next 48–72h despite abx  

Pt able to repeat back key red flags in his own words "if the pain suddenly goes real bad or I get crook with a fever I go straight to emergency"  

Follow up  
As this is after hours and pt no regular GP locally  
– Advised F/U with usual GP or local GP of choice in 3–5/7 for r/v of sx and preliminary results and consider extending or altering abx based on NAAT/culture esp if non STI pathogen or resistant GC  
– Explained clinic may contact him by mobile re positive CT/NG results and for partner notification support consent obtained for phone/SMS contact  

Other discussions  
Pt asked re possibility of enteric organisms despite nil anal intercourse explained lower likelihood but can occur discussion re alternative regimens with enteric cover if poor response to current tx to be considered by GP or specialist  
Pt also asked about PSA or other prostatitis markers explained PSA not indicated in young man with acute infection sx and DRE not suggestive prostatitis  
He raised interest in baseline bloods lipids fasting glucose etc explained non urgent best done with regular GP in dedicated appt  

Written info  
Provided written info re epididymitis/urethritis and STI management Healthdirect style print out including when to seek urgent care documented pt received and read briefly in consult  

Pt understanding and consent  
Throughout consult checked understanding multiple times pt able to paraphrase dx likely cause tx plan and red flags  
Pt agrees with plan including abx regime investigations abstinence and GP f/u  
States "that all makes sense happy to go with that"

– Working dx L epididymo orchitis + urethritis likely STI related
