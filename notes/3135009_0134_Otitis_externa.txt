Swimming in local lake on weekends recently ?water quality  
New cheaper over ear hearing protection from hardware store last few wks ?irritant effect  

Diabetes context

Nil known foreign body or trauma other than cotton buds  

Pt specifically concerned re risk of “something serious” given diabetes asking for ENT ref

Investigations today  
Capillary BSL in rooms 8.9 mmol/L non fasting  
Given typical acute diffuse OE 1st episode in some time canal still patent no swab today  

(Prev results)  
Last HbA1c per pt ~7.5 ~8/12 ago – not in current Best Practice inbox will check old SN pathology  
Plan for new HbA1c lipids UEC LFT via Sullivan Nicolaides next diabetes r/v  

Assessment  
1 Acute diffuse otitis externa R ear 2° likely bacterial infection on background moisture occlusive ear muffs and underlying skin disease  
   Typical tragal tenderness erythematous oedematous canal scant exudate TM appears intact  
   T2DM = ↑ risk complications but currently nil red flags for necrotising OE  
   No severe deep disproportionate pain nil cranial nerve deficit afebrile systemically well canal still open so drops feasible  

2 T2DM suboptimally monitored control appears reasonable by Hx only  
   Needs formal metabolic review and updated labs  

3 Chronic skin disease psoriasis seborrhoeic dermatitis incl peri auricular involvement likely contributing to recurrent irritation of canal skin and barrier disruption  

Plan  

# Otitis externa R  
Sofradex ear drops (dexamethasone framycetin gramicidin)  
– 3 gtts into R ear TDS for 7/7  
– Lie with R ear up instil drops gentle tragal pumping remain in position few mins  

Analgesia  
– Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN max 4 g/24h  
– May add ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food PRN as no hx renal impairment or PUD reported  

Ear care  
Keep R ear dry avoid swimming for at least 1–2/52  
No ear syringing  
Avoid cotton buds and inserting objects into canal  
Try to minimise use of tight over ear muffs next week if must use keep as dry as poss short breaks wipe sweat  

Safety net esp given diabetes  
Advise urgent r/v or ED if  
– pain ↑ esp severe deep night pain or not settling with simple analgesia  
– new facial weakness difficulty swallowing hoarseness or other CN sx  
– onset fevers feeling systemically unwell  
– spreading redness swelling over pinna or surrounding skin  

Pt asked “Should I be worried about this turning into something serious with the diabetes”  
Reassured current findings mild–mod only explained above red flags and lower threshold for r/v in diabetics  

# Referral  
Discussed that straightforward acute OE usually managed in GP with topical therapy ENT not routinely required initially  
Agreed plan trial drops  
If not significantly improved or resolved in 7–10/7 or if recurrent episodes over next few mths → non urgent ENT ref for further assessment aural toilet  
Pt agreeable  

# Diabetes & comorbidities  
Brief discussion re importance of glycaemic control to ↓ infection risk  
Time limited today single standard consult focus on acute ear  
Plan dedicated longer diabetes r/v within next 4/52  
At that visit  
– check HbA1c lipids UEC LFT urine ACR via SNP or QML  
– foot check BP wt  
– review skin mgmt esp peri auricular psoriasis seb derm  

Admin / Billing  
Standard GP consult item 23 bulk billed  

Follow up  
R/V 5–7/7 to assess R ear response to Sofradex repeat otoscopy ensure TM clearly visible  
Earlier r/v or ED if red flags as above  

Pt behaviour  
Engaged asking re duration of ear drops driving work safety with analgesia possible ototoxicity allergy  
Advised cease drops and seek r/v if marked ↑ pain new rash around ear or systemic reaction  
Pt says will use drops as directed keep ear dry will attend f/u as planned  

(Recall)  
Add recall for diabetes review 3–4/52  HbA1c and metabolic bloods prior if possible
