Ear  
R pinna tragus very tender on light touch  
Canal oedematous erythematous moist whitish yellow debris  
TM only partly seen appears intact nil bulging nil obvious MEE  
Nil mastoid tend erythema  

L ear mild erythema scaling external canal conchal bowl c/w dermatitis canal patent TM intact  
Mild tragal tend only on deep palp  

Peri auricular skin mild scaling erythema post auricular folds bilat c/w seb/contact derm mix  
Nil cellulitis nil perichondritis nil regional LAD  
CN II–XII grossly intact  

A  
1 Acute diffuse otitis externa R>L uncomplicated  
   Pain tragal/pinna tend canal oedema debris no systemic features TM appears intact  
   Likely 2° moisture (swimming) + mechanical/chemical irritation (cotton buds tea tree oil) on background seb/contact derm  

2 Seborrhoeic + contact dermatitis peri auricular L canal mild flare  

3 Challenging consultation strong belief in internet advice preference for oral abx required prolonged expln but eventually on board with plan  

Diff dx considered  
- Otomycosis less likely – more itch expected fungal debris absent  
- AOM unlikely – nil TM bulge nil MEE pain localised to canal movement  
- Perichondritis/cellulitis – nil pinna erythema warmth systemic Sx  
- Necrotising OE – very low ? young nil DM nil immunosupp nil granulation tissue nil CN signs  

P  
1 Acute OE  
- Explained dx pathophys role of water + trauma irritants  
- Clarified oral abx not indicated for simple diffuse OE per guidelines discussed resistance side effects etc  
  Pt: "drops dont do anything" discussed high local conc with drops vs tabs  

Meds  
- Sofradex ear drops (dexamethasone 0.05% framycetin 0.5% gramicidin 0.005%)  
  3 gtts R ear TDS 7/7  
  May use L ear BD 3–5/7 if becomes painful provided no trauma or ?perforation  
  Advised stop and seek r/v if sudden marked ↓hearing bloody d/c trauma etc  

- Analgesia  
  Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24h)  
  +/- ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food if nil contraindns  

Ear care  
- Keep ears dry during tx + ~2/52 after  
  Cotton wool with Vaseline or ear plug in shower  
  Avoid swimming till resolved  
- Demonstrated drop technique lie with affected ear up instil drops pump tragus stay few mins  
- Strict avoid cotton buds pins tea tree oil or other irritant drops  
  Explained likely contributing factors pt still a bit sceptical  

Safety net  
- Red flags for urgent r/v or ED  
  ↑pain unrelenting despite drops fevers feeling very unwell spreading redness/swelling pinna face new facial wkns severe headache mastoid tend sudden marked ↓hearing  

- If not clearly improving by 3–4/7 or not settled by 7–10/7 book R/V may need aural toilet ear wick swab  

2 Seb/contact derm  
- Brief discussion only time limited  
- Adv resume ketoconazole shampoo 2% BIW scalp and around external ear skin (not into canal)  
- Avoid known irritants nickel jewellery perfumed hair products  
- Plan longer appt 20 min in ~2–4/52 for chronic derm mx ± mild topical steroid peri auricular skin  
  Pt reluctant "no time to keep coming back" but will consider once OE beter  

Ix  
- Nil immediate ix indicated uncomplicated acute OE in young otherwise well pt  
- If recurrent or >3/12 sx will consider ear swab + ENT ref  

F/U  
- R/V 5–7/7 if not improving sooner if worse or red flags  
- Separate longer derm appt suggested reception asked to flag though pt unsure if will book
