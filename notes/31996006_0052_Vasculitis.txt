72F FU abdo pain HCV cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis/CKD/PMR  

4–5/7 central abdo → peri-umb + RIF ache 4–5/10 ± cramp post larger meals  
+ mild N no V  
Stools slightly looser x3/7 still formed 1–2/d, no PR blood, no melaena  
No urinary sx, no flank pain  
No fevers/rigors/NS, no wt loss, appetite ↓ a bit but eating  
On pred 7.5 mane + MMF 500 bd + esomep 20, perindopril 5, atorva 20, Ca/VitD, PRN panadol  
NKDA  
CKD 3b (eGFR ~32)  
Vasculitis clinically quiet (joints/purpura settled)  
Pt worried re “mesenteric vasculitis / intestinal ischaemia” and “kidneys acting up”  

O/E  
Looks well NAD  
BP 136/74 HR 80 RR 16 T 36.7 SpO2 98% RA BMI 27  
Abdo soft, mildly tender peri-umb + RIF, no guard/rebound, no masses, BS + slightly ↑  
Murphy -ve, no RUQ, no CVA tenderness  
No new rash/purpura seen  

Imp  
1) Subacute abdo pain – mild-mod, stable, non-peritonitic, no red flags today  
   ?med-related gastritis/dyspepsia (steroids/MMF)  
   ?viral/simple gastro / non-specific colitis  
   ?early diverticular / functional  
   Mesenteric vasculitis / ischaemia less likely (pain not severe, no systemic sx, benign exam) but needs close watch given background  
   Biliary/pancreas/renal colic less likely clinically  
2) HCV-assoc cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis – appears quiescent on low-dose pred + MMF  
3) CKD 3b – stable hx, avoid nephrotoxins  
4) PMR – stable  

Plan  
– Discussed ED vs GP w/up; pt prefers GP, understands risk  
– Path today (S&N): FBC, UEC/eGFR, LFTs, CRP, ESR, amylase, lipase  
– Urine dip in rooms: no blood, nitrite -ve, only trace prot ~baseline CKD  
– Stool FOB x3 if sx >1/52 or any PR blood  
– abdo USS booked (non-urgent ≤1/52) – hepatobiliary/kidneys/aorta/bowel wall  
– If ↑CRP/ESR, LFT derange, ↑lipase, ↓Hb or sx ↑ → ED for CT abdo (contrast decision in hosp re CKD)  
– Meds: cont pred/MMF/esomep/perind/atorva; panadol PRN; avoid NSAIDs  
– Diet: smaller meals, cut back fizzy drinks (unlikely main cause but ok to trial)  
– Red flag advice: ED/000 if sudden severe/worsening pain, pain out of proportion, V, PR blood/melaena, fevers/rigors, CP/SOB, syncope, can’t keep fluids down  
– Will send copy + results to rheum if any concern re flare  

F/up 3–4/7 with results or earlier if worse
