79F known pt. RLL entropion f/up (chronic). “Eye irritation”  

S:  
R eye gritty/irritated “for ages”, worse few wks. ↑watering, mild red, worse wind/night. Wakes with eye “stuck + sore”.  
- No pus, no photophobia, no sig ↓vision, no severe pain, no trauma, no CLs  
Non-adherent: ran out of lubricant drops “weeks ago”, not using tape at night (“too fiddly”).  
Hx: RLL involutional entropion dx >12/12. Ophth recommended surgery – pt cancelled twice (“buses too hard”, “didn’t feel that bad”).  
Allergies: NKDA  

Prev exam (GP 6/12 ago – copied fwd):  
RLL entropion, lashes on cornea, mild conjunctival injection, punctate staining, no ulcer. L eye NAD.  

O:  
Phone only – no exam today  
Pt reports vision same as baseline, can read paper w glasses. Says eye “a bit red inside”, lashes poking in. No lid swelling, no discharge per pt.  
Red flag screen -ve: no acute ↓vision, no flashes/curtain, no severe pain, no systemic sx.  

A:  
1) R lower lid entropion – chronic, symptomatic, likely progression. Recurrent irritation, risk recurrent corneal abrasion  
2) Non-adherence to conservative Rx + missed ophth appts → ongoing sx  

P:  
- Lubricant drops restarted:  
  * CMC 0.5% eye drops (PF if >4/day) 1–2 gtt R eye QID + PRN (PBS OTC – script given anyway)  
- Warm compresses bd if able  
- Re-discussed taping RLL overnight to evert lid. Pt “might try” but likely poor adherence  
- Re-refer ophth public clinic for entropion repair (new referral today – avoid city if possible though likely tertiary). Emphasised risk corneal damage, potential vision loss if no surgery  
- Ask PN to call in ~1/52 to:  
  * check she got drops + using  
  * remind re ophth appt / transport options (community transport etc)  

Safety net:  
- URGENT review/ED if sudden ↓vision, severe pain, marked ↑redness/swelling, pus, halos/marked photophobia  
- Otherwise f2f GP review 2–3/52 for VA + slit lamp/fluorescein if available + check ophth appt booked  

Other:  
- Mentioned knee stiffness – deferred, needs separate std f2f appt  

Time: ~12 min tel
