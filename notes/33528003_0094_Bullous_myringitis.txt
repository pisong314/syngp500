Pain beter by day 4–5 then over last 2/7  
- persistent dull ache L ear intermittent sharp twinges "like little stabs"  
- ↓ hearing L "like I’m underwater"  
- occasional brief high pitched tinnitus L  
- nil otorrhoea nil vertigo nil imbalance nil facial weakness  
- nil fevers rigors systemic sx  
Had mild nasal congestion last wk now resolved  

Pt worried infection "hasn’t cleared" and if loud music at work "might pop something"  
Works in busy shopping centre retail near speakers a lot finds it hard to take time off though can swap shifts if really unwell  

Also mentions feeling "abit tired all the time" but happy to leave that for another longer appt

Impression  
1 Bullous myringitis L ear mild likely post recent AOM now resolving  
   Systemically well nil red flags nil mastoiditis nil facial nerve involvement  
2 Subjective ↓ hearing L likely transient conductive element 2° inflammation / recent effusion  
   No clinical features of sudden SNHL today  
3 Mild non specific fatigue not addressed in detail today  

Resource / access considerations  
Pt working retail in large centre limited ability to take time off or travel to regional ENT on short notice  
Local public ENT wait likely several mths telehealth ENT via hospital an option if persistent sx  
No immediate access to on site audiometry today would need external referral (Qld Hearing / private audiology) cost may be an issue if not covered  

Plan  

# Bullous myringitis / ear pain  
Explained dx natural hx  
Blisters on TM often painful but usually settle over 1–2 wks hearing can lag 1–3/52  
Given she already completed 7/7 abx afebrile exam reassuring → conservative mgmt  

Analgesia  
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
- Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN wf if tolerating GI no known contraindications  
Can alternate as needed within dose limits  

Topical  
- Avoid inserting anything into ear canal no cotton buds  
- Avoid OTC ear drops for now as if small perf develops some drops ototoxic  

Advice  
- Keep ear dry avoid swimming for ~2/52 careful in shower  
- Avoid very loud noise / standing right by speakers at work if poss reassured that usual shop background music unlikely to "pop" ear  
- Avoid flying until pain and hearing improved if she can rebook flights if any  

Abx  
- No further abx today recent adequate course + resolving picture  
- Explained extra abx now unlikely to help may ↑side effects pt happy with this  

Investigations  
None today as exam reassuring and likely post infective  
Discussed options if not improving  
- Audiometry via local audiology (out of pocket ~ variable) vs public hearing clinic wait longer  
- If persistent or recurrent → ENT ref  
Not ordered today as pt prefers to observe first given work/time constraints  

Safety net  
Urgent r/v GP or ED if  
- ↑severe pain not settling with simple analgesia  
- Fever feeling systemically crook  
- New discharge esp bloody or purulent  
- Sudden marked drop in hearing new vertigo imbalance facial weakness severe headache  

# Hearing concern  
Reassured permanent damage unlikely based on current exam  
Emphasised need for f/u to confirm recovery  
If at f/u still sig ↓hearing or abnormal exam →  
- formal audiometry  
- ENT ref (public clinic vs private depending on wait times cost transport)  

# Fatigue  
Acknowledged ongoing tiredness pt says "just wiped out by the end of the day"  
Not explored fully today due to time and ear focus  
Suggested longer appt in next few wks for full workup  
Likely to include hx sleep mood diet menstrual pattern screen for depn etc and bloods eg FBC U&E LFT TFT ferritin B12 folate via QML or SNP depending on pt preference  
Not ordered today to avoid unnecessary time off work for path when main issue ear  

Follow up  
- GP r/v 5–7/7 to reassess L ear + hearing earlier if any deterioration  
- If well and sx resolving can stretch to 2/52 per pt work roster though advised sooner beter  
Note for self: consider audiology / ENT if no improvement by then  

Pt engaged asked good qs re "how long till my hearing is back" and "could this be permanent"  
Understands plan agrees to watchful waiting + analgesia and to seek help if worse
