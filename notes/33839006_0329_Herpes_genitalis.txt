   - Needs full STI screen counselling contraception and cervical screening at future longer appt  

2 Request "blood test check everything"  
   - Mainly anxiety re herpes being in blood wanting proof of cure  
   - Appropriate to offer STI screen + basic health screen  
   - HSV serology not ordered not useful to check cure discussed  

Plan  

# Genital herpes  
Explained in simple terms via daughter  
Herpes common lifelong virus stays in body meds help attacks get shorter and less frequent over time not removed  
Given written HSV info sheet (English) advised can use phone interpreter NAATI next visit rather than only daughter  

Meds  
- Start valaciclovir 500mg PO mane daily suppressive ongoing  
  Discussed trial 6–12/12 then consider stop to see recurrence pattern  
  If breakthrough episodes may ↑ to 500mg BD temporarily to be r/v  
- If stops suppression later to start meds ASAP at tingling/itch or lesions  

Counselling  
- Avoid sex during outbreaks or prodromal tingling  
- Encourage consistent condom use explains ↓ not 0 transmission risk  
- Avoid touching lesions then eyes wash hands if contact  
- Briefly discussed future pregnancy if becomes preg to inform GP/OB early due to HSV and options for meds late preg
