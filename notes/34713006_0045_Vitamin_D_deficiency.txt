RACF review – weakness / vit D / CKD4  

82F long-term RACF. Known vit D def, rickets, CKD4 (eGFR ~22 per nephro 6/12 ago).  

CC: “bit wobbly on my pins lately” x months, worse few wks. Trouble getting out of low chair/bed, ↑ help for shower/transfers. Near falls with 4WW, no definite fall. “Don’t want to be a bother”.  
Aches thighs/hips esp after standing with physio, ~3/10 when asked, staff say more. No focal back pain, no radicular sx. No bowel/bladder change, no fevers/weight loss/N/S.  

Meds (per chart – partial):  
- Colecalciferol 1000 IU mane (often missed)  
- CaCO3 600 + vit D 400 IU BD (adherence ?).  
- Amlodipine 5 mg mane  
- Perindopril 4 mg mane  
- Frusemide 20 mg mane  
- Paracetamol 1 g TDS PRN (usually nocte)  
NKDA  

O/E (today RN obs): BP 132/68 HR 74 reg RR 16 SpO2 97% RA T 36.6  
Thin elderly, NAD in chair.  
Gait w 4WW + standby: slow, wide-ish base, hesitant turns. Needs arms to push up, multiple attempts.  
Power: prox ↓ LL>UL – hip flex ~3+/5, knees 4/5, distal 5/5. Shoulders ~4-/5. Tone nl, reflexes ↓ but present, sensation grossly intact. No spinal tenderness. Mild diffuse ache over prox femurs.  

A:  
1) Proximal muscle weakness – likely multifactorial → vit D def/osteomalacia + deconditioning, RACF, ↓ sun. ↑ falls risk. Neuro exam non-focal, no red flags for cord/CVA/neuropathy.  
2) Vit D deficiency (mod–severe, last 25-OH 24 nmol/L 3/12 ago) – undertreated + poor adherence.  
3) CKD4 – needs updated UEC/eGFR, Ca/PO4/PTH before any big vit D changes. Nephrology previously advised avoid mega-dose, consider active vit D if PTH ↑.  
4) Rickets/osteomalacia – chronic deformity, ?active component now.  

P:  
Ix – forms left for mobile phleb/RN (within 1/52):  
- 25-OH vit D  
- UEC, eGFR  
- Corrected Ca, PO4, ALP  
- PTH  
- FBC, CRP  

Meds:  
- ↑ colecalciferol to 4000 IU PO mane x 8/52 (nursing admin – chart updated) → then plan ↓ to 1000–2000 IU mane maint once vit D ≥50 + nephrology happy. Avoid 300,000 IU mega-dose given age/falls/CKD.  
- Continue CaCO3 + vit D combo for now – RN to check actual doses given vs chart.  
- Ask facility to use standard milk rather than “skinny one” if dietitian ok – for Ca intake.  

Falls / mobility:  
- Continue 4WW + supervised ambulation.  
- Physio review requested – focus prox strength + safe transfers.  
- RN to document any falls/near falls and notify GP.  

Letters/comm:  
- Plan note/letter to nephrologist once bloods back re: need for calcitriol vs ongoing colecalciferol (esp if PTH ↑ / Ca/PO4 borderline).  
- Family/EPOA to be updated once results back (note in file).  

F/U:  
- Review 2–3/52 (or earlier if abn bloods) – check Ix, reassess strength/falls risk, finalise vit D plan / consider calcitriol / nephro re-referral.  
- Longer review then for chronic R shoulder pain (“from the old nursing days”) – deferred today due time.
