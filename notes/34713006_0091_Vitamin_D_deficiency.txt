Told level ~15 nmol/L or lower ?osteomalacia defective bone mineralisation  
Since then reading Healthy Bones Aust NICE etc quite well informed

Pt queries need for high dose colecalciferol eg 50000 IU or calcitriol concerned re falls risk with megadoses in older pts does not want harm BMD

Impression / dx  
1 Vit D deficiency suspected mod–severe SNOMED 34713006  
   Clin picture fits vit D def with bone pain prox myopathy high risk factors dark skin low sun low Ca overweight previous low level per pt but unconfirmed today  
   Likely early osteomalacia 2° vit D def but no red flags for sinister bone pathology atm  
2 Low dietary Ca intake contrib to impaired bone mineralisation  
3 Will need staged bone health workup DEXA etc once vit D corrected time limited consult today  

Plan  

Ix ordered today (local lab)  
- 25-OH vit D  
- CMP U&E LFT  
- Corrected Ca PO₄ ALP  
- PTH  
- FBC  
- Coeliac screen tTG IgA total IgA  

Discussed need to confirm level here before high dose or calcitriol due to Medicare rules etc pt agreed  

Vit D mgmt  
- Start colecalciferol 1000 IU PO daily OTC from today empiric safe dose while awaiting results will not mask severe def  
- If 25-OH vit D <30 nmol/L once results back plan ↑ dose to 3000–5000 IU daily for 6–12/52 then maint 1000–2000 IU daily per eTG repeat level ~3/12  
- Avoid single megadose regimens 300000–500000 IU given evidence ↑falls esp older pts not indicated here good adherence expected  
- Calcitriol discussed usually for CKD or specific vit D metabolism disorders not first line for her  

Calcium & lifestyle  
- Aim total Ca ~1000 mg/day  
- Advised Ca fortified plant milks check label ~300 mg/serve plus tofu set with Ca almonds tahini leafy greens  
- May need Ca supp ~500–600 mg elemental daily if diet inadequate to finalise after diet recall dietitian input at later r/v  
- Brief sun exposure advice for her skin type and remote Aust setting short regular mid morning or mid afternoon exposure to face arms hands most days avoid sunburn  
- Encouraged gentle WB exercise eg walking light resistance avoid sudden high impact until sx improve  

Safety net  
Pt advised to seek urgent r/v or ED if severe focal bone pain night pain waking from sleep neuro sx bowel/bladder change or any low impact #  
If bloods show unexpected abnorm eg markedly ↑ALP abn Ca/PO₄ LFTs or renal will consider imaging and/or specialist ref  

F/U  
- R/V ~2/52 or earlier once results avail phone consult ok given remote location  
  → review results adjust vit D dose as above  
  → formal Ca intake review consider Ca supp  
- Longer appt later once vit D stable for broader bone health assessment fracture risk DEXA consideration and routine preventive care cervical screen lipids etc  
- Asked pt to obtain copy of previous Syd pathology for comparison  

Billing  
Bulk billed MBS item 23 standard consult ~15 min focus vit D / bone health
