72F review  

Reason: “quick review and some bloods” + Vit D/osteoporosis f/u  
Arrived with long list “while I’m here” – negotiated today = bones + “check-up bloods” only. Asked to book long appt for rest.

Hx  
Vit D def / osteoporosis  
- Known Vit D def last yr on DEXA workup. Last Vit D ~12/12 ago 32 nmol/L (was lower before per pt). DEXA FN T-score -2.7. Prev L1 crush # ~3 yrs ago (low trauma).  
- On alendronate 70 mg weekly + self-start Ca/Vit D + OTC Vit D 1000 IU “when I remember”. Adherence patchy.  
- Feels “fine really, just creaky with age”. No bone pain, no prox muscle weakness, no recent falls/#. Avoids sun “don’t want skin cancer”. ↓ dairy last 6–12/12. No steroids / no hx liver/renal / no coeliac/IBD sx.  

“Check-up bloods”  
- Wants “full blood check to make sure everything’s okay”. No wt loss, no B sx, no specific c/o.  

Other issues raised today but deferred (time)  
- R shoulder ache hanging washing (no red flags volunteered)  
- “Funny turn” 3/12 ago – brief lightheaded on standing in garden, no LOC, no CP, no focal neuro, self-resolved  
- Toenail fungus L hallux  
- Dry eyes, scalp “little bumps”, reflux, supplement Qs (multivit vs fish oil etc)  
Advised need long appt 20–30 min next 2–4/52, asked to prioritise top 2–3. Pt kept saying “oh and another thing” → redirected.

Exam  
BP 132/74 HR 74 reg SpO2 98% RA afeb BMI 25  
Looks well. Gait normal. Mild thoracic kyphosis, no spinal or long bone tenderness, rises from chair unaided, prox power 5/5. No focal neuro deficit.  

Ix ordered today  
- 25-OH Vit D  
- CMP (U&E, LFT, Ca, PO4, ALP)  
- FBC, lipids, HbA1c (age-appropriate + pt request)  
DEXA repeat next yr (last ~12/12 ago) – reminder set (was T-score -2.7 FN).  

A  
1) Vit D deficiency – likely persistent, mild–mod (last 32 nmol/L). Ongoing RFs: age >70, ↓ sun, ↓ dairy, inconsistent supps, osteoporosis + prior fragility #. Asx.  
2) Osteoporosis – established, high # risk (age + prev vertebral #). On alendronate, adherence fair but needs reinforcing.  
3) Multiple deferred minor issues – need structured long review, not safe to cram into std consult.  

P  
Vit D / osteoporosis  
- Simplify regimen: cease multiple OTC Ca/Vit D products to ↓ confusion.  
- Start colecalciferol 1000 IU daily (script + repeats). Flag to ↑ to 2000 IU if level remains <50 nmol/L.  
- Encourage dietary Ca (aim ~1200 mg/d from food; will reassess need for separate Ca tab once diet clarified – avoid duplicate combo preps).  
- Reinforce alendronate 70 mg weekly: take on waking with full glass water, stay upright 30 min, no food/other meds during that time.  
- Basic falls prevention advice given; more detailed review next long appt.  

Monitoring plan (pending results)  
- If Vit D <30 → consider higher dose 3000–5000 IU od x ~8/52 then step down to 1000–2000 IU od, recheck ~3/12.  
- If 30–49 → continue/adjust 1000–2000 IU od, recheck ~6/12.  
- Once ≥50 and stable → no frequent repeats unless change in RFs.  
- CMP to ensure normal Ca/renal before any high-dose regimen.  
- FBC, lipids, HbA1c as baseline “check-up” – manage per results (lipids prev high, on atorva 20 mg nocte – no change today).  

Other issues  
- Documented list for next visit: R shoulder pain, “funny turn”, reflux, toenail fungus, dry eyes, scalp lesions, supplement Qs.  
- Pt to book long appt 2–3/52 for results + to work through list (aim ≥2–3 issues only).  

F/U  
- Long review 2–3/52: bloods, adjust Vit D dose, osteoporosis/falls review, then shoulder/“funny turn”/reflux if time.  
- Earlier PRN if new bone pain, muscle weakness, fall/#, or any concerning sx.
