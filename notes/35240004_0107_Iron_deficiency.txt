GP Reg: Dr ___  
Supervisor: Dr ___  

Reason for call  
Pt phoned re leg pain on walking "backs of my legs seize up"  

ID  
32yo F Anglo-Australian primary school teacher known iron deficiency on file  

Subjective  

# Leg pain / exertional sx  
- Pain: "crampy heavy" ache in both calves ± thighs  
- Onset: unclear pt alternates btwn "last week" vs "a few months" poor historian  
- Pattern: after few mins walking eg train→school eases w rest after few mins nil nocturnal pain  
- Bilateral R>L  
- Assoc: marked fatigue feels "wiped out" by mid arvo ↑SOB on stairs  
- Nil chest pain nil palps nil presyncope or syncope  
- Nil back pain bowel or bladder change nil paraesthesia or weakness reported  
- Pt theories re cheap flat shoes and aircon "cold feet"  
- No hx PVD DM smoking DVT/PE  

Overall sounds more like ↓exercise tolerance from anaemia / deconditioning rather than true vascular claudication esp given age RF profile and bilateral symetrical sx  

# Iron deficiency / ?IDA  
Known iron deficiency previously on oral iron but stopped  
- Old results in EMR (approx 4–5/12 ago)  
  - Hb 104 g/L MCV 72 fL  
  - Ferritin 7 mcg/L  
  - WCC Plts U&E LFTs all normal at that time  
- Sx now  
  - Fatigue "knackered by 3pm"  
  - ↓exercise tolerance mild exertional SOB  
  - Occ headaches  
  - Mild pagophagia "craving ice abit"  
- Menstrual hx  
  - Heavy menses first 2–3d changing tampons ~hourly  
  - Cycle 28–32d duration 6–7d  
  - Nil IMB nil PCB  
  - No hormonal contraception nil known fibroids  
- Diet  
  - Often skips meals on busy school days  
  - Chicken couple times/wk minimal red meat some days mainly toast + coffee  
  - Not vego  
- GI  
  - Nil abdo pain change in bowel habit PR bleed melaena haematemesis  
  - Nil known coeliac  
- Preg  
  - Denies current preg LMP ~3 wks ago  
  - Not actively TTC but maybe in 1–2yrs  

PMHx  
- Iron deficiency / probable IDA incomplete workup  
- Nil CKD IBD coeliac malignancy heart dz  
- Nil surgery  

Meds  
- Not currently on regular meds  
- Previously iron tabs unsure brand dose stopped due to GI upset "made my tummy weird"  
- Occasional Nurofen  

Allergies  
- Denies known drug allergies unsure details of any past reactions  

FHx  
- Mother "low iron" heavy periods  
- Nil premature vascular dz nil bowel Ca known  

SHx  
- Non smoker  
- Alcohol 1–2 std drinks on w/ends  
- Lives w partner works FT teacher time poor for appts some concern re time off work but no major $ barriers  

Behaviour / reliability  
- Poor historian inconsist timelines and med hx needs Qs rephrased  

Objective (telephone only)  
- Gen: speaking full sentences on phone alert coherant  
- No audible SOB cough or wheeze  
- Unable to visually inspect legs nil vitals available  

Recent results – EMR  
- As above Hb 104 g/L MCV 72 fL ferritin 7 mcg/L approx 4–5/12 ago  
- No more recent FBC U&E LFT in system  

Assessment  

1. Exertional bilateral calf pain fatigue SOB on exertion  
   - Appears most likely 2° ↓exercise tolerance from iron-deficiency anaemia ± deconditioning  
   - True PAD less likely given age no RFs bilat sx resolution w short rest nil rest pain nil ulcers  
   - Still need to keep other causes in mind eg MSK biomechanical from footwear neurogenic claudication less likely given nil back pain neuro sx but would need in-person exam if persists  

2. Iron deficiency with likely IDA  
   - Known microcytic anaemia ferritin 7 previously  
   - Poor adherence to oral iron heavy menstrual bleeding + suboptimal dietary iron likely main contributors  
   - Need repeat FBC iron studies and screen for other causes esp coeliac if persistent  

3. Heavy menstrual bleeding  
   - Probable major driver of iron loss  
   - Not fully assessed today due to phone format and time  
   - Will need dedicated F2F appt to explore options eg COCP LNG-IUD tranexamic etc and consider pelvic US and possible gynae ref  

Plan  

Investigations – to be done this wk  
Forms to be sent to local SNP  
- FBC  
- Iron studies (ferritin transferrin sat serum iron TIBC)  
- CRP  
- Coeliac serology (total IgA tTG-IgA)  
- CMP (U&E LFTs) if not done in last 12/12 (none visible)  
- β-hCG urine or serum at collection as precaution pre ongoing iron therapy ± future IV iron  

Management – iron deficiency / IDA  
- Restart oral iron  
  - Rx: Ferro-grad C 325 mg (105 mg elemental Fe + vit C) 1 tab PO mane  
  - PBS script sent to eRx  
  - Advised take away from tea coffee dairy where poss may take w small amt food if GI upset  
  - Warned black stools poss constipation nausea  
  - If poorly tolerated daily can trial alternate days and let us know  
  - Plan continue at least 3/12 after Hb normal then further 3/12 to replenish stores total ~3–6/12 depending results  

Management – leg sx  
- Explained likely related to anaemia ↓O2 carrying capacity → fatigue calf discomfort on exertion  
- For now focus on correcting iron  
- Safety net  
  - Seek urgent r/v ED if sudden severe leg pain unilateral swelling erythema chest pain sig SOB or unable to weight bear  
  - If new rest pain colour change ulcers or neuro deficits needs prompt F2F for vascular neuro MSK exam  

Heavy menses / underlying cause  
- Briefly discussed HMB as main likely source of iron loss  
- Pt keen to discuss options but limited time today  
- Plan F2F standard appt 15–20min in next 2–4/52 to  
  - Take detailed gynae hx  
  - Check BP BMI general exam pelvic exam if appropriate  
  - Discuss medical mgmt options for HMB and contraception esp given possible preg in next 1–2yrs  
  - Consider pelvic US and gynae ref depending on findings and bloods  

Lifestyle / diet  
- Encouraged ↑dietary iron (lean red meat legumes leafy greens iron fortified cereal) + vit C foods  
- Suggested planning simple iron rich snacks for school days to avoid skipping meals  

Follow up  
- Pt to attend pathology within 1 wk  
- Phone r/v 2/52 to discuss results tolerance of iron reassess leg sx  
- F2F appt 2–4/52 for HMB and contraception discussion as above  
- Earlier r/v PRN if sx worsen  

Time  
- 13 min telehealth consult  

Plan discussed w pt who agreed

Supervisor addendum  

[Added by Dr ___ (Supervisor) 22/11/25 17:10]  

Reviewed case w registrar after consult  
Agree likely IDA from heavy menses and suboptimal intake with exertional sx incl calf discomfort appearing 2° anaemia rather than PAD given age RFs pattern  
Agree with ordering FBC iron studies CRP coeliac serology and CMP via SNP and restarting Ferro-grad C  

Would emphasise at next F2F need for BP check and cardiovascular risk screen even though PAD unlikely  
If leg sx persist despite correction of Hb/ferritin or any unilateral features develop would suggest in-person exam incl pulses ABPI if concern persists and consider Doppler US  

Management plan appropriate
