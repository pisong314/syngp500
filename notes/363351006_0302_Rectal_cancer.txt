Assessment  
1 Subacute cough 2–3/52 in 72yo ex smoker hx rectal Ca  
   – Clinically stable afebrile sats ok chest exam only faint bibasal crackles  
   – Ddx viral or atyp LRTI vs early pneumonia vs GORD related cough vs Ca related incl lung mets  
2 Rectal Ca post tx surveillance overdue poor attendance unclear current staging  
   – No clinical features bowel obstruction or ascites today mild wt ↓ altered bowel habit needs imaging  
3 Non adherence to f/u + meds major issue impacting Ca surveillance  

Plan  
Resp / cough  
– CXR as above to r/o infectn mass effusion mets  
– Bloods as above baseline and ?inflam  
– Symptomatic cough mix simple linctus OTC discussed  
– Continue paracetamol PRN max 4g/24h  

Rectal Ca / surveillance  
– CT CAP w contrast reissued marked “overdue surveillance new cough pls prioritise”  
– Nurse to assist pt to book CT before leaving today aim local imaging first then Wagga if needed  
– Will send updated summary + results to onc team Wagga once CXR/CT back  

Adherence / supports  
– Discussed pattern of missed appts openly
