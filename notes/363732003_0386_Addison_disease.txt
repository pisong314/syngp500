42F  

Reason for visit  
C/O dark patches on skin and in mouth over last few mths known Addison disease autoimmune polyglandular syndrome partial hypopituitarism  

History of presenting complaint  
Pt is a 42-year-old woman who attends today re progressive darkening of skin and oral mucosa over approx 3–4/12  
Reports gradual ↑pigmentation over dorsal hands knuckles elbows palmar creases and around old scars on shins  
Also notes brown macular patches on gums and inside cheeks says people at work keep asking if she has been on holidays  
Denies new soaps creams perfumes tanning products or recent significant sunburn  
Queries if herbal teas instead of coffee or working under fluorescent lights all day could be contributing  

Fatigue mildly ↑ over same period though attributes largely to work stress and school-age children  
Appetite satisfactory weight stable clothes fit the same  
Nil N/V/D nil abdo pain  
Nil dizziness on standing nil syncope nil confusion or presyncope  
Nil recent febrile illness surgery major stressor or trauma  

States adherence to meds excellent taking hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as prescribed for ~2yrs under endocrinology care  
No recent stress dosing required >6/12  
Nil episodes suggestive of adrenal crisis historically  

Reports ↑salt craving compared with baseline over past few mths  
Nil leg swelling nil SOB  
Thirst and urination unchanged nil polyuria nil polydipsia nil visual change  
Nil new headaches  
No significant change in menopausal type symptoms occasional mild hot flushes as previously attributed to hypogonadism from hypopituitarism  

She is concerned this may mean her Addison disease is getting worse or that her doses need changing asks if this is a side effect of treatment

Recent results / trends  
Last UEC/LFT 8/12 ago Na 137 K 4.2 Cr 72 eGFR >90 all WNL  
TSH 1.8 FT4 WNL on current thyroxine 7/12 ago  
DEXA ~2 yrs ago reported normal BMD per old letter exact T scores not in file  

Assessment  
1 Primary adrenal insufficiency Addison disease with progressive cutaneous and oral mucosal hyperpigmentation  
   – Clinical picture consistent with chronic ↑ACTH driving pigmentation despite replacement therapy  
   – Currently haemodynamically stable nil features of acute adrenal crisis  
   – Mild asymptomatic postural drop and ↑salt craving raise ?under-replacement esp mineralocorticoid though vitals overall acceptable and similar to prior readings in file  
   – Need to exclude electrolyte disturbance hyponatraemia hyperkalaemia and assess adequacy of current replacement prior to endo r/v  

2 Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and partial hypopituitarism known  
   – On multiple hormone replacements appears adherent  
   – Thyroid replacement not to be altered in primary care today given background adrenal insufficiency and complexity defer dose adjustments to endo  

3 Long term glucocorticoid therapy bone and metabolic risk  
   – DEXA was normal ~2 yrs ago due for repeat within 1–3 yrs depending on endo guidance  
   – Not main focus today will address at longer chronic disease r/v  

Plan  
Addison disease / pigmentation  
Reassured pt that ↑pigmentation is a recognised manifestation of Addison disease and usually reflects ACTH levels rather than medication toxicity  
Explained that on its own it does not equate to crisis but can indicate the need to reassess dosing esp fludrocortisone  

Investigations ordered today  
– UEC CMP incl Na K urea Cr Ca glucose  
– FBC CRP to screen for intercurrent illness or inflammatory process  
– Morning pre dose cortisol and ACTH ordered timed for upcoming endo appt note that interpretation on replacement is specialist issue results to be forwarded  
– Plasma renin and aldosterone as per previous endo protocol to assess mineralocorticoid adequacy  

Meds  
– Continue current doses for now  
   Hydrocortisone 10 mg mane 5 mg mid–pm  
   Fludrocortisone 100 microg mane  
   Levothyroxine 100 microg mane  
   HRT unchanged  
– Advised not to self adjust baseline doses prior to endo r/v except as per sick day rules  
– Brief refresher sick day management  
   For febrile illness significant infection or surgery double usual hydrocortisone dose e.g. 10 mg TDS and seek prompt medical r/v  
   If vomiting and unable to retain tablets advised to use emergency hydrocortisone injection kit if confident and call ambulance or attend ED  

Education safety net  
Explained herbal teas and fluorescent lighting not causative for this pattern of pigmentation more likely disease related  
Confirmed she has MedicAlert bracelet and wallet card she wears bracelet most of time encouraged daily use  
Red flags for adrenal crisis discussed nausea vomiting severe abdo or flank pain profuse diarrhoea worsening dizziness or collapse confusion fever advised immediate ED if occurs  
Pt verbalised understanding  

Comorbidities / preventive  
Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome  
– Will send copy of this note and pathology to treating endocrinologist for r/v in ~5/52 suggested she bring symptom list and today’s results  
Bone health  
– Noted need to consider repeat DEXA at ~3–5 yrs from baseline or earlier if clinically indicated will schedule discussion at longer chronic disease appt  
Vaccinations not addressed today due time  

Follow up  
– Phone/telehealth f/u 1/52 to discuss pathology or earlier if significant abnormality  
– Longer face to face chronic disease r/v in 2–3/12 booked as long appt at reception (may need 30–40 min)  
– ED if any features of adrenal crisis as above  

Billing  
Standard GP consult item 23 today bulk billed  

Time  
Approx 15 min consult focused on pigmentation concerns and adrenal stability broader APS hypopituitarism and osteoporosis discussion deferred to future long r/v
