22/11/25  RACF BRIS

29F temp respite. Wants “housing form done”

CC: “chronic sinus infection” x ~3–4/12. Wants letter to say current housing making her unfit to live/work there

HPI  
Nasal blockage + congestion (↑ am + nocte)  
Thick yellow nasal d/c bilat + PND  
Frontal/facial pressure esp bending fwd  
Intermittent dull HA, ↓ smell  
No visual change, no periorbital swell, no high fevers, no neck stiffness, no confusion  
Prev amoxil 7/7 ~6/52 ago, no real benefit  
Daily OTC nasal decong “for ages” → likely >3–4/52 (discussed rebound)  
Very fixated on housing / “toxic aircon” / mould / traffic fumes as cause. Wants wording re “severe chronic infection causing disability”

Obs: afeb 36.8  BP 118/74  HR 78  RR 16  SpO₂ 99% RA

Exam (targeted)  
Gen: alert, orientated, agitated/arguing but cooperative  
Nose: pale oedematous mucosa, bilat mucopurulent d/c, no obvious polyps ant  
Sinus: mild bilat frontal/max TTP  
Eyes: no periorbital erythema/oedema, EOMI, no diplopia  
Throat: mild post pharyngeal mucus, no tonsillar exudate  
Chest: clear

A  
1) Chronic rhinosinusitis w/o red flags  
   - >12/52 sx, nasal obs + mucopurulent d/c + facial pressure + ↓ smell  
   - No red flag features, no systemic toxicity  
   - Likely contrib rhinitis medicamentosa from prolonged topical decong  
2) Admin request – housing/Centrelink  
   - Pt requesting strong statement housing = primary cause + “unfit for work/housing”  
   - Current findings → symptomatic but not disabled. Env factors may aggravate but not proven. Needs longer dedicated appt

P  
CRS  
- Start intranasal steroid: budesonide (Rhinocort) 64mcg 2 sprays each nostril mane (PBS) → use daily min 4–6/52  
- Saline nasal irrigation OD–BD (FESS or homemade)  
- Advise wean/cease OTC nasal decong  
  • Plan: limit to nocte, alt nostrils x 1/52 then stop. Pt resistant but agreed partially  
- No abx today – chronic picture, no acute bacterial features explained. Pt unhappy but noted

Ix  
- Nil immediate. If poor response after 4–6/52 → consider ENT + CT sinuses ± allergy workup

Admin / forms  
- Explained cannot write “toxic aircon causing disability / unfit for all work/housing” on current evidence  
- Offered: can document dx CRS, current mgmt, note env irritants may worsen sx  
- Complex housing/Centrelink forms → needs long appt in rooms (not RACF round) + more detailed functional assessment  
- Gave brief written summary for housing worker today. Pt dissatisfied but took copy

Safety / f/up  
- Red flags d/w (visual change, periorbital swell, severe HA/neck stiffness, high fever, confusion, rapid deterioration) → ED  
- F/up GP clinic 4/52, book long appt → review response to spray/cessation decong + consider ENT/allergy + complete housing/Centrelink paperwork then  
- RACF nursing asked to prompt daily Rhinocort use + note adherence while here

RTC earlier if worse or new red flags
