Assessment  
Likely viral parotitis 2° mumps in under immunised young adult  
Features consistent bilat parotid swelling systemic sx nil features of bacterial parotitis (nil pus nil marked erythema nil high fever nil severe unilateral pain)  
High transmission risk given shared accom hospitality work incl food handling  

DDx  
Other viral parotitis eg parainfluenza influenza EBV CMV  
Bacterial parotitis less likely  
Obstructive sialadenitis / sialolithiasis less likely bilat systemic sx nil focal duct block  

Functional impact  
Pain with chewing → pref soft diet ↓oral intake  
Fatigue ↓tolerance for work shifts standing long periods  
Jaw ROM preserved so ADLs self care intact  

Investigations  
S&N / local path forms given today  
Buccal swab mumps PCR  
Bloods FBC CRP LFT mumps IgM IgG  
Results pending will call pt once back for dx confirmation and work clearance  

Plan / Management  
Symptom control  
Paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN wf if needed nil hx GI renal issues  
Cool or warm compresses to parotids

Infection control / work uni

Adv self isolate avoid work uni close contact esp preg women young kids unvaccinated  
Off work incl no food handling until at least day 5 post onset parotid swelling and while still symptomatic as per PHU guidance  
Medical cert provided 5/7 off work may extend pending course and results  

Public health  
Will notify local PHU if mumps confirmed on lab testing per state requirements pt aware  

Education

Reassured spicy food energy drinks wisdom teeth unlikely primary cause  
Discussed potential comps orchitis meningitis pancreatitis hearing loss low risk but serious hence monitoring
