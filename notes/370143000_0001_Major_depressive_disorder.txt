Imp / Dx  
1) Bilat ankle + mild hand oedema subacute  
   Likely peripheral dependent oedema 2° ↓activity + age-related venous insuff ± ↑salt intake  
   Hx not c/w acute CCF DVT nephrotic/nephritic synd or acute liver failure  but need to r/o CHF/renal/hepatic esp given age + ETOH hx  
   ?SSRI or mirtazapine related oedema less common but on DDx esp if w/u N  

2) MDD recurrent + GAD  mod  partial control  
   ↓activity deconditioning likely contrib oedema  
   Chronic ↑risk given age depn ETOH dementia but acute risk today low  SI nil  

3) Dementia mild–mod  
   Still able to engage in complex discussion  some risk med mismanagement esp if changes  

4) ETOH use d/o ongoing  
   Likely contrib to mood lability  possible long term cardiac/hepatic impact  not fully addressed today time  

Plan / Mx⇒  

Oedema / systemic w/u  
– Need F2F r/v ≤1/52 for exam incl BP wt JVP chest HS lung bases abd oedema assessment  ?signs CCF/CLD/CKD  
– Path ordered today (to do before or day of F2F as able)  
   • UEC CMP incl LFTs albumin  
   • FBC  
   • BNP  
   • TSH  
   • Fasting lipids + fasting BGL (opportunistic CV risk)  
   • Urine ACR to be done @ F2F (not yet ordered in system)  
– Nil diuretics started pending exam + baseline bloods  

Conservative Mx oedema  
– Adv leg elevation when sitting/lying avoid prolonged dependent position  
– Encourage gentle daily walking / ankle pumps as tol to ↑venous return  
– Diet: ↓salt  choose low-salt tinned soup  avoid extra table salt  

Mental health / ETOH  
– Reassured that sertaline/mirtazapine can rarely cause oedema but more common causes to be excluded first  will ?med change if Ix N and oedema persists  
– Enc re-engage psych  she will contact prev psych  offered new ref/MHCP at next F2F  
– Risk: SI nil plan nil intent  safety plan briefly revisited  aware to contact clinic/after hours or 000 if SI↑  
– ETOH: brief discussion that ETOH worsens mood + physical health esp liver/heart  plan more detailed ETOH r/v next appt ± AOD ref  

F/U  
– F2F appt booked 5–7/7 for exam oedema + MH check  ideally with path results  
– At that visit:  
   • review oedema + Ix  
   • review AD regimen AEs ?adjust  
   • focussed ETOH discussion brief intervention ± AOD services  
– Ask pt to keep simple diary till r/v  time of day vs swelling severity SOB/CP if any ETOH intake leg elevation etc  

Safety net  
– Adv urgent review/ED if sudden SOB orthopnoea CP unilateral leg swelling/redness/pain rapid ↑oedema confusion ↓UO  

Busy clinic today note brief  comprehensive dementia + ETOH review deferred to longer appt post next r/v
