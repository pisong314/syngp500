4) Hazardous EtOH use (self‑medicating mood/sleep)  

Plan (time limited, will book long review)  

Risk / safety  
– Formal suicidality screen today → mod risk  
– No current active plan/intent, agrees to seek help if ↑SI  
– Safety plan: if worse / feels may act → ED / 000. Given Lifeline 13 11 14, Beyond Blue, local MH triage  
– Adv partner to store benzos securely. Pt agreeable  
– Not at threshold for invol admit currently, but low threshold for ED if deterioration  

Meds  
– Start escitalopram (Lexapro) 5mg mane 7/7 → if tol ↑10mg mane (prev good response)  
– Couns: onset 2–4/52, early SEs (GI, ↑anx) poss, advise to report any ↑SI esp first few wks  
– Reassured not addictive. Pt reluctant but agrees to trial low dose w close f/up  

Ix (baseline / r/o contrib)  
– FBC  
– U&E, CMP  
– TSH  
– B12, folate  
– LFTs (EtOH)  
– Fasting BSL, HbA1c, lipids  
– Vit D  

Psych / supports  
– Will do GP MHTP next visit (long appt booked) → refer psych under Better Access (CBT/DBT‑informed)  
– Briefly discussed ↓EtOH (EtOH worsens mood/sleep + OD risk), ↓caffeine esp PM, basic sleep hygiene – will expand next review  

Work  
– Medical cert 3d off to start meds / stabilise. Discussed poss graded RTW later if needed  

Follow‑up  
– Long review 1/52: check mood/SI, SEs, adjust escitalopram dose, review bloods, complete MHTP. Partner welcome if pt consents  
– Adv RTC sooner / ED if ↑SI, new plan/intent, severe agitation, new manic/psychotic sx, or chest pain becomes exertional / changes  

Pt understanding  
– Still minimising “probably being dramatic” but accepts current situation not sustainable  
– Verbalised key safety steps, agrees to involve partner
