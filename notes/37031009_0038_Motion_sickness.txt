34F teacher – f/up abdo sx / travel nausea. Known vestibular migraine + long hx motion sickness  

Hx  
3/52 intermittent upper abdo “queasy/tight”, mainly epigastric, mild-mod, +nausea, no vomit  
Worse in car esp rough/unsealed roads, +sweaty “crook in the guts after 20 mins on the dirt”  
Also sometimes on school bus  
Feels different to usual vestibular migraine (“more my stomach turning, not spinning”)  
No clear food trigger, worse reading/phone in car  
No GORD sx, no Δ bowel habit, no PR blood/melaena, no wt loss, no fevers, no urinary sx  
Seen 1/52 ago similar, no red flags then, conservative advice, now persisting with more long trips  
Recent abx for sinusitis 1/12 ago – pt query “upset my gut flora”  

Vestibular migraine: dx neuro ~2 yrs, on propranolol 20 BD, stable, vertigo 1–2/mth mild. No new neuro sx, no hearing loss, tinnitus stable  

Meds: propranolol 20mg BD, Panadol PRN, COCP. No regular antiemetic  
NKDA  

O/E  
Well, NAD  
BP 112/70 HR 68 afeb  
Abdo soft, mildly tender epigastrium only, no guarding/rebound, no RUQ tend, no masses, BS normal  
Neuro grossly NAD, gait normal  

Ix  
FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, lipase ordered – Sullivan Nicolaides – mainly reassurance given remote, no red flags. Results pending  

Impression  
1) Motion sickness exacerbation → nausea + epigastric discomfort, clear motion trigger, no alarm sx  
2) Vestibular migraine – stable on propranolol, likely contributing to motion sensitivity  
3) Mild epigastric discomfort ?functional/secondary to autonomic nausea. Low suspicion PUD/biliary/pancreas at present  

Plan  
- Motion sickness  
  → Hyoscine hydrobromide 300 microg PO 30 min pre-travel, may repeat 4–6 hourly PRN (max 1.2 mg/24h). Warned re anticholinergic SE (dry mouth, blurred vision, confusion, urinary retention). Avoid driving if vision/cognition affected  
  → Option cyclizine 50 mg PO 1–2 h pre-travel, q6–8h PRN (max 150 mg/24h) if hyoscine no good. Advised test dose on non-work day re sedation (“can’t be drowsy with the kids”)  
  → Non-drug: front seat, eyes on horizon, no reading/phone, light meals pre-trip – briefly reinforced  

- Epigastric sx  
  → Reassured – no red flags today  
  → Small bland meals, avoid NSAIDs  
  → Hold off PPI for now – pt prefers to see if motion sickness tx helps. If ongoing independent of travel → consider PPI trial + further w/u  

- Vestibular migraine  
  → Cont propranolol 20 BD, no change  

Red flags discussed briefly – RTC/ED if sudden severe pain, persistent vomiting, haematemesis/melaena, jaundice, fevers, CP, new focal neuro sx  

F/up  
Review 2–3/52 or earlier if worse / meds not tolerated  
Telehealth ok for results given remote  
Asked to keep brief sx vs travel/med diary  

[Addendum 24/11/25 16:10 – Dr L Brown]  
Path back: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, lipase all wnl. No action. Pt to be informed at next review / via phone if she rings.
