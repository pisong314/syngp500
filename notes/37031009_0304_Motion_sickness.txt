Telehealth consult – phone – standard ~12 mins  

ID  
32 yr old female pt RN Anglo‑Celtic background  

Reason for consult  
C/O feeling "vertigo" type sx only when moving esp in car requesting advice and meds prior to planned 6 hr car trip in 1/52  

History of presenting complaint  
Pt describes long standing tendency to feel unwell during travel esp cars and boats says "maybe last week or its been going on for ages" when asked re onset sx actually sound chronic with recent ↑ awareness due to longer drives to work ~30–40 min each way  

Sx in detail  
- Nausea mild spinning / lightheaded sensation cold sweats when passenger in car esp on winding roads  
- Worse if reading or using phone in car esp "doom scrolling"  
- Improves when looking at horizon sitting front passenger seat or when car stops  
- Nil sx at rest nil vertigo when rolling over in bed or with quick head turns  
- Denies true room spinning at rest  
- Denies hearing loss tinnitus aural fullness  
- Denies focal neurology diplopia dysarthria limb weakness facial droop  
- Has vomited in car a couple of times unsure when "maybe last month or the time before"  
- Flights sometimes cause nausea esp take off / landing  
- Clear temporal association with motion  

Context  
Planning 6 hr road trip in 1/52 concerned she "wont cope" as passenger may need to share driving wants preventative med for motion sickness  

Pt’s own theories  
Queries if new tyres making ride "too bouncy"  
Asks if due to phone use and "stuffed eyes" sx clearly worse with screen use in moving vehicle  

Red flag screen (telehealth)  
Nil chest pain SOB palpitations syncope  
Nil sudden onset severe headache  
Nil visual loss diplopia dysarthria dysphagia  
Nil gait disturbance  
Nil fever ear pain recent URTI  
Nil recent head trauma  

Past medical history  
No known chronic medical dx  
When asked re migraine says she used to get "bad headaches" in high school but unsure if migraines pattern unclear today  
Nil known vestibular dx  
Nil prior ENT or neurology review  

Meds  
Occasional OTC analgesia "little white pill" ?paracetamol or ibuprofen used PRN for pain  
Not on regular prescribed meds  
Hx OCP a few yrs ago stopped  
Past use of OTC travel sickness meds as child remembers "one with the boat on the box" ?hyoscine effect uncertain  

Allergies  
Nil known drug allergies  

Family history  
Mother and younger sister get carsick  
Mother ?migraine hx per pt  

Social history  
RN at local hospital rotating shifts  
Drives to work most days ~30–40 mins each way  
Non smoker  
ETOH social only ~2–3 std drinks on weekends  
Lives with partner good support no pregnancy plans mentioned today  

Behavioural / communication  
Pt quite vague with timelines and med names poor historian overall  
Gives inconsistent details re onset and frequency of vomiting  
Needed repeated specific closed Qs to clarify  
Insight intact engaged tends to wander into less relevant theories eg tyres phone use  

Systems review (targeted)  
Neuro  
- Nil persistent vertigo at rest  
- Nil blackout episodes nil seizures  
- Nil weakness numbness paraesthesia speech or swallowing difficulty  
ENT  
- Nil current ear pain discharge hearing change tinnitus aural fullness  
- Nil recent URTI sinus sx  
GI  
- Nausea and occasional vomiting only in motion  
- Nil abdo pain nil altered bowel habit  
Psych  
- Nil reported anx or depn sx today  
- Sleeping variable due to shift work but feels this is baseline  

Telehealth examination (audio only)  
No vitals available phone consult home setting  
Pt speaking full sentences voice strong  
Affect appropriate coherant  
Speech fluent nil slurring  
No audible cough or wheeze nil SOB noted over phone  
Pt currently asymptomatic at rest during call  

Impression  
1 Motion sickness long standing tendency with nausea sweating and "vertigo like" sensation only in context of travel esp cars and boats sx relieved when motion stops pattern classic for motion sickness rather than primary vestibular disorder  
2 Pt described "vertigo" clarified as motion induced imbalance and nausea only nil red flags today nil features suggestive of acute vestibular neuritis BPPV central cause or Menieres at present  
3 Possible underlying migraine tendency FHx migraine vague personal hx of past severe headaches however no clear vestibular migraine pattern currently will need more detailed HA hx at later R/V if sx evolve  

Differentials considered  
- Motion sickness 2° sensory conflict visual vs vestibular input most likely  
- Vestibular migraine ? but no spontaneous vertigo no clear migraine phenotype today  
- BPPV unlikely no positional sx in bed  
- Central cause (eg cerebellar stroke MS) unlikely given chronicity pure motion trigger nil neuro deficits  
- Menieres unlikely nil hearing sx nil episodic spontaneous vertigo  

Plan  

1 Education / reassurance  
Discussed likely dx motion sickness explained pathophysiology sensory mismatch between eyes vestibular system and proprioception esp in passive passengers  
Clarified distinction between true vertigo at rest vs motion induced sx  
Non pharm strategies  
- Sit front passenger seat face forward  
- Focus on distant horizon avoid reading or phone in car  
- Adequate ventilation open window or use aircon  
- Avoid heavy meals ETOH prior to and during travel  
- Plan regular breaks every 1–2 hrs to walk get fresh air  

2 Pharmacological mgmt  
Given upcoming 6 hr trip and chronic pattern  

a) Hyoscine hydrobromide  
- eRx: Hyoscine hydrobromide 300 microgram tabs 20 tabs 0 repeats  
  Sig Take 1 tab PO 30 mins before travel may repeat 4–6 hourly PRN max 4 tabs 24h  
- Counselled re  
  - Common SE dry mouth blurred vision constipation urinary retention  
  - Possible confusion esp higher doses though low risk in young adult  
  - Sedation / blurred vision → must not drive until individual response known  
  - Advised to trial on short local trip before long drive esp if intends to share driving  
  - Avoid concurrent sedating meds and limit ETOH  

b) Backup option if hyoscine ineffective or poorly tolerated  
- eRx: Promethazine 25 mg tabs 10 tabs 0 repeats  
  Sig Take 1 tab PO 1–2 hrs before travel PRN for motion sickness may repeat 6–8 hourly max 4 tabs 24h  
- Emphasised strong sedation and impairment of performance must not drive or operate machinery if taken advised use only when passenger  
- Warned about additive sedation with ETOH or other sedatives  

3 Safety net / red flags  
Advised urgent in person review or ED if any of  
- New or persistent vertigo at rest esp if unable to walk straight  
- Sudden severe headache visual disturbance dysarthria limb weakness facial droop  
- New hearing loss tinnitus ear pain or aural fullness  
- Fever or systemic unwellness  
- Persistent vomiting unable to keep fluids down  
- Marked confusion urinary retention or severe visual disturbance after taking meds  

4 Follow up  
Suggested non urgent face to face review 2–4/52 to  
- Assess response to hyoscine / promethazine  
- Perform baseline BP HR and brief neuro and ENT exam  
- Revisit HA hx in more detail ?migraine vs vestibular migraine if sx broaden beyond motion triggers  

Pt also briefly mentioned hx intermittent "bad headaches" with nausea but unable to describe pattern due to time constraints today asked to book separate standard appt for detailed HA assessment and option of migraine mgmt if indicated
