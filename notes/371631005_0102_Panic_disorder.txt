Reason for visit  
F/U anxiety panic sx on sertaline  

ID  
81yo Anglo‑Aust woman in high care retired admin assistant  

HPC  
Known panic disorder + social phobia  
Seen ~6/52 ago after ↑anx at family gathering started sertraline 25mg mane then  

Today  
Still intermittent episodes 1–2x/wk  
  - “heart racing” sweating mild dizzy SOB  
  - sudden onset peak over few mins lasts ~5–10min  
  - often evenings alone or when thinking re health or “that article about pregnant women and panic”  
Nil chest pain radiation syncope N/V nil infective sx  
Nil clear exertional link can occur @ rest  
Using slow breathing taught last visit helps “If I remember the breathing it settles quicker”  
Still avoids big group activities “too many people looking at me”  

Pt worries re heart “Should I be worried these fast heartbeats mean something with my heart like it did for the pregnant ladies”  
Also ?caffeine trigger feels worse after 2nd instant coffee has already cut down from 3–4 to 1–2 cups/d

Exam (focused)  
Gen elderly lady neatly dressed mildly anxious not distressed  
CV dual HS nil murmur nil oedema  
Resp chest clear good AE  
Abdo soft NT  
Neuro grossly non focal gait w 4WW steady  

MSE  
Appearance behaviour calm cooperative slight fidgety hands when talking panic  
Speech normal rate/vol coherant  
Mood “abit on edge” affect anxious reactive  
Thought content focused on bodily sx heart worry re pregnancy article somatic preoccupation but reality testing intact  
Nil delusions halucinations  
Cognition grossly intact oriented to person place time  
Insight judgement good recognises panic + role of caffeine worry  

Impression  
1 Panic disorder partial response to low dose sertraline after 6/52 still panic attacks 1–2/wk but shorter ↓intensity with breathing prominent anticipatory anxiety ++ focus on palpitations SOB  
2 Social phobia chronic contributes to avoidance of RACF group activities  
3 Palpitations in elderly pt – hx/exam today not suggestive of ACS arrhythmia or decomp HF but age → need periodic cardiac check  
4 On SSRI in older pt need to monitor Na falls  

Plan  

# Panic / anxiety  
- Psychoeducation re link between autonomic sx (tachycardia sweating SOB) and panic explained that similar sx in pregnancy are same mechanism reassured current pattern obs exam c/w panic rather than primary cardiac pathology  
- Advised to alert staff / seek urgent r/v if new chest pain collapse prolonged palpitations or presyncope  

- Breathing / relaxation  
  Revised slow diaphragmatic breathing 4–5s in 4–5s out x 5–10min at onset encouraged regular practice BD not just in attacks pt able to demo  

- Meds  
  Sertraline dose ↑ 25→50mg mane for partial response and good tolerance lower geriatric range  
    Plan 25mg mane for 3/7 then 50mg mane ongoing  
    Discussed poss SE GI upset insomnia hyponatraemia asked staff to watch for confusion unsteadiness mood change esp next 1–2/52  
  Continue lorazepam 0.5mg PRN for severe panic only emphasised sparing use due falls sedation depn risk staff to keep usage log r/v next visit  

  PBS note sertraline already on PBS general no authority issues  

# Psych / CBT  
- Brief CBT style discussion today linked episodes to worry + caffeine encouraged re‑labelling as “my panic not my heart” avoid catastrophising  
- RACF has visiting psych monthly with pt consent will message facility to arrange CBT‑oriented sessions for panic + social anx graded exposure to small group activities  

# Lifestyle / triggers  
- Caffeine limit to 1 cup coffee/day avoid late arvo pt feels this already helps  
- Suggested limiting distressing TV news and bring up worrying health articles with GP or daughter instead of ruminating  

# Comorbidities / CV risk  
- HTN hyperlipidaemia stable today on perindopril + atorvastatin nil change  
- Will do fuller CVD r/v incl lipids BP trend next chronic disease check  

# Investigations (via RACF pathology this wk)  
- U&E Cr eGFR electrolytes (check Na esp on ACEI + SSRI)  
- FBC LFT  
- TSH (no recent result seen in file >12/12)  

Prev ECG ~12/12 ago reportedly NSR  
ECG not done today portable machine not avail will arrange repeat next r/v or earlier if palpitations ↑freq become exertional or assoc chest pain presyncope  

Risk  
- SI nil low acute self harm risk protective factors family future focus good insight  
- Falls baseline moderate age + 4WW emphasised to staff to monitor for ↑dizziness or unsteadiness esp after sertaline dose ↑  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to repeat plan “So I’ll go up to the 50 of the sertraline keep the breathing going and just one coffee a day If I get real chest pain or feel like I’m going to pass out I’ll tell the nurses straight away”  
Reassured most SE mild short lived advised to report anything concerning  

Follow up  
- R/V 2–3/52 on next RACF round  
  - assess response to sertraline 50mg  
  - check SE review bloods esp Na  
  - review freq/severity panic attacks and lorazepam use  
- Earlier r/v or send to ED if chest pain SOB palpitations >20min syncope new neuro sx marked mood ↓ SI or falls fever >38.5 or acute confusion
