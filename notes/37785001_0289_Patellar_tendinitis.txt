27M – R knee review (patellar tendinopathy)  

HPI  
Known R patellar tendinopathy dx ~3/12 ago here  
Still sore esp after work + basketball  
“Still giving me grief at night… I’ve only got 10 mins”  
Pain just below patella, 2–3/10 baseline, up to 6–7/10 with jumping / ladders / change of direction  
Wakes him 1–2x/week after “big days”  
No giving way/locking/catching, no true swelling, occas “puffy” post-game  
Has kept playing weekly comp despite prev advice to ↓load  
Work: lots of squatting/kneeling/ladders, hard to avoid kneeling R knee  
Uses ibuprofen 400 mg PRN – partial help  
Did not attend physio (“too hard to get into town during work hours”)  
Worried fan/cold air / heavier steel caps making it worse  

Obs  
BP 118/70 HR 72 afebrile ~BMI 25  

Exam R knee (brief – known issue)  
No deformity, no erythema, no effusion  
Localised TTP mid–prox patellar tendon just inf patella  
ROM full, mild pain end flexion + resisted ext  
Ligaments stable, McMurray -ve  
Single-leg decline squat → typical tendon pain  
L knee NAD  

Impression  
1) R patellar tendinopathy – persistent, load-related, nocturnal sx but no red flags, clinically unchanged from last review 03/05/23 15/08/24  
2) Sleep disturbance 2° pain  
Time-poor, limited access to physio  

Plan  
– Reiterated dx: overload tendon, not “wearing knee out”  
– Advised ↓jumping / high-intensity bball 4–6/52, modify work where poss (↓deep squats/kneeling, use knee pad)  
– Start simple home loading prog: slow decline squats etc (handout given) 3–4x/wk; adjust if pain ↑ >2/10 or lasts into next day  
– Strongly rec physio (regional centre) for structured tendon loading + RTS plan + work mods → referral done (he’ll “try for late arvo”)  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day)  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food ≤5–7 days at a time, avoid other NSAIDs, no hx GI/renal issues reported  
– Discussed: no role for opioids; avoid local steroid inj to tendon (↑rupture risk) – if considering inj later → sports med/ortho  
– No imaging today – clinical dx, imaging not changing mgmt, pt happy to avoid extra appts  

MH/sleep  
Denies low mood/anxiety, just “pissed off I can’t play properly”  
Basic sleep advice only (pillow under knee etc)  

Safety net  
RTC earlier if acute ↑pain, “pop”, can’t WB, ↑swelling/red/hot, fever, new locking/giving way  
Otherwise review 6–8/52 to reassess pain/sleep/function once tried load mods + exercises (book long appt if wants general check-up – deferred today due to time)
