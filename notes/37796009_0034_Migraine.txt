- No red flags: no thunderclap, no focal neuro, no speech/vision loss, no trauma  
- No aura, no weakness, no numbness  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g + ibuprofen 400 mg at onset, uses ~2–3 d/mth only, no opioids, no triptan

Impression  
1) Migraine w vestibular features (vestibular migraine) – stable, ~3–4 d/mth, no MOH, fxn ok but some work impact  
2) Vertigo – likely migraine-related, no red flag features (no hearing loss/tinnitus, no focal neuro)  
3) Gen health check – overweight range only, otherwise well, needs baseline bloods + routine screening later  

Plan  
- Acute migraine:  
  • Continue paracetamol 1 g + ibuprofen 400 mg together at onset  
  • Limit NSAID ≤10 d/mth, total simple analgesia ≤15 d/mth (explained via daughter)  
- No preventer for now – discussed options (amitriptyline / propranolol / candesartan / topiramate) → pt + daughter prefer “try no tablets first”  
- Lifestyle (brief only – time): ↓ caffeine slowly to 1–2 coffees/d, reg meals, better sleep if able  
- Vertigo safety: no driving / playground heights etc if dizzy, RTC/ED if severe vertigo + can’t walk, or new hearing loss/tinnitus  
- Red flags: ED if sudden worst HA, neuro sx (slurred speech, facial droop, weakness), HA + fever/neck stiffness, persistent vomiting – went through w daughter, pt able to repeat basics  
- Ix ordered (baseline, fasting):  
  • FBE  
  • U&E, CMP  
  • Fasting lipids  
  • Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
  • TSH  
  Forms given → on-site path  
- Immunisation/cervical screen etc next long appt (no time today)  

Interpreter  
- Daughter used as informal interpreter w pt consent “my daughter help explain”  
- Offered TIS for future – both agreeable, not arranged today (time)  

F/up  
- Review 4/52: bloods + migraine/vertigo diary (daughter to record HA/vertigo days + meds) → reconsider preventer if >4 d/mth or ↑ disability  
- RTC earlier if pattern change / red flags  

Meds/scripts  
- No new scripts – cont OTC paracetamol/ibuprofen as above  
- No PBS authority needed
