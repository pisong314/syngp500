34F here re sleep. "Only got 10 mins, just need something so I can sleep"

PC:  
- Insomnia ~3/12, worse 4–6/52  
  - ↓ sleep onset + maint. Lying awake 1–2h, waking 2–3x/night, ~4–5h broken sleep  
  - Bedtime all over the place 2230–0100, up 0600  
  - Screens in bed, TV, falls asleep on couch at times  
  - Caffeine 3–4 coffees/d (last ~1600–1700) + occ energy drink  
  - ETOH 1–2 glasses wine 3–4 nights/wk "to wind down" but "sleep still crap"  
  - Worries re work at night "brain won’t switch off"  
  - No snoring per partner, no witnessed apnoea, no waking choking. Wakes dry mouth, unrefreshed. Daytime fatigue, no near-miss driving

Hx:  
- Migraine w/out aura several yrs. Was ~2 d/mth → now 5–6 d/mth last 2/12, pt links to poor sleep  
  - Typical: uni-lat throbbing + N + photo/phonophobia  
  - No red flags: no thunderclap, no focal neuro, no visual loss, no speech issues, no fever/neck stiffness  
  - Meds: ibuprofen 400 PRN, paracetamol 1 g PRN, sumatriptan 50 mg PRN. Triptan ~4 d/mth, NSAID ~8–10 d/mth. No opioids  
- GAD – long-standing, CBT helped previously, stopped due work. ↑ stress/workload, more ruminations, no panic, no SI  
- Obesity (prev BMI 33–35). Diet poor, minimal exercise – not priority today

Meds:  
- Sumatriptan 50 mg PRN  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN  
- Paracetamol 500 mg 1–2 PRN  
- Intermittent Mg OTC  
Allergies: NKDA

O/E (brief – pt rushing):  
Tired but NAD, anxious, keeps checking watch  
BP 126/80, HR 78 reg, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA  
Body habitus obese  
Neuro grossly non-focal, speech normal  
Mild neck/upper trap tightness

A:  
1) Insomnia – likely multifactorial: GAD + poor sleep hygiene + ETOH + high screen use. OSA less likely but RF = obesity + unrefreshed sleep → monitor  
2) Migraine w/out aura – ↑ freq likely 2° sleep deprivation/stress/neck tension. Analgesic + triptan use w/in limits, no MOH currently  
3) GAD – suboptimally controlled, contributing to 1) and 2)  
4) Obesity – ongoing, not main focus today

P:  
Insomnia / GAD / migraine overlap  
- Very brief sleep hygiene chat (screens, caffeine cutback, ETOH not for sleep, regular bed/wake time). Handout given + apps suggested  
- Start amitriptyline 10 mg nocte 1–2 h pre-bed (off-label for migraine prophylaxis + sleep + anxiety)  
  - Warned re AM grogginess, dry mouth, constipation, avoid driving if drowsy  
  - May ↑ by 10 mg every 1–2/52 up to 30–50 mg nocte if needed, but will review before titrating  
- Documented potential serotonin syndrome risk if future SSRI/SNRI + triptan – currently not on AD. Advised to tell any prescriber about ami + triptan

Migraine  
- Continue current acute regime:  
  - Paracetamol 1 g QID max 4 g/d  
  - Ibuprofen 400–600 mg Q6H PRN (max 2400 mg/d). Avoid >15 d/mth  
  - Sumatriptan 50–100 mg at onset, may repeat once ≥2h if partial response (max 300 mg/24h). Limit <10 d/mth  
- Asked to keep simple HA/sleep diary (incl triggers – sleep, stress, lighting, meals)  
- If still ≥4 d/mth once sleep improved + on low-dose ami → discuss formal proph (higher-dose ami vs candesartan vs topiramate etc) at longer review  
- Mentioned neck stretches/ergonomics/physio – pt wants to defer ("no time")

Anxiety  
- Explained link anxiety ↔ sleep ↔ migraine  
- Encouraged re-engage psych here – offered referral, she prefers telehealth/early/late if possible. Will revisit  
- No current AD. Consider SSRI later if ongoing, mindful of triptan/serotonin issues

Obesity / metabolic  
- Briefly flagged need for lifestyle + screening. Pt: "can’t deal with that today"  
- Plan longer appt 6–8/52 for weight, diet, exercise, general prevention + bloods

Ix:  
- None today (time)  
- At longer review: FBE, U&E, LFT, lipids, fasting BSL/HbA1c, TSH. Consider STOP-BANG; if +ve → sleep study

Safety-net:  
- ED if sudden worst-ever HA, any neuro deficit (weakness, speech/vision change, confusion), fever/neck stiffness, or chest pain/palps/marked dizziness esp after starting ami  
- RTC earlier if insomnia or HAs significantly worse on ami

F/U:  
- 3–4/52 std appt – review sleep, migraine freq, mood, ami SE, diary  
- Separate 20–30 min appt 6–8/52 for obesity/metabolic screen/lifestyle

[Added 16:30 by Dr L. Smith – brief review of plan with registrar, agree low-dose ami reasonable trial. No change to meds. Will co-review if migraines not improving at next visit.]
