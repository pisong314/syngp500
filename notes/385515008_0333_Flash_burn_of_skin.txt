A  
1 Superficial → superficial partial thickness facial and ant neck flash burn approx 5–6% TBSA 2° electrical arc at work D3 post injury  
   - Currently appears clean healing appropriately  
   - Nil evidence airway involvement  
   - Nil current ocular sx though bright flash mechanism → poss delayed ocular issues discussed  
   - Pt somewhat minimising injury reluctant for meds/investigations so extra safety netting needed  

2 Workplace exposure / PPE issue  
   - Old dusty switchboard possible contributing factor per pt  
   - Safety glasses appear to have limited ocular involvement but not complete protection  

DDx considered  
- Flash/thermal burn most likely  
- Pure UV sunburn less likely given pattern and blistering though some concurrent sun exposure possible  
- Chemical burn unlikely nil hx  
- Electrical contact burn unlikely given hx nil entry/exit wounds  

P  
Burn care  
- Explained dx and expected course incl risk infection scarring pigment change ↑sun sensitivity  
- Emphasised need for proper wound care even if "feels alright"  

Today  
- Nursing care requested  
  - Gentle cleanse face/neck with saline  
  - Non adherent paraffin gauze to denuded cheek areas bilat light conforming bandage where feasible avoiding visual obstruction  
  - Erythematous intact areas to remain undressed advised bland moisturiser eg sorbolene to dry unbroken skin OD–BD  

Topical  
- Rx Mupirocin 2% ointment apply thin layer to open/denuded cheek areas BD for up to 7/7 or until epithelialised to ↓infection risk  
  - Advised to stop and r/v if rash irritation etc  

Analgesia  
- Suggested regular simple analgesia short term if needed  
  - Paracetamol 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h  
  - Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food if nil GI issues  
- Pt states will "only take something if it gets really bad" reassured re short term safety documented discussion  

Eyes  
- Nil current red flags  
- Safety net  
  - Seek urgent r/v or ED if eye pain photophobia watery discharge FBS or visual change  
- Offered full eye exam with fluro staining today pt declined as above  

Infection / complications  
- Education re red flags  
  - ↑pain spreading redness swelling pus fevers feeling generally crook difficulty opening mouth or eyes or any breathing/swallowing issues → urgent r/v or ED  

Sun protection / scarring  
- Strongly advised strict sun avoidance to affected areas until healed  
- Once healed advised SPF50+ broad spectrum plus hat esp at work ideally 6–12/12 to minimise pigment change scarring  

Work / safety  
- May continue work if can keep wounds clean dressed and limit direct sun/heat exposure  
- Recommended improved PPE for similar tasks eg full face shield or arc rated visor + safety glasses  
- Advised to keep dressings on while at work if soiled to change or see nurse for change  
- Offered medical certificate for light duties / indoor work next few days pt declined  

Vaccination  
- Tetanus uncertain "sometime in high school"  
- Recommended dTpa booster given today IM  
- Advised poss local soreness mild systemic sx  
- To update AIR  

Investigations  
- Nil bloods or imaging indicated currently small TBSA stable vitals well appearing  
- If delayed healing >10–14/7 or concern infection will consider FBC U&E etc  

F/U  
- Nurse wound check + dressing change 2–3/7 or earlier if concerns  
- GP r/v 5–7/7 to assess healing consider burns/plastics referral if  
  - delayed healing >10–14/7  
  - infection  
  - functional issues mouth/eyelids  
  - cosmetic concerns esp facial  

Other  
- Pt briefly mentioned occas low back soreness from work time limited today asked to book separate appt if ongoing or worsening  
- Bulk billed  

Learning points (self)  
- Facial burns from electrical flash even if small TBSA still need careful eye + airway assessment  
- Need to balance pt reluctance for intervention with importance of sun protection and wound care  

Plan discussed with supervisor Dr [Supervisor Name] during/after consult
