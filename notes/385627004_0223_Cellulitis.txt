# Impression / Dx  
1 Likely mild non purulent cellulitis R lower leg  
   - Early localised no systemic features low MRSA risk  
   - Prob 2° minor shaving trauma vs small bite initially  
   - Haemodynamically stable nil red flags for nec fasc at present pain not severe nil systemic tox nil rapid progression by hx  

2 Worried but appropriate help seeking  

Differentials considered  
- Contact dermatitis less likely unilateral warm tender non pruritic at onset no clear contact pattern  
- DVT less likely nil sig swelling minimal pain normal obs no RFs  
- Erysipelas less likely no sharply demarcated raised edge  
- Local insect bite reaction possible trigger but current picture more consistent w cellulitis  

# Ix  
Given mild uncomplicated presentation well appearing  
- Nil bloods or imaging ordered tonight  
- Borders of erythema marked w skin marker measurements documented in obs tab  

Plan discuss w supervisor Dr Singh 19:50  

# Plan  
Abx  
- Flucloxacillin 500mg PO QID 5/7 as per eTG for mild cellulitis low MRSA risk  
- Advised may need extension to 7–10/7 via usual GP if only partial response  

Analgesia  
- Paracetamol 1g PO QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
- Ibuprofen 400mg PO TDS PRN w food if nil GI issues other CI  

Local care  
- Elevate leg when resting  
- Avoid tight stockings over area initially  
- Cool compresses short periods for comfort  

Safety net  
- Discussed likely course may appear slightly worse first 24–48h despite effective abx  
- R/V GP or here 48–72h to assess response  
- ED / urgent r/v if  
  - Fever ≥38°C rigors feels very unwell or faint  
  - Rapid spread beyond marked line over hrs  
  - Severe or rapidly ↑pain esp deep or out of proportion  
  - Blisters black/grey skin or obvious pus/abscess  
  - New difficulty WB or moving ankle/knee  

Prevention  
- Brief advice re careful shaving technique moisturiser checking legs/feet for breaks tinea etc  

Follow up  
- F/U usual GP in 2–3/7 for reassessment and consider bloods eg FBE UEC BGL/HbA1c if slow to improve or concern re underlying DM  
- Pt also keen for general check up and screening suggested longer appt w regular GP next few wks  

Learning points (self)  
- Distinguishing mild cellulitis vs contact derm esp w new detergent hx  
- Reassurance vs over treating worried well in after hours setting

Supervisor addendum  
Seen d/w registrar re dx and plan I have not seen pt directly this consult but case presented in detail  

Agree appears most consistent w mild non purulent cellulitis R shin in otherwise well 54F no systemic features low MRSA risk reasonable to manage in community w oral fluclox 500 QID 5/7 marking borders and close r/v advice appropriate  

Red flag and ED advice documented agree nil Ix needed tonight provided good safety net F/U w usual GP 2–3/7
