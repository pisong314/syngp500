42M, construction site supervisor (Anglo-Australian). Known L hydrocoele from ~6–8/12 ago (other clinic, no scans on file here). Mild developmental disability (stable, lives with partner, working FT).

Came in today mainly because partner says he’s been “not himself” x 3–4 days + L scrotal swelling “getting bigger and sore”. Partner noticed he’s guarding groin and “walking funny” last 2 days.

Pt: “bit on edge and cranky” esp evenings after work. Denies low mood/anxiety, no new stressors. Thinks it’s “probably just because it’s sore and annoying”.

L scrotal sx: 3–4 days dull ache/dragging in L hemiscrotum, worse after standing all day on site. Says swelling there for months, previously told “fluid sac around testicle, hydrocele”. Now feels slightly larger and more uncomfortable. No sudden severe pain, no N/V, no abd pain. No dysuria, no freq, no haematuria, no discharge. No fevers/rigors/weight loss/night sweats. No trauma, no ↑ lifting beyond usual. No obvious groin lump into canal, no cough impulse noticed by pt.

Exam (brief, chaperone nurse in):  
Obs: BP 124/78, HR 76 reg, RR 14, T 36.8, SpO₂ 99% RA. Looks well, talking clearly.  
Abdo soft, NT, no masses. No palpable inguinal/femoral hernia on cough.  
Scrotum: L hemiscrotum enlarged, smooth, no erythema. Fluctuant, non-tender swelling around L testis, transilluminates strongly. L testis palpable within but hard to fully delineate, feels normal where felt, no discrete lump. R testis normal. No epididymal tenderness, no varicocele felt, no ↑ warmth, no inguinal LN. No features suggesting acute torsion today.

Behaviour / MSE: Alert, oriented, coherent. Mood “a bit irritable”, affect appropriate. No psychotic features. In consult calm and cooperative.

PMHx:  
– Mild intellectual impairment (longstanding, independent with partner).  
– L hydrocoele (prev dx, no op).  
NKDA. Only uses ibuprofen 400 mg PRN for aches. Non-smoker, a few drinks on weekends.

Partner worried about testicular cancer risk, esp as he may present late if something changes. Pt: “Should I be worried about cancer with this?”

Impression:  
1) L hydrocoele – symptomatic, likely slowly progressive, now causing discomfort. Testis only partly assessable clinically → need USS to exclude mass/hernia and confirm testis position. No red flags for torsion or strangulated hernia today.  
2) Behavioural change in adult with developmental disability – appears temporally related to ↑ scrotal discomfort + some sleep disruption. No current evidence of primary psych illness, delirium, substance issue or systemic infection.  
3) Testicular Ca concern – risk still low but hydrocoele obscures exam, DD may delay presentation → needs structured follow-up.

Plan (running list):  
– Explained likely hydrocoele flare: “fluid-filled sac around the testicle, bigger and a bit sore, but nothing today to suggest an emergency like twisted testicle or trapped hernia”.  
– Order scrotal + inguinal USS with Doppler (Qld X-Ray; check both testes, confirm hydrocoele, exclude intratesticular mass/inguinal hernia, document testis position).  
– Pt to sign release at reception to chase previous records/USS from prior GP (no results currently in Best Practice – may be in old file from 03/05/23 15/08/24?).

Analgesia:  
– Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (max 4 g/day).  
– Ibuprofen 400 mg PO TDS PRN with food for next 3–5 days if needed, if no GI upset.  

Advice (brief):  
– Supportive/firm underwear, try to limit prolonged standing/heavy lifting above baseline if possible.  
– Warned: if sudden severe scrotal pain, rapid ↑ swelling, redness, abdo pain, vomiting or feels systemically unwell → ED urgently (poss torsion/strangulated hernia).

Referral:  
– Non-urgent urology referral sent today (public first preference; discussed option of going private if wait too long – will decide after USS). Reason: symptomatic hydrocoele + limited palpation of testis, long-term surveillance.  

Testicular surveillance:  
– Very brief run-through of self-exam in shower, monthly, and to see GP promptly with any new lump/change in size/shape/persistent pain.  
– Added recall: annual testicular exam (esp as L testis obscured by hydrocoele).

Other:  
– Quick look at penis while there – foreskin retracts, no obvious issues.  
– Pt asked about “general check-up and bloods” (hasn’t had for years). Time limited today → asked to book longer appt for full check (BP trend, lipids, BSLs etc). No bloods ordered today.

Follow-up:  
– Review 1–2/52 with USS results or earlier if worse.  
– At review: reassess behaviour once pain better, confirm urology plan, start broader health check if time.

Pt and partner both voiced understanding of plan. Pt: “I’ll take the painkillers like you said and get the scan done this week.”

09:31 – note finished (will need to confirm external records when they arrive).
