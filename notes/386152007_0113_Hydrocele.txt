Pt: 42y M, construction. Came in mainly saying feeling “on edge all the time” last few months, and then halfway through consult mentioned “this lump down there” R side scrotum. Here alone.

Anxiety / sleep  
- Ongoing ~3–4/12, worse last few weeks. Worry re job/money, says work “up and down, boss wants us to just push through even when we’re crook”.  
- Trouble getting to sleep, lying awake with racing thoughts, getting maybe 5–6 hrs, not rested. On phone late at night, he thinks “probably not helping”.  
- Physical sx when anxious: palps, chest tight, knot in stomach, bit nauseated, no SOB. No panic attacks.  
- Mood a bit low but still enjoys kids/fishing when not too tired. No anhedonia, no hopelessness.  
- Denies SI/SH: “No way, I just want to feel normal again.”  
- Caffeine: coffee x2 + 2–3 energy drinks/day (“probably too much, hey”). ETOH mainly wknds 4–6 stds. No drugs, non-smoker.  
- No past psych dx, no meds. Wants to avoid tablets if possible, prefers “talking stuff first”.  

O/E (brief)  
BP 124/78, HR 78 reg, afeb, SpO2 99% RA, BMI ~26. Looks well, a bit tense, fidgety.  
Speech nl, thoughts coherent. Anxious but appropriate, good insight/judgement. No psychotic features.

Impression: GAD-type picture, mild–mod, stress + caffeine + poor sleep hygiene contributing. No red flags for psychosis/bipolar/SUD today.

Plan – anxiety  
- Discussed dx and contributing factors, very keen to try non-pharm.  
- Advised to cut down caffeine gradually (aim ≤1 coffee/day, stop energy drinks), basic sleep hygiene (screens off before bed etc).  
- Referred to in-house psych for CBT-style anxiety management (bulk-billed).  
- Discussed SSRI (eg sertraline) as option later if still functionally impaired, pt to consider, not starting today.  
- Gave crisis info verbally (000, local MH triage, Lifeline) if SI develops.  
- Review 3–4/52 booked to reassess anxiety/sleep and see how psych going.

Scrotal lump  
- R scrotal swelling x ~6–8/12, slowly bigger, painless but heavy by end of workday. No redness, no fever, no urinary sx, no wt loss/night sweats. Pt: “I’m a bit worried it might be cancer but it lights up with my phone torch.”  
- Monogamous with female partner, no STI concerns. No known hx undescended testes/groin surgery.

Examination (chaperone offered, declined)  
R hemiscrotum enlarged, non-erythematous. Soft, fluctuant swelling around testis, non-tender. R testis palpable, normal consistency, no discrete hard mass felt. L testis WNL. No cough impulse, no obvious inguinal hernia. R side transilluminates. No inguinal LN. Penis unremarkable.

Impression: Likely simple R hydrocele, chronic, uncomplicated. No clinical red flags for torsion/strangulated hernia/testicular tumour but needs imaging.

Plan – scrotum  
- Scrotal USS with Doppler ordered (QML) to confirm hydrocele and exclude tumour/occult hernia.  
- Explained likely benign fluid collection, but need scan to be sure.  
- Red flag advice given: sudden severe pain, rapid ↑ size, redness, systemic sx, N/V, inability to feel testis → ED / urgent review.  
- If USS confirms simple hydrocele and still symptomatic, will discuss urology referral for elective repair.  
- Asked to do monthly testicular self-checks; return with any new lump/changes.

Other  
- Briefly mentioned intermittent low back ache from work – not covered today due to time, asked to book separate appt if ongoing/worse.  

Follow-up  
- 3–4/52 with me to review anxiety, sleep, USS results, and consider SSRI vs urology referral as needed.  
- Earlier if anxiety escalates, mood deteriorates, or any acute scrotal pain/swelling.  

Pt says plan “makes sense”, agrees to cut back caffeine and attend psych. All questions re meds/working with lump addressed. 09:32
