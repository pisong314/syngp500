Home visit – f/u behaviour change  

Pt  
82yo man severe dev/int disability non verbal baseline homebound in Melb  
Known R hydrocele hx R cryptorchidism s/p orchidopexy childhood  

Reason  
Daughter requested home r/v re behaviour change ~5–6/7  

HPI  
Daughter: more withdrawn not watching usual TV pacing esp late arvo ↑fidgety  
Intermittently clutching lower abdo/groin  
Sleep poorer up/down o/n with more grunting vocalisations  
Oral intake ↓ last 3/7 but still drinking ok passing urine BMs as usual  

Daughter "hes just not himself something is bothering him"  
Pt when prompted about pain "its just a bit sore nothing really I dont want to be a bother" says "Ive put up with worse" tends to minimise  

Nil known fevers vomiting change in bowel habit visible haematuria trauma  
Daughter feels "the lump down there looks a bit bigger again" worried pads might be rubbing or "squashing things"  
Also ?frozen dinners upsetting tummy this wk  

Meds (Webster checked)  
Paracetamol 1g bd PRN pain – daughter giving ~od for last 3/7 with some benefit  
Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
Perindopril 5mg mane  
PRN bisacodyl tabs for constipation not used this wk  
NKDA  

Social  
Lives ground floor unit w daughter full time carer NDIS support worker 3x/wk 4WW indoors shower chair etc home looks safe daughter attentive  

ROS (from carer + limited yes/no)  
GU nil obvious dysuria pads usual vol/colour nil foul odour  
GI bowels 1–2/7 formed nil diarrhoea or constipation  
Resp nil cough SOB wheeze  
Neuro nil new focal sx  
Skin nil new rashes pressure areas per carer  

O/E  
Afebrile 36.9C  
BP 132/74 HR 76 reg RR 16 SpO2 98% RA  

Gen looks reasonably comfortable at rest slightly guarded w lower abdo/groin exam limited eye contact slow responses repeats "Im alright doc"  

CVS HS dual nil murmur periph oedema nil  
Resp clear good AE  
Abdo soft mild T suprapubic + R inguinal region no guarding/rebound no mass BS normal nil obvious inguinal hernia on attempted Valsalva  

GU / scrotum (chaperone daughter present consent obtained)  
L testis descended normal size/consistency NT no mass  
R hemiscrotum enlarged tense not erythematous not hot mild diffuse T esp superiorly transilluminates → c/w hydrocele testis itself hard to palpate clearly but nil discrete hard mass felt  
Nil scrotal skin breakdown despite pad use  
Nil obvious inguinal hernia w cough/strain though exam limited by cooperation  
Penis uncircumcised foreskin retractable glans clean nil lesions or d/c  

Mobility  
Back hips NT good passive ROM mobilises short distance w 4WW + supervision  

Impression / dx  
1 Behavioural change in non verbal elderly man dev disability → likely pain related  
   Most probable source R scrotal/groin discomfort from known hydrocele ?↑size/tension aggravated by continence pads ↓movement  
   Nil red flags strangulated hernia (no irreducible mass severe focal T vomiting obstructive sx)  
   Nil features acute epididymo orchitis or torsion afebrile non toxic gradual onset exam non acute  
2 R hydrocele hx R cryptorchidism s/p orchidopexy  
   Exam c/w hydrocele but testis not fully palpable ↑long term testis Ca risk given hx + poor self report → needs surveillance  
3 Severe ID high risk delayed detection testicular pathology  
4 Stoic under reporting of pain behaviour more reliable than verbal report  
5 HTN hyperlipidaemia stable today not focus  

Plan  

Ix  
Scrotal + inguinal USS w Doppler ASAP prefer mobile radiology if available otherwise daughter to arrange hosp based when transport possible  
   → confirm hydrocele size exclude underlying testicular mass  
   → assess for occult inguinal hernia  
If USS cannot be done in home setting within 1/52 advised daughter to prioritise hosp radiology appt letter provided outlining concerns  

Meds / symptom mgmt  
↑paracetamol to 1g PO q6h PRN max 4g/24h for next 3–5/7 then reassess use explained likely more uncomfortable than he admits  
No other analgesia change today nil NSAID added given age comorbs  
Pad / clothing adjust to ↓pressure on R hemiscrotum suggest looser supportive underwear ensure scrotum supported not squashed  
Encourage gentle indoor walking w 4WW avoid prolonged sitting on scrotum  

Surveillance / referrals  
Once USS result back will formalise annual testicular surveillance plan  
?non urgent urology ref depending on USS re ongoing hydrocele mgmt vs obs and discussion Ca surveillance in context of disability  
Discussed w daughter increased lifetime risk testicular Ca w past cryptorchidism and that hydrocele fluid can hide testis hence need imaging  
Suggested monthly assisted testicular check by daughter if tolerated looking for new hard lumps marked change in size/shape focal persistent T  

Safety net  
Daughter advised seek urgent ED if  
– sudden onset severe scrotal or groin pain  
– new firm or irreducible groin lump esp w vomiting or abdo distension  
– scrotal redness marked warmth or systemic sx eg fever rigors appears acutely unwell  
– marked ↓urine output haematuria or unable to pass urine  
Also generic advice given to return if fever >38.5C severe SOB chest pain or confusion  

F/U  
Phone r/v w daughter in 3/7 to check behaviour pain control and progress w USS booking  
Home visit again ~1–2/52 or earlier if USS done or sx worsen  
Deferred today due to time – full CVD risk + meds r/v suggested longer home visit or telehealth in 4–6/52 also to consider formal pain assessment tool for non verbal adults  

Billing  
Home visit bulk billed under MBS item 24 NDIS participant plan managed copy of todays note + USS request left w daughter for possible ED use
