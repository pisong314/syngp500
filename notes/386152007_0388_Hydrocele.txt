Reason for visit  
F/U re L testicular lump odd feeling review scrotal USS  

Pt details  
34 yr old male construction worker Anglo Celtic background presents alone  

HPC  
Pt here for r/v of L scrotal swelling previously noted last consult  
Says L side still feels “bit heavy like full of water”  
Onset unclear says maybe few weeks maybe longer poor recall  
Course feels about the same since last visit nil acute ↑ in size nil sudden pain  
Pain nil most of time occasional dragging heavy sensation after long day on tools  
Assoc sx  
- nil dysuria  
- nil haematuria  
- nil urethral discharge  
- nil fevers rigors N/V abdo pain  
- nil hx sudden severe testicular pain to suggest torsion  
No clear trauma recalled though says he is “always knocking myself at work”  

Sexual hx brief today due to time  
- sexually active with one long term female partner  
- usually no condoms  
- nil known STI hx  
- nil prev testicular lumps recalled  

Pt theories re cause energy drinks tool belt etc discussed not likely related  

Poor historian  
Pt struggles with timelines contradicts self re when swelling first noticed “maybe ages ago or maybe this month”  
Vague recollection of childhood issue “hernia or something with the balls” no records in EMR and cannot name hospital or surgeon  

Meds  
Nil regular that he can recall  
Intermittent OTC analgesia for back pain “the yellow packet” or Nurofen whichever around  
NKDA known  

PMHx  
Nil chronic medical conditions recorded  
Nil surgeries on file pt unsure if any childhood op “Mum might know”  

FHx  
Unclear re testicular or prostate ca  
Grandfather had “something down there” details unknown  

SHx  
Full time construction heavy manual work  
Smokes socially some weekends  
Alcohol 6–10 beers Fri/Sat  
Energy drinks most days  
Lives with girlfriend  
Drives own car nil transport issues  

Vitals  
BP 122/76 HR 78 reg RR 14 Temp 36.7°C SpO2 99% RA  
BMI approx 27 (visual estimate only not measured today)  

Examination  
General  
Well appearing NAD conversant slightly vague historian  

Abdo  
Soft NT no masses nil palpable inguinal hernia with cough impulse  

GU / scrotal exam  
Chaperone practice nurse present  
Inspection  
- L hemiscrotum enlarged smooth non erythematous skin intact  
- R testis normal size lie  

Palpation  
- L side fluctuant non tender swelling superior and anterior to testis  
  L testis palpated posteriorly feels normal size and consistency  
  Nil discrete intratesticular solid mass  
  Nil warmth nil tenderness along epididymis or cord nil obvious cough impulse  
- R testis normal size shape consistency non tender epididymis cord normal  
Nil inguinal LNs  
Penile exam not repeated today was normal last visit  

(Transillumination +ve over L swelling last visit not repeated today)  

Investigations  
Scrotal USS (since last visit report today)  
- L hemiscrotum moderate simple hydrocele anechoic fluid around L testis  
  L testis normal size echotexture nil focal lesion normal Doppler flow epididymis unremarkable  
- R testis epididymis normal  
- Nil evidence inguinal hernia or torsion  
Impression on report simple L hydrocele nil sonographic evidence testicular neoplasm  

Dx / Assessment  
1 Left hydrocele 386152007  
   Painless longstanding L scrotal swelling USS confirmed simple hydrocele  
   Testis itself normal on scan and exam nil features torsion infection hernia or malignancy  
   Currently mild–mod symptoms mainly odd sensation anxiety re ca some discomfort with prolonged standing heavy belt at work  

2 Health anxiety re testicular cancer  
   Understandable given palpable abnormality and limited understanding of USS findings  
   Reassured by normal testicular appearance on USS and exam  

3 Poor historian limited recall  
   Difficulty recalling childhood hx ?hernia ?undescended testis  
   No documentation and USS shows normal position both testes  
   Will still encourage ongoing self surveillance  

Plan  
1 L hydrocele  
   Explained USS findings in simple terms fluid filled sac around testicle benign  
   Clarified not cancer not infection not from energy drinks or tool belt  
   Discussed natural hx may stay stable slowly ↑ or occasionally resolve  
   Options  
   - conservative watchful waiting if tolerable  
   - urology ref for hydrocelectomy if size discomfort or cosmetic concern ↑ or any dx uncertainty  
   Pt currently opts to wait and see work very busy does not want time off unless absolutely necessary  
   Safety net  
   - attend ED/urgent care if sudden severe testicular or groin pain rapid ↑ in swelling redness fever N/V with testicular pain (?torsion)  
   - GP r/v promptly if new hard lump in testis itself or progressive ↑ in size over wks–mths  
   Offered routine non urgent urology ref today pt declined documented can be arranged anytime if sx worsen  

2 Testicular surveillance / education  
   Discussed monthly self exam after warm shower  
   Check each testis separately for new hard lumps marked change in size/shape persistent pain  
   Emphasised both sides incl “normal” side  
   Clarified hydrocele itself does not turn into ca but testicular ca can still occur hence ongoing checks  
   Suggested partner may help remind him pt agrees partner “onto that stuff”  

3 Work / practical  
   Advised supportive underwear esp on site  
   Avoid very tight belts pressing on scrotum  
   Nil current need for work certificate or restrictions  

4 Other issues  
   Brief mention intermittent back pain from work today not explored in detail  
   Needs separate longer consult for proper assessment meds physio etc asked to book when convenient  

Follow up  
R/v 3/12 or earlier if ↑ swelling pain new lump or any concern  
If becomes more symptomatic or anxious will arrange non urgent urology ref at that time  

Pt understanding  
Pt appeared reassured though retention of detail limited repeated key points  
Provided brief written summary in AVS “L hydrocele fluid around testicle benign watchful waiting when to worry how to check yourself” asked to show partner  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – ignore old dates above current plan as per today
