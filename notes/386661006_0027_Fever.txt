26F Aboriginal, known to practice. Works hospital admin. Usually well.  

C/O “throat’s been really sore and I feel hot and cold” x 2 days. Sudden onset, worse yesterday, “burning throat”, very tired. Home temp up to 38.8 per pt. Took Panadol 1 g 08:00 today helped a bit.  

Throat pain > on swallowing, R>L per pt but both sides. Still drinking, solids painful but managing. No drooling, no trismus. Voice a bit husky only. Mild dry cough, no SOB, no chest pain. No urinary or abdo sx. No joint pain, no rash.  

Important PMHx:  
- Acute rheumatic fever age 13, on long-term penicillin until 21, stopped per cardiology. Last echo ~2 yrs ago reportedly normal (no report in file).  
- PID (chlamydia) last year, treated, no current pelvic/urinary sx.  
No regular meds. NKDA. Non-smoker.  

Obs 09:20

SpO₂ 99% RA  

Exam – focussed  
Looks tired but not toxic, talking in full sentences.  
Throat: erythematous pharynx, enlarged tonsils with exudate bilat, uvula midline, no obvious peritonsillar swelling.  
Neck: mild tender ant cerv LN bilat. Neck supple.  
Chest: clear, good AE.  
CVS: dual HS, no obvious murmur today (brief exam).  
Abdo soft, NT. No rash or swollen joints seen.  

Impression:  
Acute tonsillitis / pharyngitis, likely Group A strep (fever, exudate, tender nodes, minimal cough).  
Hx ARF + Aboriginal background → high risk for recurrence, low threshold to treat. No current features of carditis/arthritis, no red flags for quinsy or airway compromise. PID hx not relevant to current fever.  

Plan (started today):  
- Phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg PO BD x 10 days (empirical for strep given ARF risk; stressed must complete full 10 d even if better).  
- Paracetamol 1 g PO QID PRN (max 4 g/24 h).  
- May use ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food if needed and well.  
- Throat swab for MCS incl GAS sent.  
- FBC, CRP, ESR ordered today given ARF history.  
- Discussed risk of rheumatic fever recurrence; advised early review for any future sore throats/fevers.  

Safety net:  
RTC/ED if ↑pain, difficulty swallowing/breathing, drooling, unilateral severe pain with trismus/voice change, or fever >48–72 h despite abx; also if new chest pain, palpitations, SOB, or joint pain/swelling.  

Follow-up:  
- Review 2–3 days with GP (or earlier if worse) – check clinical response + review prelim bloods if back.  
- Will phone with throat swab result, adjust abx if needed.  
- Longer appt 4–6 wks: revisit ARF hx, consider repeat echo referral; also sexual health check re prior PID.  

Pt understands and agrees with plan, aware of possible abx side effects and to seek help if rash/breathing issues.  

[No previous relevant bloods in system re ARF; last echo report not on file – to chase at later date.]
