22/11/25  09:15  Tel consult (new pt to clinic)  

27F on phone re “tummy pain” x few days. Known “phobia about getting really sick” – dx by prev GP per pt, no meds.

Abdo pain hx a bit all over the place – mainly around umbilicus and LIF, crampy, “like bad period pain but my period isn’t due”. 3–4 days, intermittent, 3–5/10, not waking her. No clear food trigger. No radiation. Some bloating, “lots of gurgling”. Bowels usually daily, now ~q2days, harder stool, small motion this morning, no blood/mucus/melena. Mild nausea only yesterday, no vomiting, drinking ok. No dysuria/frequency/urgency/haematuria, no flank pain. No PV bleed/discharge. LMP ~10 days ago, regular 28–30d, not usually heavy or painful. Sexually active with 1 male partner, condoms “most of the time”, last intercourse 1 week ago. Unsure re pregnancy – “don’t think so but possible”. No fevers, rigors, wt loss, night sweats, CP, SOB, recent gastro or travel.

Very anxious about appendicitis/“something bursting”. Keeps googling. Says previously saw psych for exposure therapy which helped, stopped due to cost/availability. No current psych meds, denies panic attacks, suicidality, self-harm. Sleep only a bit restless last 2 nights.

Telehealth “exam” (limited): sounds well on phone, full sentences, no SOB. Reports temp 36.8 at home. Self-palpation – mild peri-umbilical/LIF tenderness only, no focal severe RIF pain, no rebound/guarding by her description. Can hop on one leg without ++ pain. No obvious distension/jaundice/rash reported.

PMHx: phobic/anxiety around health. No IBD/IBS/coeliac known, no abdo surgery, no gynae hx mentioned.  
Meds: only occasional Nurofen for period pain (hasn’t taken for this). No OCP, condoms only. NKDA.  
SHx (brief): lives with housemate, casual retail, irregular meals, non-smoker, social ETOH. Chose bulk-billing due to cost.

Assessment (provisional – telehealth only):  
1) Non-specific mild lower abdo pain with constipation/bloating – low suspicion surgical abdomen right now but telehealth limits. Appendicitis, gynae causes (torsion, cyst, ectopic), UTI/PID etc considered less likely but not ruled out.  
2) Health-focused phobic disorder contributing to distress and focus on symptoms.  
3) Possible early pregnancy (inconsistent condoms) – needs exclusion given abdo pain.

Plan (discussed):  
- Conservative trial for bowels: ↑fluids, fibre, regular meals as able. Suggested OTC macrogol (Movicol) 1 sachet daily, can go to BD short term if no BM in 48 hrs.  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g up to QID prn (max 4 g/day). Avoid NSAIDs for now esp until pregnancy clarified.  
- Advised home urine pregnancy test today or tomorrow a.m. – if +ve or unclear, to seek urgent face-to-face review/ED depending on pain.  
- Strongly advised in-person review within 24–48 hrs at this clinic or local GP/after hours for: vitals, full abdo exam, pelvic exam if indicated, urine hCG, +/- urine dip/MSU, bloods (FBC/CRP/U&E/LFT/lipase) and pelvic/abdo US if warranted. Explained telehealth can’t safely exclude appendicitis/ectopic etc.

Red flag advice (kept brief): go to ED/000 if sudden severe or constant abdo pain esp RIF, marked tenderness/guarding, persistent vomiting, can’t keep fluids down, fever >38 with worsening pain, fainting/dizziness, shoulder tip pain, heavy PV bleeding, +ve preg test with pain, or new urinary sx with fever/flank pain. Otherwise if pain not settling in 5–7 days or changes character → earlier review.

Mental health: brief reassurance and normalising some anxiety but highlighted pattern of googling escalating worry. Suggested we do GP Mental Health Treatment Plan at F2F if she’s keen (she is). Mentioned CBT and possibility of SSRI later if needed after proper assessment; outlined common SSRI SEs briefly (GI upset, sleep change, sexual SEs, transient ↑anxiety initially). No scripts started today.

Contraception/sexual health: flagged inconsistent condom use, recommended proper contraception discussion (OCP/LARC, STI screen) at longer F2F appt once acute issue reviewed – she agreeable.

Follow-up:  
- Pt plans to do home preg test tonight and attend clinic tomorrow after shift if can get booking; otherwise to use local after-hours/ED if red flags.  
- Safety net provided as above.  

Billing: telehealth, new pt, likely billed as Level B, bulk billed.  

10:02 – note finished, a bit rushed.
