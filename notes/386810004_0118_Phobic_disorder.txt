GP reg: Dr ___  
Supervisor: Dr ___  

Reason for visit  
F/U re known needle/blood phobia + major depn  
Pt: “here about my fear thing” and “to check if it’s normal that like 10 to 30 percent of kids have it”  

HPI  
32yo Anglo-Australian F admin assistant @ local GP practice  
Known specific phobia blood‑injection‑injury type + MDD  

Historian  
Pt quite vague with dates + meds abit inconsistent info “I’m not sure” re timeline keeps changing when clarified  

# Phobia  
Longstanding needle/blood phobia from childhood per old notes  
Today “I read that like 10 to 35 percent of kids get this so maybe mine just never went away”  
Still very anxious around blood tests injections seeing blood at work  
Sx when exposed or even talking about it  
- “I nearly faint every time someone mentions needles”  
- sweats nausea light headed feels like might pass out needs to sit or leave room esp during vax clinics  
Nil actual LOC recently  
Avoiding own care  
- fasting bloods requested ~4–5/12 ago in EMR pt thinks “maybe last month or earlier this year I can’t remember” not done  
Feels phobia maybe ↑ lately “nerves fried” from more coffee + TikTok scrolling  
Also worried “too much cola at work is thinning my blood and making me more likely to faint with needles” reassured not the case though caffeine may ↑anx  

# Depression  
Dx MDD ~2yrs ago  
On sertraline 50mg nocte per EMR PBS  
Pt unsure “I’m on the little white one or was it blue the chemist knows”  
Mood now “a bit low but better than last year”  
Energy ok still some ↓interest  
Sleep 5–7h broken early waking  
Nil SI “I get sad but I’m not gonna do anything”  
Nil psychotic Sx  
Function  
Working admin still but finds staff vax clinics + pathology pickups “really stressful” due to needles sometimes swaps tasks  

# Social / substance  
Lives with housemate supportive  
Parents nearby involved “they worry a lot”  
No partner  
EtOH 4–8 std drinks/wk sometimes more after “bad day”  
Nil illicits non smoker  

Past psych hx  
Childhood onset needle/blood phobia  
No formal CBT exposure work  
Had brief EAP counselling “ages ago cant remember when”  
One past episode passive SI no attempts  

Other PMHx  
Prev mild iron deficiency  
Otherwise nil sig chronic dx recorded  
NKDA  

Meds  
From EMR reconciled today  
- Sertraline 50mg nocte started ~18/12 ago mostly adherent “sometimes miss one if I forget”  
- COCP levonorgestrel/EE 150/30 daily continuous  

Examination  
Gen  
Alert well looking mildly anxious cooperative  
Occasionally tangential vague on detail  
Vitals  
BP 118/72 HR 78 reg RR 14 SpO2 99% RA afebrile  
BMI ~25 from last visit not rechecked today time  
Mental state  
Appearance neat good hygiene  
Behaviour engaged becomes tense wringing hands when talking re needles  
Speech normal rate/vol slight hesitancy when recalling hx  
Mood “a bit flat but okay”  
Affect constricted but reactive congruent  
Thought form largely linear though vague at times  
Content prominent anticipatory anx re blood/needles  
Nil delusions  
SI nil HI nil  
Perception nil halucinations  
Insight/judgement reasonable recognises fear excessive + interfering with care  

Screening (informal today)  
Depn sx present but mild function preserved  
Anx highly situational re BII phobia picture  

Investigations  
None ordered today due to time + pt avoidance re venepuncture  
Discussed need for routine bloods FBE ferritin UEC LFT TFT fasting lipids FBG/HbA1c given past iron deficiency + ongoing SSRI  
Plan to tie in with graded exposure + nurse support see below  
Last iron studies ~18/12 ago per EMR ferritin low‑normal (cant see exact value quickly)  

Assessment  
1. Specific phobic disorder – blood‑injection‑injury type longstanding childhood onset  
   Currently impairing access to care (avoiding necessary blood tests)  
   Meets criteria marked fear immediate anx avoidance insight preserved persistent >6/12  
2. Major depn – currently mild partially controlled on sertraline 50mg nocte  
   Nil current SI/HI function@work maintained  
3. Health care avoidance 2° needle phobia → delayed monitoring (iron SSRI etc)  
4. ↑ caffeine intake + some EtOH which may be contributing to anx + sleep disturbance  

Plan  
Phobia – main focus today  
- Psychoeducation  
  Explained specific phobias often start in childhood and can persist into adulthood if untreated  
  Prevalence 10–35% in kids consistent with what she read  
  Normalised but emphasised treatable  
- Therapy  
  Discussed 1st line psych therapy esp CBT with graded exposure  
  Plan for MHCP at longer appt  
  Today provided provisional referral to local psych experienced with anx/phobias (will formalise MHCP next visit)  
- Practical graded exposure around blood tests  
  Discussed stepwise plan with pt  
  1) Nurse visit to pathology collection area only meet staff talk through process nil needle  
  2) Second visit with EMLA application practice lying down breathing exercises option to abort before needle  
  3) Then attempt actual bloods lying flat using applied tension technique to ↓vasovagal risk support person if desired  
  Pt agreeable “as long as I can back out if it’s too much” documented that exposure should be collaborative not forced  
- Med options  
  Discussed possible short term diazepam 2–5mg PO ~30min pre venepuncture as event based only if non pharm strategies insufficient  
  Risks explained sedation impaired driving dependence with repeated use  
  Given infrequent exposure + age low falls risk may be reasonable limited occasions  
  For now will try psych + graded exposure first will revisit closer to blood test date  

Depression  
- Continue sertraline 50mg nocte appears to be helping mood vs last year side effects nil sig per pt  
- Encouraged adherence phone reminders pill box etc  
- Formal PHQ‑9 GAD‑7 next longer appt for baseline scoring  

Lifestyle / contributing  
- Caffeine  
  Suggested gradual ↓ coffee cola aim ≤2 caffeinated drinks/day pt feels this “might help my nerves settle”  
- EtOH  
  Briefly advised to keep to NHMRC guidelines ≤2 std drinks/day with some alcohol free days EtOH can worsen mood/anx  
- Sleep hygiene touched on only time limited  

Safety  
Currently low acute risk  
SI nil plan nil protective factors work family housemate engaged in care  
Provided crisis contacts Lifeline local MH team advised ED/000 if SI escalates or feels unsafe  

Deferrals (time)  
- Full physical exam + general preventive check including cervical screen vax status weight BP trend metabolic screen deferred  
- MHCP not completed today due to time will do at next 30min appt  
- Formal scales PHQ‑9 GAD‑7 deferred  

Follow up  
- Book 30min appt in 1–2/52 for  
  • MHCP completion + detailed psych referral  
  • Formal mood/anx assessment  
  • Plan/booking staged blood test visits with practice nurse + local path (QML/SNP depending on usual) incl first non‑needle visit  
- Earlier R/V PRN if mood worsens ↑avoidance or any concerns  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to summarise that phobia is common but treatable goal is gradual step by step exposure not being “thrown in the deep end”  
Acknowledges importance of eventually doing blood tests “I know I can’t avoid it forever” willing to work towards this slowly

Supervisor addendum – Dr ___ 22/11/25 16:10  
Discussed case with reg after consult  
Agree with overall assessment BII specific phobia longstanding + mild MDD currently stable on sertraline 50mg  
Avoidance of venepuncture now impacting care so focus on graded exposure appropriate  

Would prioritise timely MHCP + psych input  
Happy with staged nurse/pathway plan for blood tests including applied tension + lying flat  
Agree to hold off on diazepam initially though reasonable as event‑based backup if exposure work insufficient emphasise non‑recurrent use and driving restrictions  

Depn appears mild nil current SI safety plan adequate  
Learning points discussed with reg  
- importance of linking investigations with exposure hierarchy in BII phobia  
- using applied tension technique to reduce vasovagal episodes  
- documenting risk assessment even when risk low
