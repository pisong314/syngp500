Came in saying wants a “proper check-up head to toe” and very worried about “lazy eye turning into something serious like cancer or blindness / brain tumour”. Lots of reading online. No acute sx today – specifically denies headache, diplopia, eye pain, photophobia, sudden vision change, flashes/floaters, focal neuro sx.

Known: L amblyopia + strabismus since childhood, myopia/astigmatism, mild spastic diplegic CP (independent). No regular meds, NKDA. No hx DM/HTN.

Keeps asking about “full body scan just to be sure”. Explained we don’t do whole body scans in absence of sx, risk of incidental findings etc. Reassured that CP does not ↑ risk of “eye cancer” on current evidence.

Eyes today:
- VA with glasses: R 6/6, L 6/18 → ~6/12 pinhole (same amblyopic pattern as hx)
- Mild constant L esotropia
- EOMI, pupils normal, fields grossly intact
- Fundoscopy: discs sharp, no papilloedema, no obvious retinal lesions

Neuro screen essentially baseline for her CP – mild ↑ tone LL, walks independently, CN grossly intact.

Vitals all normal, BMI ~23.

Impression:
1. General health check – well, no red flags on hx/exam.
2. Longstanding L amblyopia/strabismus + refractive error – stable pattern, no signs of acute ocular or intracranial pathology.
3. Mild CP – stable.
4. Marked health anxiety / reassurance seeking around vision and cancer; no current risk issues disclosed.

Plan:
- Explained findings and that current exam not suggestive of tumour / acute eye disease.
- Encouraged wearing glasses esp at work/driving (she often doesn’t due to feeling self‑conscious).
- Referral to ophthalmology for formal review (vision, refraction, strabismus/amblyopia) – last specialist >5 yrs. Asked to book in next few months, sooner if sx change.
- Bloods ordered as part of general screen (pt keen): FBC, U&E, LFT, fasting lipids, fasting glucose/HbA1c, TSH.
- Cervical screen up to date (next due ~2 yrs). No STI screen today (low risk, declined).
- Brief discussion that excessive internet searching likely fuelling anxiety; suggested we book longer appt to focus on this (MHCP + psychology/CBT for health anxiety). She agrees in principle but still asking “are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests today?” → reiterated no red flags, tests guided by sx.

Safety net: return earlier / urgent review if sudden change in vision, new severe headache, focal neuro deficit, or other concerning sx.

Follow‑up: 2–3/52 for blood results + more time for anxiety/mental health and to check she has made ophthal appt.

Path forms reprinted – pt misplaced original on way out, reissued. She again asked about “MRI just to check my brain”. Re‑explained no indication at present; will revisit if new sx arise.
