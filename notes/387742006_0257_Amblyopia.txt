22/11/25  Home visit – f/up  

72F (retired admin, CP) – inner Melb. Mostly homebound. Seen today mainly re “another referral for my eyes”.

Vision stuff  
Longstanding L amblyopia + L esotropia since childhood. Known to ophthalmology, last seen ~4 yrs ago, told stable then.  
Now ~6–12/12 gradual ↓vision, esp small print/TV, and depth perception off – “keep misjudging the doorway and bumping my shoulder”. No sudden loss, no curtain, no flashes/floaters change, no pain/redness. No new diplopia beyond baseline “turn” in L eye.  
Wearing old bifocals >4 yrs, scratched. More glare in afternoon in lounge. Worried “the good eye is going as well”. Reassured likely age‑related (refractive ± cataract) but needs formal review.  

PMHx (relevant)  
- L amblyopia, L esotropia.  
- Cerebral palsy (spastic, LL>UL), non‑progressive, high falls risk.  
- HTN – appears controlled. Last clinic BP 128/76 (Mar 2024).  
- Hyperlipidaemia – last lipids (Mar 2024): TC 4.6, LDL 2.1 on atorva 20mg.  
- ?Early cataracts noted by optom ~3 yrs ago (pt report).  
- No DM known. No prev glaucoma/retinal tears/surgery.  

Meds  
Perindopril 5mg mane, atorvastatin 20mg nocte, PRN paracetamol. No eye drops. NKDA.  
No med changes today (chronic disease review deferred).  

Exam (limited – home)  
Gen: Alert, oriented, NAD.  
Obs: BP 132/74, HR 74 reg, RR 16, afeb, SpO₂ 98% RA.  
Eyes: L esotropia. No redness/discharge. Pupils equal, reactive, no obvious RAPD.  
Near VA with current glasses (poor conditions): R ~6/12, L CF 1–2m (known), binoc ~6/9. Fields grossly full. EOM grossly full, no new diplopia.  
Neuro grossly as per known CP, no new focal deficits.  

Falls / environment – brief  
Some near‑misses around coffee table, no actual falls recently. Lounge with loose rugs + coffee table in main path, glare from large window. Discussed as likely contributing with reduced depth perception.  

Ix  
None done today (no ophthalmoscope).  
Planned – home collection pathology (pt overdue routine bloods):  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
- U&E, CMP  
- Lipids  
- FBC  

Assessment  
1. Longstanding L amblyopia + strabismus – stable by hx, but functionally significant.  
2. Gradual subjective visual decline, likely age‑related refractive change ± cataract in “good” eye, on background amblyopia. Needs non‑urgent but timely ophthal review.  
3. CP with impaired mobility – visual change ↑falls risk.  
4. HTN/hyperlipidaemia – apparently stable, chronic disease review and monitoring due (last full review Mar 2024).  

Plan  
- Referral done today to local public hospital eye clinic for full assessment:  
  • Check status of amblyopia/strabismus.  
  • Assess for cataract, macular disease, glaucoma etc.  
  • Advice on new script vs low‑vision aids.  
  Aim review in next 3–6/12 (sooner if acute change). Daughter to organise booking/transport.  
- Path forms left for home collection (within 1–2 wks) – fasting. Will use for chronic disease review as well as to exclude metabolic contributors.  
- Environmental: suggested minimising afternoon glare (use blinds, reposition chair) and removing loose rugs / shifting coffee table – daughter agreeable.  
- OT / My Aged Care home safety + falls assessment – to arrange at next longer visit (paperwork not done today).  
- Chronic disease (BP, lipids, vax, pain/mobility) – deferred due to time, plan dedicated 30 min home visit.  

Safety net  
If sudden vision loss, new flashes/floaters, curtain, painful red eye, or significant ↑falls / new neuro Sx → ED/urgent eye clinic. Otherwise RTC if worsening vision.  

F/up  
Book longer home visit in ~4 wks (30 min) to:  
- Review bloods + BP  
- Check if ophthal appt booked  
- Do OT/My Aged Care referral and more formal falls assessment.
