Telehealth video r/v – Sydney based GP (pt in regional NSW)  
MBS 92746 telehealth long consult bulk billed

ID  
34F primary school teacher known to practice hx IBD + chronic pelvic pain

Reason for consult  
- Req ref re ongoing chronic pelvic pain  
- ?role of long term copper IUD  
- ?need to exclude actinomycosis or “anything more sinister”

HPC  
Chronic pelvic pain >3 yrs multifactorial per prior gynae  
Last detailed r/v 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 in file  

Today  
Pain pattern largely similar but ↑ freq of “bad days” last 6–9/12  
- Dull deep pelvic ache suprapubic and L>R LIF  
- Baseline ~2–3/10 flares to ~7/10 esp around menses + mid cycle  
- Worse after long days standing teaching after intercourse sometimes  
- Episodes hrs to full day partial relief simple analgesia + heat pack  

Assoc sx  
- Nil fevers rigors systemic unwell  
- Nil abn PV discharge  
- Some intermittent post‑coital spotting 3–4/12 small vol settles <24h  
- Periods regular 28–30d slightly more crampy than a few yrs ago  
- Weight stable by pt report  
- Bowel: known IBD (prob UC) says currently quiescent nil new diarrhoea PR bleed or nocturnal sx beyond baseline

IUD  
Copper IUD in situ ~8 yrs replaced once @5yr mark total ~8 yrs continuous use  
Pt has read about pelvic actinomycosis in long term IUD users asking if could be contributing  
Aware of Actinomyces colonisation issue  

Prev workup  
Pelvic USS ~18/12 ago reportedly “unremarkable”  
Last in person pelvic exam + CST ~2 yrs ago normal per results  

Pt goals today  
Wants comprehensive assessment chronic pelvic pain including  
- Check IUD position  
- Consider pelvic floor physio  
- Clarify need for further imaging / invx  
- ?screen for actinomycosis  

Thinks small classroom chairs maybe contributing pelvic floor dysfunction  
Also queried kefir/probiotics effect on vaginal flora brief reassurance nil clear link sx can continue if tolerated

Red flags screen  
Nil acute severe unilateral pain nil shoulder tip  
Nil dysuria freq flank pain  
Nil N/V  
Nil anorexia night sweats wt loss  
Nil hx abn CST  
Dyspareunia not severe enough to stop intercourse but “deep ache” after ~1/3 occasions

PMHx  
- Chronic pelvic pain syndrome working dx from gynae ~3 yrs ago likely multifactorial incl dysmenorrhoea IBD overlap probable myofascial / pelvic floor  
- IBD likely UC dx early 20s in shared care w regional gastro currently clinically in remission  
- Long term copper IUD use as above  

Meds  
- Mesalazine oral maint (brand/dose not confirmed today in file as Asacol HD – to reconfirm next visit)  
- PRN paracetamol ibuprofen for flares  
- Multivitamin probiotic  

Allergies  
NKDA

Gyn/Obs  
G1P1 NSVD 7 yrs ago uncomplicated  
Menses as above  
Last CST ~2 yrs ago negative  
STI screen incl chlamydia/gonorrhoea negative same time IUD checked nil new partners monogamous

Social  
Lives with partner + child regional NSW  
FT primary teacher on feet all day pain impacts classroom esp on bad days  
Non smoker occ ETOH good health literacy very engaged

Telehealth limitations  
Video adequate  
Explained unable to do abdo/pelvic/bimanual/spec exam or take swabs today need f2f r/v for this pt understands

Exam (via video)  
Gen well appearing alert coherent nil distress  
Colour looks normal nil obvious pallor or jaundice  
RR talking full sentences nil SOB  
Gait briefly seen normal  
Pt points to suprapubic and LIF as pain site  
No obvious wt loss vs prior video consults

Differentials (briefly discussed)  
- Chronic pelvic pain syndrome multifactorial incl central sensitisation  
- Dysmenorrhoea / ?endometriosis not yet excluded lap  
- IUD related issues eg malposition chronic low grade endometritis rare pelvic actinomycosis  
- IBD related visceral hypersensitivity vs flare (currently unlikely given hx)  
- Pelvic floor dysfunction / myofascial pain

Investigations  
Given telehealth + nil red flags plan pre‑gynae workup via local services  

To be emailed/faxed to local providers  
- Pelvic USS TA + TV to assess IUD position uterus adnexa masses etc  
- FBE CRP ESR  
- CMP LFTs baseline  

When pt able to attend f2f (here or local GP)  
- Endocervical swab for M/C/S incl Actinomyces  
- Vaginal swabs if develops discharge pruritus etc (currently nil sx so not urgent)

Plan / Mgmt  

1. Chronic pelvic pain long term IUD  
Discussed overall picture more c/w chronic pelvic pain / ?endometriosis type pattern than frank pelvic sepsis  
Explained pelvic actinomycosis rare though assoc with long term IUD colonisation alone does not = dx or need for abx / removal unless symptomatic  

Plan  
- Ref to gynae with interest in chronic pelvic pain + IUD mgmt at nearest regional / tertiary centre  
  Ref letter to include  
  - Hx chronic pelvic pain  
  - Long term copper IUD use  
  - IBD background  
  - Pt concern re actinomycosis  
  Request  
  - Full pelvic exam + review imaging  
  - Assess for endometriosis or other structural causes  
  - Consider IUD removal vs replacement vs continue  
  - Advise on further invx eg lap if indicated  
- Will mention pt keen on multidisciplinary approach gynae + pelvic floor physio + pain team if avail regionally  

2. IUD / ?actinomycosis  
Discussed eTG style guidance  
- IUD removal + prolonged abx only if clinical pelvic actinomycosis suspected or confirmed  
- Current hx lacks systemic features mass effect or severe pain pattern  
Reasonable to do swab + updated imaging as screen and then defer further decisions to gynae  

Safety net  
Advised urgent in person r/v GP or ED if  
- Sudden severe pelvic pain esp unilateral or with shoulder tip  
- Fever >38.5C rigors feeling very unwell  
- Heavy PV bleeding foul discharge  
- Marked change in bowel habit PR bleed wt loss or other GI red flags  

3. IBD  
Currently stable by hx  
Advised continue usual mesalazine and regular gastro f/u  
Will cc gynae ref to gastro if pt wishes she agrees wants coordinated care

4. Analgesia / sx control interim  
Continue simple analgesia  
- Paracetamol up to 4g/24h max  
- Ibuprofen PRN if GI tolerates and no IBD flare  
Suggested structured use around predictable flares eg menses rather than waiting til severe  
Non pharm  
- Heat packs gentle stretching pacing activity @work  

Discussed future options eg hormonal strategies neuropathic agents but best guided by gynae after updated assessment + USS

5. Issues deferred due to time  
- Mental health impact of chronic pain pt mentioned “it does get a bit draining at school on the bad days”  
  Plan longer f2f appt in coming 4–8/52 to explore mood sleep poss psych ref / MHCP if indicated  
- Full med rec for IBD not completed today to do next visit  

Pt engagement  
Pt very engaged uses terms like “risk benefit ratio” “central sensitisation” summarised plan back accurately agreed with approach aware of telehealth limits

Follow up  
- Email/fax pathology + imaging forms to local providers today  
- Draft gynae ref this week copy to pt via secure messaging  
- Pt to book  
  - F2F GP r/v 4–6/52 for pelvic exam swabs and to go over invx results  
  - Longer appt 1–2 mths to discuss chronic pain impact mental health and any gynae feedback  

Standard advice given to return earlier if sx worsen or new concerns  

[Addendum 24/11/2025 16:30 – Dr L Chan]

Note: last CST result rechecked in file 19/10/2023 – NILM HPV negative (slightly more recent than pt recollection) no change to plan
