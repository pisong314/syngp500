Impression / Dx  
1 Suspected acute uncomplicated cystitis 2° lower UTI young non preg F classic triad dysuria freq urgency + suprapubic discomfort nil systemic features low concern pyelo  
2 Localised irritant/contact dermatitis vs razor burn/friction derm suprapubic/upper groin likely multi factor recent shaving tight scrubs new detergent high potency steroid use on thin skin Unlikely directly linked to UTI  
3 Pt factors – strong pre formed beliefs from internet argumentative about cause of sx required ↑time for explanation reassurance + boundary setting re scope of TH and abx use  

Plan  

#1 Cystitis  
Discussed options symptomatic only vs delayed vs immediate abx  
Explained most simple UTIs self limiting abx shorten sx few days ↓small risk pyelo sepsis discussed potential SE GI upset thrush resistance  

Pt very keen immediate abx “I’m not waiting a week to see if you were wrong” given symptom burden and work as RN agreed reasonable  

Meds  
- Nitrofurantoin 100mg PO BD with food 5/7 (eRx to preferred pharmacy) advised avoid urinary alkalinisers as ↓efficacy  
- Analgesia  
  Paracetamol 1g PO q6h PRN (max 4g/24h)  
  Ibuprofen 400mg PO 8 hourly PRN up to 3/7 with food if nil GI issues  

Fluids maintain usual intake no need to push excessive  

Investigations  
No MSU ordered today classic first episode uncomplicated cystitis in healthy young F discussed option MSU MCS if sx persist >1/52 recur or for future planning pt initially wanted “every possible test” then declined when informed needs in person collection and may not change immediate mx  

Red flags / safety net  
Advised urgent in person r/v GP or ED if  
- Fever ≥38° rigors flank/loin pain vomiting feeling systemically unwell  
- Visible haematuria  
- Nil improvement or worsening urinary sx after 48–72h abx  

Generic safety net also given re seek help if SOB chest pain confusion or sx otherwise acutely worse  

#2 Rash – likely irritant/contact derm / shaving irritation  
Explained likely separate issue from UTI more c/w local irritation from shaving friction tight synthetic scrubs +/- new detergent  
Pt disagrees “That’s not what the internet says” but accepts shaving may contribute  

Mx  
- Stop mometasone 0.1% groin discussed risk skin atrophy with potent steroid in flexural/thin skin  
- Start hydrocortisone 1% cream thin layer BD to affected area 5–7/7 then cease  
- Emollient eg sorbolene fragrance free avoid perfumed soaps hot showers tight synthetic clothing until settled  
- Avoid further shaving/waxing area until resolved  

Red flags for rash  
In person r/v ASAP if rash spreads rapidly blisters weeping ↑pain systemic sx or any vulval ulceration to exclude HSV cellulitis drug rxn etc  

Counselling / interaction  
Pt repeatedly states “You doctors never listen I told you it’s the water and detergent”  
Validated discomfort and work impact outlined evidence based approach emphasised shared decision making set limits eg not prescribing broader spectrum abx “just in case”  
Pt able to repeat back plan and red flags though still not convinced re aetiology  

Other  
Pt briefly mentioned intermittent tension type HAs on night shifts noted unable to explore fully today advised book separate std appt if ongoing  

F/U  
Telehealth or in person r/v 3–5/7 if  
- urinary sx not significantly beter or  
- rash not improving or worsening  

Same day in person if fever flank pain vomiting feeling very unwell or other red flags as above  

Otherwise F/U PRN if sx recur within 3/12 will consider MSU MCS review voiding habits sexual hx prevention strategies  

15 min TH consult focus on UTI + rash only
