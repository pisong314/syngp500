New pt to me  
After hours r/v for acute rash  

# Reason for visit  
24F C/O painful rash "skin is really tender like burning not really itchy" worried re "eczema herpeticum" and "brain infection from chickenpox"  

# HPI  
Onset 3/7 ago felt fluey at work mild HA fatigue low grade fever  
Rash started ~36h ago trunk → spread to scalp face prox limbs  
Describes small red spots → vesicles now some crusted  
Main sx skin tenderness stinging esp torso under bra line pain 6/10 when clothes rub  
Itch only mild  

Nil eye pain visual change facial weakness  
Nil confusion neck stiffness photophobia severe HA  
Nil cough SOB pleuritic CP  
Nil N/V now tolerating fluids ↓appetite but eating small meals  
Nil abdo pain GU sx joint pains  

Very anxious after googling eczema herpeticum friend’s child had "herpes in the skin ended up in hospital"  
No hx eczema or other chronic derm cond  
No known prev chickenpox vacc status uncertain "Mum reckons I had all my needles"  

Works childcare several kids recently with varicella one sent home with chickenpox last wk  
Not preg on COCP LMP ~2/52 ago regular  
Non smoker social EtOH wkends  

Pt quite tangential long digressions re work politics etc needed repeated redirection to clarify timeline

Meds  
- PRN paracetamol 500mg 1–2 tabs for HA  
Allergies

# Ix  
Typical primary varicella in well immunocompetent adult  
No routine bloods ordered tonight  
VZV PCR swab offered if dx uncertainty but not required clinically at this stage  

# Assessment  
1 Primary varicella infection adult 24F day ~3 of illness likely acquired @ childcare  
   Systemically mild currently  
   Nil features pneumonitis encephalitis hepatitis  
2 Painful rash skin tenderness > itch causing distress  
3 Health anxiety ↑ after online info  

# Plan  
- Start antiviral  
  • Valaciclovir 1g PO TDS 7/7 (no known renal issues) script given PBS  
  Discussed benefit best if started within 24h of rash but still some benefit in adults to ↓severity time off work pt keen  

- Analgesia  
  • Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
  • Advised avoid NSAIDs due ?↑ risk secondary skin infection  

- Skin care basic advice  
  Loose cotton clothing cool compresses gentle soap free wash pat dry  
  Keep nails short avoid picking scratching  

- Itch  
  If itch worsens suggested OTC non sedating antihist eg cetirizine 10mg nocte PRN  

- Infection control work  
  Infectious until all lesions crusted dry no new lesions ~5–7/7 from rash onset  
  Must stay away from childcare avoid close contact with preg women without known immunity newborns immunocomp contacts until then  
  Medical certificate provided to cover time off work  

- Education  
  Explained difference varicella vs eczema herpeticum reassurance current picture not c/w eczema herpeticum nil ocular involvement  
  Directed to reliable info eg Healthdirect NSW Health rather than random google  

# Safety net / red flags  
Emphasised clearly asked pt to repeat back key points due tangential style  
Urgent ED / OOH review if  
- ↑SOB pleuritic CP haemoptysis high fevers  
- Severe HA neck stiffness photophobia confusion drowsiness seizures new weakness difficulty walking  
- ↓oral intake signs dehydration (minimal urine dizziness very dry mouth)  
- Rapidly spreading redness warmth swelling or focal severe pain around lesions or pus  
- Any eye pain visual change vesicles on eye surface  

Pt verbalised understanding "if I feel really crook in the chest or head or my eyes get involved I go straight to hospital"  

# F/U  
Suggest r/v with regular GP (unknown name) within 2–3/7 to reassess rash and systemically  
Phone f/u ok for certificate extension if stable  
Once recovered suggest separate appt with usual GP to  
- check immunisation records and consider varicella zoster vacc hx  
- general preventive care incl cervical screening not covered today  

Time ~15 min acute problem focussed some preventive care deferred due to time and pt tangential hx
