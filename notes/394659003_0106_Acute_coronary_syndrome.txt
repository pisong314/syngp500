62M electrician  

CC: “bit dizzy + nauseous last few days, feel wiped out” + palps  

HPC  
4–5/7 intermittent light-headedness (pre-syncope esp on standing / fast walking) + nausea, 1x vomit y/day  
Exertional CP x2 this wk – “tightness across chest” 5–10 mins, walking fast / carrying gear → settles w rest. Assoc SOB, fatigue. No true syncope  
Palps 2–3/7, brief runs “heart racing” a few mins, mainly pm on site  
No fever, no focal neuro sx, no pleuritic pain, no calf sx  

Obs  
BP 148/92 HR 96 reg RR 18 SpO₂ 97% RA afebrile  
Overweight ~BMI 28  

CVS exam: dual HS, no murmur, no oedema, JVP not ↑  
Resp: clear  

ECG (in rooms): SR ~95. ~1mm horiz ST dep V4–6, II, aVF + T flattening lat leads → ?ischaemia / NSTEACS. No STE  

Imp  
1) ?ACS – likely NSTEACS (UA/NSTEMI)  
   Age + male + smoker + FHx + new exertional CP + SOB + nausea + concerning ECG → high risk. Time-critical  
2) Dizziness / nausea / palps likely part of ACS picture (no red flag focal neuro, no clear primary arrhythmia in rooms)  
3) CV risk – smoker, probable HTN, ?lipids (for later)  

Plan  
- Explained likely ACS, risk arrhythmia / MI / death if delay. Pt initially “just need something for nausea, got a meeting” but agreed to hosp after discussion  
- Aspirin 300mg PO stat (chewed) given here  
- O₂ not needed (sats 97% RA)  
- NBM until ED review  
- No GTN here as pain-free at rest during consult  

Disposition  
- 000 called → urgent transfer to tertiary ED w cardiology. Not safe to self-drive  
- Handover to ambos: ?NSTEACS, exertional CP, ECG changes, aspirin given, NKDA  
- ECG + brief referral printout sent w pt  
- Advised wife to meet at ED – pt to call from ambulance  

F/up  
GP review 1/52 post-discharge (or as per cardiology) for meds, risk factor work-up, cardiac rehab referral etc  
Safety net: attend ED / 000 if CP or collapse  

Billing: Level C, private, usual gap charged (busy clinic)
