Nil recent infective Sx nil calf pain or swelling nil recent immob surg or long haul travel

CVS HS I+II nil murmur JVP not ↑ periph pulses palpable symm nil oedema  
Resp chest clear AE good bilat  
Abdo soft NT  
Neuro AOx3 gait normal in room  
Brief walk test corridor 1–2min brisk walk → mild ↑dyspnoea reports little more tight across chest settles quickly when sits  

Ix in rooms  
ECG SR ~95 1–2mm horiz ST dep V4–V6 T wave flattening inf leads nil STE no prior ECG for comparison  
Cap BGL 6.1 mmol/L  

Assessment  
1 Suspected ACS likely NSTEACS NSTEMI vs unstable angina  
Presentation typical exertional chest tightness in 72yo male w autonomic Sx dizziness nausea clamminess fatigue + exertional dyspnoea and lateral ST dep on ECG  
Haemodynamically stable in rooms but exertional Sx persisting  
Given age FHx and ECG changes high pretest probability for NSTEACS as per national ACS guidelines requires urgent ED assess serial trops continuous monitoring and early cardiology input ± invasive angiography based on risk strat  

2 Dizziness nausea fatigue palpitations  
Most likely part of same ACS spectrum 2° transient myocardial ischaemia rather than primary vestibular GI or anxiety cause  
Nil focal neuro findings nil sepsis features nil evidence PE clinically nil arrhythmia on resting ECG  

Plan  
Given concern for ACS entire consult focussed on acute management and transfer other preventive issues deferred  

Immediate mgmt in surgery  
- Aspirin 300mg PO chewed given in rooms first dose pt not on antiplatelet previously nil hx GI bleed or allergy  
- Oxygen not indicated sats 96% RA  
- GTN withheld initially as minimal pain at rest plan to use if pain recurs while awaiting transfer  
- IV access not set up in this GP clinic ambulance to insert IV and commence ACS protocol en route  

Disposition  
000 called for urgent transfer to nearest tertiary ED w PCI capability  
Handover to paramedics  
72yo male new exertional chest tightness w assoc dizziness nausea fatigue brief episode yday + exertional Sx today  
ECG SR ~95 w 1–2mm horiz ST dep V4–V6 T wave flattening inf leads nil STE  
Post 300mg aspirin obs stable BP 148/86 HR 96 RR 16 SpO2 96% RA afebrile  
?NSTEACS needs serial hs trops cont cardiac monitoring anticoagulation as per hospital protocol and cardiology r/v  

Discussion w pt + wife  
Explained clinical concern that Sx + ECG may represent heart attack spectrum rather than multivitamin side effect or simple overexertion emphasised need for hospital tests incl troponin ECG monitoring possible angiogram early tx improves outcomes as per ACS guidelines  
Pt worried about wasting time reassured presentation appropriate for urgent assessment  
Briefly outlined if ACS confirmed likely need for long term meds eg aspirin second antiplatelet statin ACEi beta blocker and cardiac rehab after discharge  

Safety  
Advised pt not to drive ambulance transfer only  
Wife asked to take current meds including OTC to hospital  

F/U  
Plan GP r/v within 1/52 of hospital discharge or earlier if requested by hospital team  
Will obtain discharge summary and then address CV risk factors lipids BP vaccinations lifestyle etc at post hospital F/U  

Time  
Std consult → urgent complex assessment ECG interpretation explanation and coordination of transfer ~20min total  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Tan]  
ED called briefly to confirm arrival pt now pain free initial troponin pending they will admit under cardiology obs ward  
GP F/U post discharge reiterated in handover
