Impression  
1) L ear pain – likely mild OE / canal irritation, no AOM, no mastoiditis, low concern today  
2) Acute monoarthritis L knee – septic arthritis ↑↑ concern vs crystal arthropathy. Systemic sx + large hot effusion + unable WB. Needs urgent hosp  

Plan  
Ear  
– Reassured no serious ear pathology seen  
– Avoid cotton buds / water  
– Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day) – advised  

L knee – suspected septic arthritis  
– Discussed seriousness w pt (initially reluctant “I’ve put up with worse”) + wife. Explained risk joint destruction/sepsis if delay  
– Urgent ED referral for:  
  • Arthrocentesis → MCS + Gram stain + crystals  
  • Bloods: FBC, CRP/ESR, U&E, LFT, BCx  
  • Ortho review for possible urgent washout  
  • IV abx AFTER cultures as per hosp protocol / ID  
– No abx given here to avoid ↓ diagnostic yield (ED expecting him)  
– Phoned local ED – d/w ED reg, ortho team notified, accepted as ?septic knee  
– Printed referral (hx/exam + working dx septic arthritis L knee) sent w pt  
– Ambulance arranged due to pain + poor mobility + risk deterioration. Wife to accompany  

Safety  
– Pt verbalises understanding, agrees to transfer. Risks/benefits explained.  

F/up  
– Review here post-discharge for knee + ear, and to organise further work-up if not septic on hosp tests  
– Routine health check etc deferred – to book once acute issue resolved  

[No pathology ordered in GP today – ED to perform full work-up]
