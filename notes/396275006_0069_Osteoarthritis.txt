Review – back pain (ongoing)

72F, retired admin. Known OA knees/hands.

Came in mainly re: “my lower back’s been getting worse the last month or so”. ~3/12 low back pain, more noticeable x 4–6/52. Central / paraspinal lumbar ache, “deep stiffness”, worse standing/walking, better sitting/stretching. Morning stiffness ~10 mins then eases. Baseline 3/10, flares to 6/10. No clear injury – thinks maybe softer new mattress + long periods at computer emails.

No leg radiation, no pins/needles, no weakness. Denies saddle numbness, no bladder/bowel issues. No fevers, wt loss, night sweats, no waking from sleep with pain. Mobilising independently, just cutting back longer walks.

She’s taking Panadol 1 g mostly BD, up to TDS some days, partial help. Avoids oral NSAIDs “upset my stomach years ago”, no known ulcer/bleed. Using Voltaren gel on knees occasionally. Wants to avoid “strong painkillers”. Keen on “what else apart from more tablets”.

Husband in waiting room – she mentions he’s been nagging her to get it checked but otherwise coping at home.

PMHx: OA knees/hands, longstanding. No other chronic issues volunteered.
Meds: paracetamol up to 1 g TDS PRN; topical NSAID gel to knees intermittently.
Allergies: NKDA.

Obs: BP 132/76, HR 74 reg, RR 14, afebrile, SpO₂ 98% RA. BMI ~27.

Exam (focused):
Looks well, walking unaided. Mild tenderness lumbar paraspinals, no midline bony tenderness, ↓flex/extension due to pain. SLR neg bilat. LL neuro grossly normal (power, reflexes, sensation). Gait slightly antalgic initially then settles. Knees with mild OA changes, full ROM.

No red flags elicited (no trauma/cancer hx/systemic sx/neuro deficit/sphincter disturbance).

Impression:
– Mechanical low back pain – likely lumbar facet / degenerative OA in context of known OA elsewhere.  
– Generalised OA contributing to chronic pain but stable function.

Plan (bit all over but covered):
• Discussed likely age-related OA/degenerative cause, no features to suggest sinister pathology today. Reassured re typical slow progression.  
• Advised trial firmer mattress support and avoiding prolonged sitting (get up/stretch ~30–40 min).  
• Encouraged ongoing gentle activity, short walks, stretching – avoid full rest.

Meds:
• Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day) – suggested short regular course during flares rather than ad hoc.  
• Start topical diclofenac 1% gel to lumbar area: thin layer up to QID PRN, avoid broken skin, wash hands. PBS OTC anyway.  
• Oral NSAIDs deferred today given previous dyspepsia and current moderate control – option later short-term with PPI if needed.  
• No opioids – not indicated for OA back pain, pt agrees.

Referrals / tests:
• Physio referral – lumbar/core strengthening, posture advice, pacing. She will book locally.  
• Path: FBC, U&E, LFT, ESR/CRP ordered (S&N) as baseline / exclude inflammatory cause. Results to be checked before next appt – will call if anything unexpected.

No imaging today – explained X-ray/CT unlikely to change immediate management without red flags; she’s happy to trial conservative measures first.

Briefly touched on weight – she raised “should I lose a couple of kilos?” Agreed helpful for joints, will address more systematically next visit (time).

Safety-net: return sooner if worsening pain esp at night, new leg weakness/numbness, bladder/bowel changes, systemic symptoms. Otherwise review 4/52 to assess physio response + review bloods, reconsider imaging/meds then.
