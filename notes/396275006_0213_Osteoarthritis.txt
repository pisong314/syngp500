Bulk bill GP walk in clinic  
Initial consult new pt  

Reason for visit  
C/O knees "giving way" joint instability x several mths  

History of presenting complaint  
Pt is 72F Anglo‑Australian retired retail worker new to this practice  
Presents alone today  

Knees  
Long Hx knee pain "for years" gradual onset previously told "wear and tear"  
Last ~6–9/12 notes intermittent giving way both knees R>L esp going down steps getting up from chair  
3–4 near falls last 2/12 nil definite complete fall nil head strike  
Pain dull ache medial + ant knees worse walking >10–15min stairs prolonged standing eg cooking eased by rest sitting  
Occasional night pain not waking most nights  
Stiff after sitting >20–30min + on waking loosens after few mins moving  
Swelling "puffy" end of day nil redness nil warmth  
Marked crepitus "crack and grind all the time"  
Feels wobbly "like theyll buckle" nil true locking nil episodes of giving way with sharp severe pain  

Background OA  
Hx dx "arthritis in my knees and hands" by prev GP yrs ago thinks XR done "ages ago" records not available here  
Hands intermittent pain + stiffness esp DIP/PIP with heavy use bony nodules at fingertips no acute flare today  

Falls / instability  
Uses banister on stairs nil walking aid  
Nil dizziness syncope chest pain palps new neuro sx  
Nil recent trauma infection or systemic sx  

Analgesia / self mgmt  
OTC paracetamol 1 g approx once daily PRN "does nothing"  
OTC ibuprofen intermittently dose unclear "take a few when the pain’s awful"  
Nil regular topical tx nil physio nil structured exercise  
Walks "abit around the shops" otherwise fairly sedentary since retirement  

Pt beliefs / consultation dynamics  
Attributes sx to "cheap mattress" "chemicals in food"  
Strong belief deterioration 2° COVID vax "ever since they did the COVID jabs my joints have gone downhill" despite explanation of OA pathophys  
Pt argumentative frequently interrupts "youre wrong I know my body" "that’s not what the internet says"  
Repeatedly requests "proper scans and some decent painkillers not Panadol"  
Hostile tone at times though remains in room answers focused Qs  

Family input  
No family present today pt states daughter "reckons I should get new knees" but not keen on surgery herself  

Past medical Hx  
OA knees + hands longstanding clinical  
Nil known inflammatory arthritis CTD signif joint trauma or prev meniscectomy  
Other PMHx not fully explored today pt very focused on joints time limited advised longer r/v for full PMHx + meds  

Meds  
Self directed  
– Paracetamol up to ~1 g/day PRN  
– OTC ibuprofen PRN "few tablets" schedule unclear  
No regular prescribed meds disclosed to clarify at next visit  

Allergies  
NKDA (per pt)  

FHx  
Mother "bad arthritis" later life had hip replacement  
Nil known rheumatoid arthritis  

SHx  
Lives alone in own unit independent ADLs but shopping housework harder due knee pain  
Retired retail with many yrs prolonged standing  
Nil regular exercise  
Smoking EtOH not covered adequately today to r/v  
On age pension cost an issue prefers bulk billed low cost options  

ROS (targeted)  
Nil fevers wt loss night sweats  
Nil rash eye inflam inflammatory back pain  
Nil bowel or bladder incontinence nil saddle anaesthesia  
Nil peripheral paraesthesia or focal weakness apart from subjective "wobbly knees"  

Exam  
General  
Elderly woman BMI ~30–32 overweight mobile but cautious mildly irritable frequently challenging explanations  

Obs  
BP 136/78 HR 78 reg RR 16 afebrile SpO₂ 98% RA  

Gait  
Slight antalgic gait short stride slow pace nil aid cautious turning mild varus knees  

Knees  
Mild bony enlargement bilat slight varus nil erythema  
Small effusions B knees R>L  
Mild tenderness medial joint lines B nil warmth  
Nil obvious lig laxity on valgus/varus stress 0° + 30°  
ROM flexion to ~110° with end range pain extension near full marked crepitus through range  
McMurray neg for click/locking some medial discomfort only  
Nil post tenderness nil calf swelling  

Hands  
Heberden nodes several DIP some PIP nodes mild tenderness nil synovial thickening nil warmth deformity ROM preserved slight discomfort end range  

Neuro LL  
Power 5/5 major muscle groups sensation LT intact reflexes normal nil focal deficit  

Ix  
None available today prev XR results not on file  
Plan to obtain bilateral knee XR AP lateral weight bearing as below  

Assessment  
1 Bilateral knee OA clinically likely mod with subjective instability / giving way and functional limitation  
   Features consistent with degenerative OA long Hx mechanical pain stiffness short lived morning + after rest bony enlargement crepitus small effusions R>L  
   Nil red flags for acute internal derangement (nil locking nil discrete trauma nil gross lig laxity) or inflammatory arthritis  
   Instability likely multifactorial pain quadriceps weakness OA related mechanical change rather than acute structural failure  
2 Hand OA mild today stable  
3 ↑ falls risk related to knee OA deconditioning though nil actual falls yet nil neuro cause evident  
4 Challenging therapeutic alliance pt strongly prefers imaging + stronger analgesia sceptical of conservative mgmt likely adherence issues  

Plan  
Discussed dx  
Explained clinical picture most consistent with OA rather than acute lig tear  
Discussed usual OA course role of muscle strength wt in joint stability that XR often does not change mgmt early though can help confirm severity + future surgical planning  
Pt repeatedly ? this requested MRI  

Ix  
– Bilateral knee XR AP lateral weight bearing requested today to assess severity exclude other pathology eg advanced unicompartmental disease chondrocalcinosis  
   Explained MBS criteria MRI not first line in typical OA without locking or acute injury pt unhappy but agreed to XR "for now"  

Meds / analgesia  
– Paracetamol advised trial regular dosing for short period 1 g up to QID PRN max 4 g/24h use lowest effective dose avoid exceeding limit  
– Topical NSAID suggested diclofenac 1% gel to knees up to QID OTC explained lower systemic risk vs oral NSAIDs and relatively low cost  
– Oral NSAIDs discussed only as possible next step for flares if no contraindications will defer until full PMHx meds and renal/GI risk clarified  
   Pt frustrated "Panadol and creams dont work" explained safety concerns of starting regular oral NSAIDs or stronger analgesia without full background  
– Clarified opioids not appropriate 1st line for chronic OA signif risk depn falls constipation etc pt disagreed referencing internet nil opioid prescribed  

Non pharmacological  
– Education re OA common at her age often slowly progressive sx can fluctuate emphasised joints not "collapsing" that strength wt mgmt activity pacing can ↓ pain and improve function  
– Exercise / physio recommended gentle regular programme focus quads + hip strengthening + general conditioning gait + balance work  
   Offered physio referral and option EPC / GPMP if criteria met pt sceptical "physio was a waste of time" previously but will "maybe think about it" after XR  
– Wt mgmt briefly raised modest wt loss >5% can ↓ knee load and pain pt defensive "Im not that big" did not pursue in depth this visit escalating tension  
– Activity pacing suggested breaking housework into shorter bouts with rests avoiding prolonged standing using railings on stairs trolley for shopping etc  

Falls / safety  
Advised care on stairs use handrails avoid carrying heavy loads down steps  
Discussed option walking stick esp outdoors for stability pt dismissive "Im not an old cripple" left for future r/v  
Advised to attend urgently if actual fall head strike new neuro sx sudden severe knee pain locking red hot swollen joint  

Follow up  
– R/V 1–2/52 with knee XR results  
   • reassess pain function near falls  
   • if XR shows mod–severe OA and conservative measures inadequate consider  
        – trial oral NSAID if safe (after full PMHx meds review UECs FBC LFTs if indicated)  
        – formal physio referral  
        – if severe structural disease with significant functional limitation despite adequate conservative mgmt over time discuss ortho ref for possible TKR  
– Asked pt to bring any old imaging reports and full med list to next appt  
– Suggested separate longer appt for comprehensive health check CVD risk vaccs lifestyle etc pt non committal "fix the joints first"  

Time  
Consult largely taken up with Hx explanation of OA addressing repeated requests for MRI / strong painkillers other preventive issues deferred to later visit
