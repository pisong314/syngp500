22/11/25 Telehealth video (metro Syd) Std consult ~15 min  

72F (ret office admin) known OA knees/hands  
CC: wants Xray + bloods "checked" re knees/hands. Worried "too much gardening" + "using my phone too much" is "wearing the joints out faster".  

HPC  
Gradual ↑ knee pain 12–18/12 R>L dull ache worse pm / post walking/standing → better rest/heat  
AM stiff <15 mins "bit creaky"  
Intermittent eve swelling knees, no redness, no locking/giving way  
Hands: DIP/PIP pain + bony "knobbly bits" esp index/middle fingers. Worse after gardening / tablet use. Concerned "I'll wear them down to bone on bone"  
No true night/rest pain. No systemic Sx (no fevers wt loss NS)  
Function ok ADLs, ↓ long walks, avoids stairs, still gardening but shorter sessions  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1 g up to TDS PRN (usually 1–2 doses busy days)  
Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN ~1–2x/month, no dyspepsia  
Vit D + multivit OTC  
NKDA  

Telehealth obs (limited)  
Well, NAD on screen, talking in full sentences  
Stands/walks into frame, mild antalgic gait favour R knee  
Hands: visible DIP bony swellings c/w Heberden’s. No obvious erythema via video  
Knees: no obvious deformity/large effusion on video  

Ix reviewed (XR 1/52 ago)  
Bilateral knees: mild–mod tricompartmental OA, medial > lat, JSN + small osteophytes. No #, no chondrocalcinosis, no large effusion  
Hands PA: OA DIP/PIP w osteophytes + JSN esp index/middle bilat. Early 1st CMC OA mild JSN + small osteophytes. No erosions / no infl features  
Bloods (last review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – updated this month): FBE, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR all N. Uric acid N  

A  
1) OA knees (mild–mod) + hands (DIP/PIP, early 1st CMC) – clinical + XR. No red flags for inflammatory/infective arthritis. Pain mild–mod, intermittent, some functional impact but ADLs intact. Pt a bit "worried well" re long-term outlook  
2) Overweight by hx (BMI ~29–30 last F2F 6/12 ago) contributing to knee Sx  

P  
– Reassured re XR: not end-stage, not "bone on bone". Explained OA = common age-related wear, keeping active helpful, not harmful  
– Encourage cont low impact ex (walking as tol, can split into shorter walks). Avoid complete rest  
– Basic knee strength ex + hand joint protection discussed briefly (avoid prolonged tight grip, pacing w gardening/tablet). Will email Arthritis Aust / painHEALTH links  
– Analgesia:  
   • Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day) – ok to use more regularly on flare days  
   • Start topical NSAID: diclofenac 1% gel to knees + painful hand joints up to QID PRN – eRx sent  
   • Oral NSAIDs: ok to keep ibuprofen intermittently with food, min effective dose, avoid regular use given age/risks  
   • No opioids indicated  
– Footwear: advised better cushioned/supportive walkers (not worn supermarket runners)  
– Wt: brief chat re gradual wt ↓ (even few kg) to help knees – pt open, will address more at F2F  

– Allied health:  
   • Physio F2F for exercise programme / gait / strength – to organise under CDM if Sx/limit ↑ at next in-person review  
   • OT for hand OA mentioned; pt prefers to trial ex + gel first  

Safety net  
RTC/ED if acute ↑ pain/swelling/redness/warmth in joint, locking/giving way, marked loss of function, or systemic Sx (fever, wt loss etc)  

F/U  
Book F2F 4–6/52: review response to topical NSAID + ex, do full joint exam, vitals, BMI, consider CDM + formal physio/OT refs, also pt wants "everything checked – bones, heart, the lot" → do chronic disease / routine health check then  
Earlier review (telehealth or F2F) if deterioration  

[Addendum 16:30 – same day: eRx diclofenac gel confirmed sent to usual pharmacy]
