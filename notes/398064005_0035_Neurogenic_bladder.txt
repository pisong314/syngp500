HPC  
Known neurogenic bladder 2° MS + prior pelvic malignancy tx (hysterectomy + chemoRT ~7yrs ago per file)  
On oxybutynin 5 mg BD for several yrs usually good control now out of meds  
Last 2–3/52 notes ↑daytime frequency voiding ~q1–1.5h vs usual 2–3h  
Nocturia now 2–3x vs baseline 1–2x  
Mild urgency nil incontinence  
Nil dysuria haematuria flank pain fevers rigors N+V loin pain  
Stream ok nil hesitancy nil sense of incomplete emptying nil visible lower abdo swelling nil leakage between voids  

Prev intermittent self cath under urology ceased ~18/12 ago when residuals ↓ has not restarted nil IDC currently  

Very anxious re malignancy MS “I’m worried this could be cancer again” “Are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests”  
Has been googling neurogenic bladder recurrence cancer tap water “toxins” and bladder irritation drinking ↑herbal teas “to flush things out” wonders if bladder “overworked”  

Nil new back pain saddle anaesthesia leg weakness or change in baseline MS sx  
Bowels daily soft occasional mild constipation uses prn coloxyl  

Past Hx (relevant)

Examination  
Gen anxious but coherant engaging repeatedly seeks reassurance re cancer  
Obs BP 126/78 HR 78 RR 14 afebrile 36.7°C SpO2 99% RA  
Abdo soft NT nil suprapubic tenderness nil palpable bladder nil masses  
CVS chest S1S2 normal chest clear  
Neuro brief screen gait with baseline mild unsteadiness from MS nil new focal deficit  
Nil CVA tenderness  

Ix today  
Urine dipstick SG 1.015 pH 6 trace leucocytes nitrite neg nil blood nil protein nil glucose overall not c/w UTI  

Assessment  
1 Neurogenic bladder with mild ↑frequency/urgency  
   Likely fluctuation of underlying neurogenic bladder MS rather than new pathology  
   No clinical features of acute retention UTI pyelo ureteric obs or renal failure  

2 Health anxiety  
   Marked preoccupation with cancer recurrence MS progression interpreting minor bladder change catastrophically  
   Recent oncology R/V reassuring  

3 Hx pelvic malignancy MS  
   Stable by Hx and exam nil red flags for recurrence or spinal cord compression  

Differential dx  
– Flare of neurogenic bladder / detrusor overactivity  
– Early UTI (less likely given dipstick sx pattern)  
– Radiation cystitis chronic fluctuation  
– Anxiety contributing to ↑perception of urinary sx  
– Much less likely malignancy recurrence upper tract obstruction spinal cord lesion given nil red flags exam normal recent specialist R/V  

Plan  

# Neurogenic bladder / urinary sx  
– Restart oxybutynin 5 mg BD PBS  
  Discussed option to ↑ to 5 mg TDS after 1–2/52 if sx persist and well tolerated  
  Counselled re anticholinergic SE dry mouth constipation blurred vision urinary retention confusion advised to ↓dose or seek r/v if problematic  
– Given mild ↑nocturia and herbal tea intake advised ↓evening fluids esp herbal teas after ~1800 bladder training timed voids aiming 2–3 hourly rather than “just in case”  
– Ix ordered  
  • MSU for MCS (given trace leucocytes neurogenic bladder hx) treat only if clear UTI  
  • UEC eGFR to monitor renal function in context long‑standing neurogenic bladder + prior pelvic RT  
– Discussed currently nil indication for urgent imaging  
  No pain haematuria systemic sx or known renal impairment  
  If UEC abn or sx persist/worsen over next 4–6/52 will consider renal tract USS ± urology re‑r/v  

Safety net  
– Advised to seek urgent care/ED if acute urinary retention painful lower abdo distension visible haematuria fever rigors flank/loin pain confusion or sudden neuro change leg weakness saddle anaesthesia loss of bladder/bowel control  

# Health anxiety  
– Validated concerns explained that online info can ↑anxiety “Dr Google makes me feel worse” per pt  
– Provided clear explanation of why current picture not suggestive of cancer recurrence or new MS relapse emphasised recent oncology NED and stable neuro exam  
– Suggested dedicated long appt to focus on anxiety coping strategies chronic condition management poss MHCP + psych ref pt a bit hesitant but agreeable to consider “I just want to make sure we’re not missing anything”  

Follow up  
– F/U 1–2/52 to  
  • review sx response to oxybutynin  
  • check MSU UEC results  
  • reassess need for imaging / urology  
– Ask reception to book long consult in next 2–3/52 for health anxiety + chronic disease r/v MS cancer survivorship bladder mgmt  

Ongoing care  
– Continue neurology and oncology f/ups as arranged
