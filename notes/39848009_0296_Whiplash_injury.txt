Follow up after MVA / “motor symptoms”  

34F, office worker, rear-ended ~4–5 wks ago, seen ED same day (whiplash, no imaging, C-spine cleared), saw GP here ~2 wks post for neck pain. Lost physio referral.  

Today mainly: ongoing neck pain + “weird motor things” in arms/legs. Very vague with dates, keeps changing story about when it started (“maybe last week, maybe straight after crash”).  

Sx:
- Neck pain midline + paraspinal, into R shoulder, 4–7/10, worse end of workday, sitting at computer, driving.  
- Intermittent heaviness / “shaky, clumsy” feeling R arm > L, sometimes R leg. Episodes mins–1 hr, several times/day. Still able to type and lift light things but “feels off”.  
- Intermittent tingling R forearm/hand, not clearly dermatomal. No numbness, no saddle anaesthesia, no bowel/bladder change.  
- Occipital HAs a few times/wk since crash, with neck stiffness, no red flag HA features volunteered.  
- Still working full-time, slower with typing, avoids heavier lifting. Sleep broken by neck pain.  
- Quite preoccupied with “nerve damage”, repeats questions, poor recall of prior advice/meds.  

PMHx: none documented. No regular meds. Unsure what pain tablets she’s used (“little white pills – maybe Panadol or Nurofen”). NKDA recorded. Non-smoker.  

Exam:  
Obs normal: BP 118/74, HR 78, afebrile, sats 99% RA. Looks well, walks in unaided.  
Neck: Tender lower C-spine + paraspinals, ↑ tone trapezii. Mildly ↓ ROM all directions from pain. No deformity/step.  
Neuro UL/LL:  
- Power 5/5 throughout, no drift  
- Tone normal  
- Reflexes 2+ and symmetrical, no clonus  
- Sensation intact to LT/pin; she says R forearm “feels a bit funny” at times but no objective deficit  
- Coord normal (FNF, heel–shin), gait incl. tandem normal  
- Hoffmann’s, Babinski neg.  

No signs of cervical myelopathy or focal radiculopathy today.  

Impression:  
- Subacute whiplash-associated neck pain with muscle spasm, >4 wks post MVA, no red flags.  
- Nonspecific R> L arm ± leg sensory/motor complaints but normal neuro exam – likely part of post-whiplash sensorimotor disturbance + anxiety, no evidence of cord/root compression at present.  
- Health anxiety re “nerve damage” contributing.  

Plan (limited time, focused on neck + neuro):  
- Explained exam reassuring: no objective weakness, reflexes/gait normal, no myelopathy signs.  
- No C-spine imaging ordered – discussed not indicated without red flags or objective deficit.  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (max 4 g/day).  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg PO TDS PRN with food, short courses only if needed, no other NSAIDs.  
  Asked her to bring names/boxes of any meds next visit as recall poor.  
- Neck exercises – gave printed sheet, briefly demonstrated. Encouraged to keep moving neck within comfort, avoid prolonged static posture at desk.  
- New referral to local physiotherapist (postural work, strengthening). Suggested she photograph referral so doesn’t lose it.  
- Advised to book longer review if ongoing anxiety/feeling “jumpy in the car” etc – will need separate mental health focus.  

Red flags: advised urgent review/ED if new limb weakness, difficulty walking, loss of bladder/bowel control, saddle numbness, sudden severe headache or other neuro sx, or systemically unwell with neck pain.  

Follow up:  
- Review 2–3 wks with usual GP to reassess pain and any change in neuro sx, and check physio attendance.  
- Earlier if worsens or analgesia not enough.

Re-read ED summary in Best Practice – confirms no LOC, no imaging, dx “whiplash”, discharged with simple analgesia only. No previous psych dx noted. No further action now, plan above stands.
