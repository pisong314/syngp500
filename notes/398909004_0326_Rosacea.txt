A  
1) Rosacea – papulopustular on erythematotelangiectatic background. Persistent activity likely non-adherence rather than tx failure. No ocular or phymatous features  
2) Non-adherence to tx / missed f/up – ongoing  
3) Mild dyslipidaemia – incidental, not addressed in detail today  

P  
Rosacea  
- Re-discussed chronic relapsing nature, need for consistent tx, avoid topical steroids (pt denies use)  
- Triggers briefly – advised ↓ alcohol esp red wine, heat, harsh products  

Meds  
1) Oral  
   - Restart doxycycline 50 mg PO mane x 6/52  
   - Counselling: take with water, stay upright, photosensitivity → sunscreen; cease/see GP if pregnant or severe ADR  

2) Topical  
   - Start ivermectin 1% cream OD thin layer to affected facial areas (PBS)  
   - If not tolerated → back to metro gel but avoid chopping/changing  

3) Erythema  
   - Brimonidine gel discussed for occasional “special events” use only (rebound risk) – not prescribing today, keep simple  

Eyes  
- No ocular rosacea currently → advise RTC if new redness, persistent grittiness, photophobia, ↓ vision  

Adherence  
- Suggested link doxy to breakfast, phone reminders, cream by bathroom sink  
- Explained stop–start pattern = ↓ benefit, longer flare. Pt: "I’ll try, but I’m pretty hopeless"  

Lipids  
- Very brief lifestyle chat only today  
- Plan dedicated CV risk appt later for full review  

F/up  
- Review 6/52 re rosacea + adherence, earlier if worse, eye sx, or doxy SE (GI, severe photosensitivity, headache/visual changes)  
- Book longer appt next 2–3/12 for cholesterol, prevention, contraception discussion  

Time: Std consult, mainly results + rosacea mgmt, other issues deferred.
