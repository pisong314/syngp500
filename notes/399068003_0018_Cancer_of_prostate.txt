Beliefs / concerns  
Feels current 2nd floor unit 2 flights stairs no lift “is making my cancer worse”  
“climbing those stairs every day must be putting pressure on the tumour”

Difficulties  
- Climbing 2 flights stairs esp with groceries multiple stops signif pain  
- Standing to cook >10–15min  
- Walking >100m without rest due to back / hip pain  
Pt request “I want you to write that I’m not fit for any stairs and I can’t do any work at all”

A:  
1 Metastatic prostate Ca to bone per pt clinically stable today  
   - Nil red flag features of cord compression  
   - Bone pain mod impacts mobility esp stairs distance walking  
2 Chronic cancer related LBP + B hip pain partly controlled on simple analgesia  
   - Functionally limiting but indep basic ADLs  
3 Functional limitation re current housing  
   - Difficulty with 2 flights stairs esp carrying loads ↓exercise tolerance

4 Admin  
   - Housing / Centrelink medical form re disability / priority housing completed as able today  

P:  

Prostate Ca / pain  
- Explained cannot state “unable to climb any stairs at all” as requested  
  Will document metastatic Ca with chronic bone pain stairs and walking >50–100m ↑pain requires rests  
  Indep personal care but limited heavier tasks shopping stairs with loads  
- Analgesia  
  - Advised regular paracetamol 1g QID max 4g/24h rather than PRN missed doses  
  - Discussed cautious short course NSAID only with food avoid if renal / GI issues will recheck once bloods and past hx available  
  - Consider step up analgesia eg low dose opioid or neuropathic agent pending next r/v and results  
- Discussed option pain clinic / palliative care for sx control and support  
  Pt “not ready for palliative that means it’s the end”  
  Brief education re palliative ≠ just end of life pt will think about it
