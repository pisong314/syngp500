72M f/up mood re Ca  

Hx  
Known prostate Ca (locally adv, ?nodes, no bone mets on last letter). On ADT – leuprorelin depot IM q3/12 via public uro/onc. No RT/chemo recorded. Next uro review ~6/52.  

Mood ↓ last “couple of months” temporally around last ADT inj / mate unwell. Tangential, hard to keep on task.  
Core: low mood most days, ↓interest (stopped bowls last 4–6/52), ↓energy, slight ↓appetite (no wt loss), poor conc, some guilt/“burden” thoughts. Still enjoys grandkids.  
No SI/HI, no plan, says “not the sort to do anything silly”.  
Anx re prognosis + wife if he “goes first”.  

Thinks ADT contributing (“that hormone needle takes all the man out of you”). Also sedentary, watching news etc.  

PHQ‑9 today 14 (mod) – no red flag Q9.  

O/E  
BP 132/76 HR 76 RR 14 SpO2 98% RA afeb. Looks mildly flat but engages, tangential. No psychosis. Oriented.  

Dx  
1) Major depressive episode – mod severity in context prostate Ca + ADT  
2) Prostate Ca on ADT – appears clinically stable today, no new red flag sx (no bone pain, no wt loss, LUTS baseline)  

Plan  
– Discussed dx + likely multifactorial (Ca, ADT, ↓activity). Pt keen to “try something + talk to someone”  
– Start sertraline 25mg mane x1/52 then ↑ to 50mg mane if tol  
   • counselled re GI upset, sleep change, sexual SE, delayed onset 2–4/52  
   • warned re any mood deterioration / new SI → urgent review / ED  
– Labs: FBC, U&E, LFT, CMP incl Na ordered (SN path) – baseline prior to SSRI up‑titration (hyponaet risk) – to do with next Ca bloods if poss  
– MHCP: will book long appt in 1/52 to complete GP MHTP + refer to local psych (Better Access, CBT/supportive)  
– Encourage re‑engage with some activity (short walks, bowls club even if just social) – brief only  
– Involve wife next visit (pt agreeable)  

Safety  
No current SI, good protective factors (wife, grandkids, future‑oriented re “getting cancer sorted”). Given brief verbal safety net: RTC/SD review if mood worse, SI, SE from meds, or new Ca sx (bone pain, wt loss, LUTS change).  

F/up  
– 1/52 long appt: review sertraline tol, check mood/risk, do MHTP + psych referral, give path form if not already done  
– Then 4–6/52 review – repeat PHQ‑9, adjust dose PRN  
– Uro f/up ~6/52 as planned – asked to bring letters/results next time  

(Deferred today: knee aches, “chemicals in tap water” – advised separate std appt)
