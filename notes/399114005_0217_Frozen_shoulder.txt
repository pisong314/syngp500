Pt  
72F Greek‑Australian  retired factory worker  first visit to this clinic walk in  

C/O  
Bad headache x 3/7  
Also ongoing L shoulder stiffness pain  

HPC – headache  
Gradual onset 3/7 dull constant frontal and bitemporal R>L 7/10  
Worse evenings  not waking from sleep  
Nil thunderclap  not “worst ever”  
Nil N/V  nil photophobia or phonophobia  mild light sens only  nil visual aura

Nil recent head trauma  no new meds  
BP “usually a bit high” per pt  

Pt expectations / behaviour  
Quite demanding impatient wants quick outcome  
Quotes “my usual doctor always sends me for a brain scan when I get this”  
“I need a CT today I cant muck around”  
Also pushing for “strong painkillers” and shoulder injection today  
Needed repeated explanation re red flags why CT not indicated today  queries clinical decisions but eventually agrees to plan  

PMHx  
T2DM >10yrs per pt  last HbA1c unknown  says hasn’t seen usual GP for “few months”  
Prev ischaemic stroke ~5yrs ago  mild R arm weakness initially now resolved per pt  nil known carotid surg  
Hypertension ?duration  on “BP tablets the white one”  
Frozen shoulder L ~8–9/12  initially very painful now mainly stiff  
  Can’t lift arm to comb hair or hang washing  sleep disturbed as can’t lie on L  
  Tried physio previously “made it worse” stopped  now keen for “cortisone injection to fix it quickly”  
Nil known thyroid dx  nil recent neurosurg  

Meds (pt recall only)  
Metformin “big white one” BD  
Gliclazide MR ?OD  
Unspecified BP tablet  
“Blood thinner after my stroke” ?aspirin vs clopidogrel  takes “most days”  
PRN paracetamol  
Nil regular NSAIDs  

Allergies  
NKDA  

SHx  
Lives w husband  adult kids nearby supportive  
Non smoker  rare EtOH  
Greek first language  conversational English OK some health literacy gaps  sometimes uses daughter to translate elsewhere  
Bulk billing convenient  

O/E  
Vitals  BP 152/84 sitting R arm  HR 78 reg  RR 16  Temp 36.8°C  SpO₂ 98% RA  

Gen  
Alert orientated  mildly uncomfortable  not toxic  anxious impatient  

Neuro  
GCS 15  
CN II–XII grossly intact  fields full to confrontation  PERL  EOMI nil nystagmus  
Face sym  speech normal nil dysarthria or aphasia  
Motor  5/5 all limbs except L shoulder limited by pain/stiffness only  nil other focal weakness  
Sensation LT intact  
Coord finger–nose heel–shin intact  
Gait normal  nil ataxia  
Nil meningism  full neck flexion painless  

Head/ENT  
Scalp non tender  nil temporal artery tenderness or thickening  jaw opening painless  
Ears OP NAD  

CVS/Resp  
HS dual no added sounds  lungs clear  

MSK – L shoulder (brief)  
No deformity or swelling  
Diffuse anterolateral tenderness  
Global ↓ROM active + passive esp ER and abduction  painful at end range  IR also ↓  
Nil focal bony tenderness over clavicle ACJ humeral head  
Overall c/w adhesive capsulitis  

Ix today  
Nil bloods today (time limited focus on acute issue) – plan full chronic disease workup at later long appt  
L shoulder Xray AP + lateral/axillary ordered via Sullivan Nicolaides  to r/o sig OA calcific tendinopathy other bony pathology prior to injection consideration  
CT brain not ordered  not clinically indicated  

Current results  
Old results not available in our system today  pt thinks last diabetes bloods “ages ago”  no HbA1c trend to review  

Assessment  
1. Headache  likely tension type or non specific headache  possibly related to eyestrain + stress  
   No red flags on hx or exam  nil features to suggest acute stroke TIA SAH meningitis temporal arteritis intracranial infection or space occupying lesion today  
   Given age 72 and h/o ischaemic stroke  vascular causes considered carefully but current picture appears low risk  

2. Adhesive capsulitis L shoulder  in frozen/stiff phase  significant impact on ADLs and sleep  long standing  T2DM a strong RF  

3. T2DM >10yrs  monitoring suboptimal  meds unclear  likely ↑ vascular risk and ↑ risk of frozen shoulder  will need structured r/v  HbA1c lipids renal etc  

4. Hx ischaemic stroke  currently neuro stable  headache not c/w new cerebrovascular event  but ongoing secondary prevention needs review  

Plan  

Headache  
Explained likely benign tension type picture given gradual onset  stable pattern  normal neuro exam  
Discussed red flag Sx warranting urgent ED  
  Sudden severe “thunderclap”  
  New neuro deficits  weakness facial droop speech/vision change imbalance  
  Fever neck stiffness confusion sz vomiting ↓conscious state  
Reassured pt that immediate CT today not indicated  discussed radiation exposure and risk of incidental findings  pt initially unhappy but accepted after explanaton  
Analgesia  
  Advise regular paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/day w food  
  Suggested topical NSAID (diclofenac gel) to neck/shoulder tension if skin intact  OTC  
Non pharm  
  Encourage hydration  regular breaks from screens/TV  avoid prolonged exposure to bright supermarket LEDs if clear trigger  
Safety net  
  If headache ↑ severity  changes character  or any red flag Sx → ED  
  Otherwise RTC earlier if concerned  

Frozen shoulder L  
Provided brief education re natural hx  often self limiting  can last 18–24/12  current phase mainly stiffness w end range pain  
Explained that no therapy guaranteed to shorten total duration but can improve pain and function  
Pt strongly requesting immediate “cortisone injection today”  
Discussed  
  Prefer image guided intra articular injection for best accuracy and safety  
  Likely short term improvement only  not cure or major change to long term course  
  Need to consider transient ↑BSL in context of T2DM  
Plan  
  L shoulder Xray as above  
  Continue simple analgesia incl topical NSAID  
  Gentle home ROM within comfort  avoid aggressive stretching that worsens pain  
  Arrange long r/v after imaging to go through options in more detail  including possible US guided GH joint steroid injection (radiology / sports med) if still very limited and pt understands risks/benefits  
  Physio discussed  pt sceptical due to prior experience  suggested may reconsider once pain better controlled  

Diabetes / vascular risk  
Explained link between T2DM prior stroke and both frozen shoulder and vascular risk generally  
Advised need for separate chronic disease r/v  
Planned at future long appt  
  Full med reconciliation  confirm metformin dose  gliclazide MR  antiplatelet agent  consider statin if not already  optimise antihypertensives  
  Path (QML/SNP) – HbA1c  UEC  LFT  lipids  FBC  TSH  urine ACR  
  BP trend to be checked  target <130/80 given stroke hx if tolerated  
Pt wanted to “do everything now”  explained time constraints in busy walk in setting and need for safe thorough review  pt eventually agreed to separate longer appt  

Meds today  
No new scripts issued  
Recc  
  Paracetamol 1g QID PRN for headache/shoulder  
  OTC topical diclofenac gel to L shoulder/neck PRN  
Did not prescribe opioids or “strong painkillers”  discussed limited benefit and ↑risk esp in older pt w comorbidities  pt questioned but accepted after discussion  

Referrals  
Deferred today pending imaging and diabetes r/v  
  Possible future ref for US guided GH steroid injection (radiology / sports med)  
  Possible physio for structured ROM program once pain better controlled  

F/U  
1/7 standard appt  
  Check headache course  
  Review shoulder Xray results  
2–3/52 long appt (20–30min)  
  Comprehensive T2DM and vascular risk review incl meds and bloods  
  Detailed frozen shoulder mx plan consider ref for image guided injection  
Safety net reiterated  ED if sudden severe headache neuro Sx or systemic features  

Learning / reflection  
Complex consult in walk in context  significant time spent on expectation management esp around imaging and opioids  
Would like to read further re evidence for hydrodilatation vs steroid injection alone in diabetic adhesive capsulitis before next r/v  

Plan discussed w supervisor during/after consult  

[Supervisor addendum – Dr ______ 16:40]  
Reviewed case w registrar  72F w 3/7 non specific headache  exam entirely reassuring  agree low suspicion for acute intracranial pathology or GCA  CT brain not indicated at this stage  safety netting appropriate  
Adhesive capsulitis likely given global ↓ROM esp ER and DM hx  agree w plan for Xray then consider image guided steroid injection rather than blind injection in rooms  
Support deferring full diabetes and secondary prevention review to longer dedicated appt   
Overall assessment and mx plan appropriate  will co sign
