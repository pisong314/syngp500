72F vertigo  

Hx  
- Long hx vertigo / “vestibular neuritis” dx in ED per pt ~18/12 ago  
- Ongoing intermittent spinning esp getting out of bed, looking up/quick turns, secs–mins, several/day + nausea no vomit  
- “I want a proper ear balance specialist and an MRI today I can’t wait”  
- No new focal neuro by hx: -ve diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, limb wk, numb, VF loss  
- -ve acute hearing loss, -ve unilateral tinnitus, -ve aural fullness  
- Known postural hypotension – “bit woozy when I stand up too quick”, no recent falls but near misses  
- Using Epley-type manoeuvres off YouTube “just makes me dizzy”  
- Very fixated on ENT/MRI, not keen on physio/exercises “I just want this sorted”  

PMHx (relevant)  
- Vertigo / vestibular neuritis (old ED dx, no report)  
- Postural hypotension  
- HTN, HLD  
- No known AF / CVA / TIA / IHD in file  

Meds  
- Perindopril 5 mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte  
- Prochlorperazine 5 mg tds PRN vertigo – using few times/wk  

Allergies: NKDA  

O/E (phone only)  
- No vitals  
- Talking full sentences, clear speech, no obvious dysarthria  
- Oriented, coherent hx  
- Denies current vertigo during call  
- Denies new focal neuro sx, no new headache  

Ix  
- No acute ix ordered today (tele, chronic sx, no red flags on hx)  
- ENT to decide re MRI IAC/brain if indicated  

Impr  
1. Chronic vertigo – likely peripheral (hx vestibular neuritis, positional component, no neuro/auditory red flags on hx)  
2. Hx vestibular neuritis – ?incomplete compensation  
3. Postural hypotension – contributing to “woozy” on standing, needs F2F BP + falls review  
4. Strong pt expectation re ENT + MRI, limited tolerance for stepped care  

Plan  
- Non-urgent ENT (otology/vertigo) referral → regional tertiary centre via HealthLink today, copy to pt (MyHR/email)  
- Note in referral: chronic positional vertigo, hx vestibular neuritis, postural hypotension, no focal neuro on phone, exam limited by telehealth  
- Discussed vestibular physio as 1st line – pt reluctant, will consider “if ENT says so” → defer physio referral for now  
- Prochlorperazine: advised short bursts only (≤2/7 at a time) when really bad, avoid regular use  
- Adv slow position changes, maintain hydration (brief)  
- F2F appt 1–2/52: lying/standing BP, med review (perindopril), falls risk, positional tests if safe  
- Red flags explained: sudden severe vertigo + cannot stand/walk, new wk/numb/facial droop/vision or speech/swallow issues, sudden severe HA, sudden hearing loss → 000/ED  
- Pt: “Fine I’ll go to hospital if it’s that bad but I still want this checked properly”  

F/up: book standard F2F 1–2/52, earlier PRN. Bulk billed today (tele).
