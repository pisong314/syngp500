Thinks maybe diet / “plastic lunch containers” / “hormones” to blame. Time-poor, wants quick plan, “only got 10 mins”.  

Breast lump – L breast “lumpiness” reviewed. No pain now, mild cyc cyclical tenderness only. No nipple d/c, no skin change. Very anxious re ca – “worried I’m going to die and leave the kids in the lurch”.

Ix  
Breast US L: 1.2cm simple cyst @ 2 o’clock, oval, anechoic, thin wall, post enhancement, no solid comps, no abn nodes → BI-RADS 2 benign cyst, no further imaging req.  

PHQ-9 (brief verbal) ~mod range (low mood, anhedonia, sleep, fatigue, conc; no SI).  

A  
1) Mod depressive episode – 1st episode, occupational stressor, fxn preserved but struggling. Low acute suicide risk.  
2) Simple L breast cyst – benign, asymptomatic, contributing to anxiety only.  

P  
Depression  
- Start sertraline 25mg mane 1/52 → if tol ↑ to 50mg mane  
- Couns re SEs (GI, HA, ↑anxiety initially, sexual SE), onset 2–4/52, don’t stop abruptly  
- Brief psycho-ed re stress/sleep; suggested short walks, regular brekkie (pt nods, still looking at watch)  
- Discussed psych options (CBT etc) – pt interested but “can’t do weekly middle-of-the-day stuff”.  
- AHW to look into after-hours/telehealth counselling, will ring pt with options  
- Safety net: if SI / worse mood → ED / Lifeline 13 11 14 / call clinic.  

Breast cyst  
- Reassured – simple benign cyst, no ca features, no extra imaging needed unless change  
- Advised breast awareness – RTC if new lump, skin/nipple change, persistent pain  
- Explained no evidence cyst or “plastic containers” causing depression.  

Prev / f/up  
- Suggested longer gen check (BP, lipids, CST, full breast exam) when can – pt declined today (“have to get back to school”), agrees in principle  
- Review 2–3/52 (late arvo if poss) for mood + sertraline check, consider MHCP / psych ref  
- RTC earlier if mood deteriorates or new breast sx.  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L. Smith – phone check]  
Quick phone call – pt started sertraline this morning, mild nausea only, no SI. Reiterated f/up appt in 2/52, advised can halve dose / take with food if nausea persists. Reviewed and agreed with plan.
