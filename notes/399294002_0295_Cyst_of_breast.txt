Breast cyst  
Noted L breast lump ~6/52 ago self palp  
U/S (tertiary centre) 9mm simple cyst L UOQ anechoic thin wall nil solid components nil abn ax nodes R breast NAD impression simple cyst BI-RADS 2 no further imaging req  
Pt says ache around area on/off esp premenstrual settles with simple analgesia warm packs  
Currently describes pain as “more of a twinge not real bad just scary”  
Nil nipple dc nil skin change nil new lumps nil wt loss nil night sweats nil fevers  

Marked anxiety re malignancy  
Pt “I keep thinking we’re missing something what if it’s actually cancer”  
Reports daily palpation sometimes “feels bigger” then admits varies with cycle and how hard she presses  
Extensive Google use “hours on Google reading stories about cysts turning into cancer”  
Asking repeated times re MRI “are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests maybe an MRI or something stronger”  

Misconceptions addressed  
Pt queried soy milk “maybe from drinking too much soy” and underwire bras “trapping toxins”  
Discussed current evidence nil link between soy intake or underwire bras and breast cysts or breast ca  

Meds / analgesia  
Currently using paracetamol 500–1000mg PRN  occasional ibuprofen 200–400mg PRN dysmenorrhoea

Breast exam not possible via video explained limitation  

Ix reviewed  
Breast U/S 6/52 ago as above simple cyst BI-RADS 2 no sus features no further imaging rec by radiologist  
No prior breast imaging for comparison  

Discussion / differentials  
Extensive discussion held re nature of simple breast cysts including pathophysiology benign course and extremely low risk of malignancy  
Explained simple cyst on U/S by definition fluid filled thin smooth wall posterior acoustic enhancement nil solid component nil internal echoes  
Discussed diff dx for breast lump in this context  
– Simple cyst (most likely given imaging)  
– Fibrocystic change cyclical mastalgia  
– Fibroadenoma less likely given U/S report  
– Malignancy incl cystic carcinoma considered but radiology features not consistent nil red flag sx  
– Mastitis abscess unlikely afebrile nil erythema systemically well  

Explored risks benefits of further imaging vs conservative approach  
– Further imaging eg MRI US rpt or mammo in the setting of BI-RADS 2 simple cyst no FHx may ↑false positives overdiagnosis anxiety unnecessary procedures  
– Current evidence guidelines support conservative management symptom based review  

Pt specifically asked “can a simple cyst turn into cancer later”  
Clarified that simple cysts themselves do NOT transform into ca but important to monitor for new distinct lumps or change in pattern of sx  

Informed consent / shared decision making  
Went through options  
1 Immediate further imaging eg rpt U/S or MRI for reassurance  
2 Conservative Mx with clear safety net face to face breast exam next visit  
3 Referral breast surgeon for specialist opinion  

Explained my recommendation option 2 based on benign U/S BI-RADS 2 nil red flags mild sx only and to avoid harm from over investigation  
Also explained option 1 remains available if new red flag features arise or if significant clinical change  
Pt initially leaning to more tests “I’d rather overcheck than miss something”  
We discussed that tests are not risk free false positives biopsies cost time stress  
After discussion pt agreed to trial conservative approach with strict safety net and plan for in person breast exam with regular GP  
Documented that pt verbalised understanding of rationale for not arranging MRI at this stage  

Analgesia discussion  
Discussed that current pain described as mild intermittent cyclical and well controlled with simple measures  
Risks of codeine combo meds explained incl constipation sedation nausea potential for dependence reduced effectiveness for mild pain  
Informed pt that in context of mild pain and nil recent use repeat script not clinically indicated at present  
Offered optimised simple regimen  
– Paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
– Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food if nil renal/GI issues  
– Warm compresses supportive comfortable bra (non underwire if more comfy)  
Pt accepted plan “I guess I don’t really need the strong stuff right now”  

Health anxiety / support  
Explained concept health anxiety where worry is out of proportion to objective risk and repeated checking Google searching actually ↑anxiety  
Suggested  
– Limit online searching to reputable sites eg Cancer Council Healthdirect and not late at night  
– Self breast exam no more than once per month ideally same point in cycle rather than daily palpation  
Discussed psych input CBT based therapy as evidence based for health anxiety  
Offered MHCP and psych ref  
Pt says “I dont really have time during term” but acknowledged anxiety is “getting a bit much”  
Encouraged to consider booking dedicated mental health appt with usual GP when back home esp if sx persist or interfere with sleep work relationships  
Documented that pt aware of Better Access options  

Other issues  
Pt briefly mentioned feeling generally tired and ?hormone imbalance  
Advised this requires separate longer consult F2F for full hx exam and bloods FBC UEC LFT TFTs iron studies etc  
Pt agreed to book if ongoing  

Assessment  
1 Simple L breast cyst 9mm BI-RADS 2 benign on U/S mild cyclical discomfort nil red flag features  
2 Health anxiety / excessive cancer worry driving repeated presentations Google use reassurance seeking  
3 Analgesia request for codeine based meds not clinically indicated given current mild pain  

Plan  
Breast cyst  
– Reiterated benign nature of simple cysts and that current imaging does not ↑breast ca risk  
– No further imaging indicated now per guidelines unless change in sx or exam findings  
– Arrange in person breast exam with usual GP within next 3–6/12 for baseline and reassurance  
– Pt advised to monitor for new or changing sx  

Analgesia  
– Declined rpt paracetamol–codeine script today documented discussion re risks vs minimal benefit  
– Continue paracetamol 1g up to QID PRN  
– Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food if needed  
– Warm packs supportive bra  

Mental health / health anxiety  
– Education given re health anxiety cycle checking Googling reassurance seeking  
– Suggested practical steps to ↓checking as above  
– Offered MHCP + psych ref pt to consider when back with regular GP  
– If anxiety escalates or starts to impact work/sleep significantly advised to book longer mental health appt  

Safety net / red flags  
Very explicit safety netting discussed at length  
Advised urgent r/v GP or ED if  
– Rapidly enlarging breast lump or swelling esp painful  
– New skin dimpling peau d’orange local erythema warmth  
– New nipple inversion or bloody / serous nipple dc  
– Persistent focal breast pain not clearly cyclical or not settling with simple analgesia  
– Systemic sx fever >38 feeling very unwell rigors or any concern that breast looks infected  
– Any new hard fixed breast lump or axillary lump  

Pt able to repeat back key red flag points in own words “new lump fast change skin pulling nipple changes or really bad pain or fever go straight in”  
Pt states understands that absence of these features currently makes serious pathology less likely  

Follow up  
– F/U with usual GP in 3–6/12 for in person breast exam or earlier if any change as above  
– Separate long appt for fatigue / hormone concerns and MHCP discussion if she wishes  
– Pt advised can rebook telehealth earlier if anxiety worsens or new specific questions re imaging arise  

Written info  
– Recommended pt look at Cancer Council and Healthdirect resources on benign breast conditions and breast cysts  
– Advised to avoid unmoderated forums blogs which were worsening her anxiety  

Pt remained mildly anxious but more settled by end of consult verbalised understanding of plan and agreed to conservative Mx with clear safety net
