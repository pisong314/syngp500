74yo man – review / “bit of a cold and a few other things while I’m here”  

Came mainly re nose: sneezing + blocked nose x ~5–6 days. Says “just won’t stop sneezing, nose all blocked, feel a bit crook but not real bad”. Clear/white runny nose, mild itchy eyes. Scratchy throat at start, now settling. No fever, no rigors, no myalgia, no SOB, no chest pain, no wheeze, no proper cough. Sleep a bit disturbed, propped up on extra pillows (same as usual for HF).  

Thinks “maybe that new air freshener my daughter stuck in the hallway is setting me off”. Also mentions grandkids had “the sniffles” last week. Took saline spray “a couple of times” + one of wife’s old “cold tablets” – unsure what was in it. Advised avoid oral decongestants/pseudoephedrine given HF/PVD.  

While here produced a handwritten list – tried to launch into shoulder pain, mole on back, toenail fungus, sleep, constipation, hearing aid “whistling”, driving medical, elbow pain. Explained time limited today, will need long appt for the rest. Repeated x2, pt still adding “oh, and another thing” but eventually agreed.  

PMHx (relevant):  
- PVD with intermittent claudication L>R ~4 yrs, stable by report (“legs ache if I walk too fast, I just slow down and it settles”). No rest pain, no ulcers.  
- Chronic HF (likely ischaemic, HFrEF). No recent admissions, feels “about the same as usual”.  
- HTN, hyperlipidaemia. ?Old MI ~10 yrs ago, no current angina.  
No known DM, CKD, COPD, stroke.  

Meds:  
Aspirin 100 mg mane, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Perindopril 5 mg mane, Bisoprolol 2.5 mg mane, Furosemide 40 mg mane, Vit D, PRN paracetamol. No regular nasal spray/antihistamine. NKDA.  

O/E 09:20  
Looks well, talking in full sentences, a bit frustrated about not getting through whole list.  
BP 128/72, HR 68 reg, RR 16, SpO₂ 97% RA, afebrile 36.7, BMI ~28.  
ENT: boggy pale-ish turbinates, clear discharge. No sinus tenderness. Mild pharyngeal erythema, no exudate. TMs normal. Mild conjunctival injection only.  
Chest clear, no wheeze/crackles.  
CV: HS dual, no obvious murmur, JVP not up. Mild ankle oedema to mid-shin – pt says “that’s just my normal”.  
Feet warm, pink, reduced DP pulses, PT hard to feel, no ulcers or skin breaks seen.  

Imp:  
1) URTI vs mild allergic rhinitis – day 6, non-toxic, no bacterial red flags. Likely viral with possible irritant/allergic component (air freshener, grandkids).  
2) PVD – stable intermittent claudication, already on aspirin + statin, ex-smoker. High CV risk.  
3) Chronic HF – appears stable, euvolaemic or close, on ACEi, beta blocker, diuretic.  
4) Multiple other non-urgent issues – deferred to long appt.  

Plan:  
- Nasal symptoms:  
  • Continue saline nasal spray bd–qid.  
  • Start fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray: 2 sprays each nostril mane x 7/7 then 1–2 sprays each nostril daily PRN. PBS script.  
  • Cetirizine 10 mg mane PRN if itch/runny nose troublesome (warned may cause mild drowsiness).  
  • Avoid OTC “cold & flu” tabs/decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine) given HF/PVD.  

- PVD / CV risk:  
  • Continue aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, perindopril, bisoprolol.  
  • Briefly reinforced walking to onset of pain then rest/restart; foot checks. No med changes today – discussed that some pts go on low-dose rivaroxaban + aspirin but ↑bleeding; will revisit at proper chronic disease review.  

- HF:  
  • Continue current regimen. No change today. Reminded to watch for sudden wt gain, ↑SOB, swelling – see GP/ED if worse.  

Ix today: none – low suspicion bacterial sinusitis or acute HF/PVD issue and already over time. Plan fasting lipids, U&E/eGFR, HbA1c, FBC at next chronic disease review (last lipids >12 mths ago per pt, no recent bloods in system).  

Admin / follow-up:  
- Asked reception to book long (30 min) appt in 1–2 weeks for: full PVD/HF review, bloods, vaccination check, and to go through his “shopping list” (shoulder, elbow, mole, toenails, sleep, bowels, hearing aid, driving medical).  
- Safety-net: RTc or OOH if fevers, facial/tooth pain, purulent discharge, SOB, chest pain, or if not improving at all by ~10–14 days.  

Bulk billed.  

09:33 – pt again tried to add “just quickly about my shoulder” on way out; re-directed to upcoming long appt.
