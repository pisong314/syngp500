24F – uni student – review rash / “white patches” face  

CC: wants “the strong steroid cream” repeat, “the big tube so I don’t have to keep coming back”  

Hx:  
Known pityriasis alba ~18/12 ago per prev GP  
Worse summer, more obvious when tanned  
No itch, no pain, cosmetic only  
Thinks prev cream “started with B, maybe betamethasone”  
Prev hydrocortisone 1% helped rough/red but “too slow, I want it gone faster”  
No new meds / cosmetics / travel, not preg, non-smoker  

Exam:  
Obs stable (BP 112/70, HR 76, afeb) BMI~22  
Face + upper arms: ill‑defined hypopigmented patches cheeks/temples + extensor upper arms, mild dry + fine scale, no erythema, no vesicles, no excoriations, no complete depigmentation, borders not sharp  
No mucosal / scalp / flexural involvement  
c/w pityriasis alba. No features vitiligo or tinea  

Pt behaviour: quite insistent on stronger steroid, queries why I won’t “just prescribe what I’m asking for”  

A:  
1) Pityriasis alba – mild, non‑inflamed, cosmetic concern  
2) Time-limited consult – other non‑urgent skin concerns deferred (full skin check / derm ref for “laser” to be separate long appt)  

P:  
– Declined mid/high‑potency TCS for face despite pt request → discussed risk skin atrophy, telangiectasia, pigment change esp on face / darker skin  
– Emollient regimen + gentle cleanser advised (QV/Cetaphil etc) – keep it simple  
– Sun protection advised (SPF 30+ daily)  

Meds today:  
– Hydrocortisone 1% oint 15 g PBS  
  Sig: thin layer to rough/slightly pink areas only BD x 5–7/7 then stop. May repeat short courses for flares, max 7/7 at a time, not >2/52 per month on face  

No other med changes  

Pt counselled re benign nature, slow repigmentation (6–12/52), not “bleached by lights/aircon”  
Pt still a bit unhappy re no stronger steroid but agrees trial HC 1% for now, wants review if “not better in a couple of weeks” – advised realistic timeframe longer  

Ix: nil today  

F/U: review 8–10/52 or earlier if rapid spread, new stark white patches, blistering, marked itch, or probs with cream  
Book long appt another day for full skin check / discuss cosmetic options if still bothered  

RTC if worse
