22/11/25 – RACF round – f/up review in room  

CC  
“Sore throat, chest + throat crook again”, URTI sx ~3 days. Staff asked for review.

HPI  
83y F in RACF, known pt, h/o GORD, chronic rhinosinustis, allergic rhinitus. Longstanding poor med complaiance.

3 days URTI:
- main c/o sore throat, worse yest “like razor blades”, a bit better today  
- mild blocked nose + clear runny nose, on/off dry cough, no wheeze  
- no documented fevers; pt “felt a bit hot last night”, no rigors  
- eating/drinking ok but ↓ appetite. No diffculty w liquids, no drooling  
- denies SOB, CP, abdo pain, D+V  

Thinks aircon “blowing on my neck” caused it. Also blames “those reflux tablets” and has been skipping them: “I ran out… didn’t bother saying anything”. Staff confirm multiple PPI refusals over last mth.

Baseline chronic rhinosinusitis/allergic rhinitis – daily congestion, forgets steroid spray “half the time”. No new facial pain, no purulent d/c.

GORD – was well controlled on PPI, now more night throat clearing + some retrosternal discomfort on some nights, not acute today.

Examination (focused)  
Gen: Thin elderly, mildly unwell but comfy, talking full sentances.  
Obs: T 37.4, HR 82 reg, BP 138/74, RR 16, SpO₂ 97% RA.  
Throat: erythematous pharynx/soft palate, no tonsillar exudate, small tonsils, uvula midline, no drooling, no trismus.  
Neck: small tender ant cerv nodes, mobile, no swellling.  
Chest: clear, good AE, no wheeze/crackles.  
Abdo: soft, NT.

Impression  
1. Acute pharyngitis / URTI – likely viral (cough, rhinorhoea, low/no fever, no exudate, not high‑risk ARF). No signs deep neck infection/airway compromise.  
2. Chronic rhinosinusitis + allergic rhinitus – suboptimally controlled, contributing to ongoing throat irritation/postnasal drip.  
3. GORD – poorly controlled due to non‑adherance; may add to chronic throat sx.  
4. Ongoing med refusals / ?mild cognative issues – needs simple plan + RACF support.

Plan  
URTI / throat  
- No abx – discussed viral picture with pt.  
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN pain/fever (max 4g/day) – already charted; RN to offer more regularly next 1–2 days if throat pain limiting intake.  
- Saline gargles + warm fluids, soft diet as tolerated.  
- Lozenges PRN if RN happy with swallowing.

Red flags – RN to call GP/ambulance if: fever ≥38 persisting, worse throat pain, can’t swallow / refusing fluids, drooling, muffled voice, neck swelling, stridor, SOB, or genrally much more crook.

Ix  
- Nil today – no throat swab/bloods as mild, stable.  
- If not improving or worse >5–7 days, consider throat swab + FBE/CRP (QML/SNP as per facility).

Rhinosinusitis / allergic rhinitus  
- Re‑explained need for regular steroid spray to reduce congestion + throat irritation. Pt: “I forget the nose stuff all the time” but agrees if staff bring with morning meds.  
- RN: please prompt daily mometasone nasal spray as charted for at least 4/52, document refusals.  
- Saline nasal spray PRN if available.

GORD  
- Continue esomeprazole 20mg mane with breakfast. RN to supervise, record any refusals.  
- Briefly explained reflux can make throat “feel funny”; pt says “If it helps the throat, I’ll try”. Will need more detailed GORD review later (diet, nocturnal sx, bone risk) – book longer appt 2–4/52.

Adherance / cognition  
- Asked RN to keep closer note of refused meds (PPI + nasal spray esp) and gently reinforce why they’re needed when offering.  
- Plan longer review with daughter/EPOA present for adherence strategies + possible cog screen.

Follow‑up  
- Review on next routine RACF round ~1 week – check throat, obs, oral intake.  
- Earlier review if any deterioration as above.

[Added 16:30 by Dr L. Chan – phoned RN]  
RN reports pt ate lunch well, took paracetamol and PPI this morn, declined nasal spray “too much fuss” – refusal noted. No fever, obs stable. Plan unchanged, re‑address nasal spray at next visit.
