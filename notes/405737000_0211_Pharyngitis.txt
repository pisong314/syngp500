PMHx: “recurrent tonsillitis” childhood only. Otherwise NIL sig recorded.  
Meds: intermittent OTC paracetamol only. Unsure any reg meds.  
NKDA known

Exam (TelH only): talking full sentences, no audible resp distress, voice clear, no obvious hoarseness/stridor by phone. Able to maintain PO intake. No obs available. Denies feeling very unwell.

Impression:  
1) Unilat sore throat – likely acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis, prob viral ± mild strep. Low ARF risk (Anglo-Aus metro, no RF hx, no overcrowding). No red flags by hx for PTA/deep neck space infxn/airway compromise. Duration borderline but systemic sx mild + cough → viral more likely. Poor historian → dx uncertainty.  
2) Hx recurrent tonsillitis (childhood) – not at ENT criteria currently.

Plan:  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (max 4 g/24h) – advised check strength / follow pack  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg PO 8-hourly PRN with food (max 1.2 g/24h) if no asthma/renal/GI issues (denies)  
– Non-Rx: warm fluids, honey, rest, avoid voice strain/smoking. Can use OTC anaesthetic lozenges/sprays.  
– Abx: not indicated today – likely viral, low ARF risk, mild-mod sx, TelH only. Discussed limited benefit. Will consider throat swab + targeted abx (e.g. phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg QID 10/7) if F2F review and strep suspected/confirmed.  
– Ix: none today. F2F review + consider throat swab if not improving 48–72 hrs, persisting fever >3–5 d, or any concern.  
– Safety net: ED/000 if ↑unilat pain + can’t swallow saliva, drooling, trismus, muffled voice, stridor/noisy breathing, SOB, sig neck swelling/torticollis, high fevers/rigors/confusion, or can’t maintain fluids (↓urine, dizziness, lethargy). RTC earlier if worse / no improvement.  
– Work: med cert x2 days provided. Advised off work if febrile/unwell; if future confirmed strep + abx → 24 hrs abx before RTW.  
– F/up: F2F in 2–3 d if not improving, sooner if deteriorates. If recurrent documented sore throats (≥7/yr or ≥5/yr x2 yrs or ≥3/yr x3 yrs) → consider ENT.

Pt wants “general health check” next time – advised separate long appt when well.
