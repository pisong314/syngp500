32F Aboriginal, known HIV. Hosp worker. F/up HIV + cough  

HPC  
10/7 hx URTI → sore throat, rhinorrhoea, low-grade temp, dry cough  
Now URTI sx mostly settled, cough persists  
Mainly dry, occasional small clear sputum, worse at night + talking/laughing at work  
No SOB (can still do stairs at work), no pleuritic CP, no haemoptysis, no night sweats, no wt loss  
No GI sx, no neuro sx  
Max temp home 37.8  
Contacts w “flu” at work + housemate  
No recent OS/remote travel, no known TB contacts  
Pt: “worried it’s something like PCP not just a virus” + queries bleach at work “irritating my airways”  
Asked re “guidelines and low threshold for CXR in people with HIV and a new cough”  

PMHx  
HIV dx ~5y. On Biktarvy 1/d, excellent adherence  
Last ID review ~3/12 ago → VL undetectable, CD4 ~420 (pt “just over 400”)  
No prior OIs, not on TMP-SMX proph  
Hx PID/recurrent BV – asymptomatic now  
No asthma/COPD/DM/CKD/heart dz  

Meds  
Biktarvy mane  
PRN paracetamol  
Condoms for contraception  
NKDA  

Exam  
Looks well, speaking full sentences, NAD  
Obs: T 37.4 HR 86 BP 112/70 RR 16 SpO2 99% RA  
Chest clear, no wheeze/crackles, good AE, no dullness  
ENT mild postnasal drip, OP mild erythema, no exudate  
CVS dual, no oedema  
Abdo soft NT  
No rash  

Impression  
1) Persistent cough ~10d in well-controlled HIV → c/w post-viral / post-infectious cough. Low suspicion PNA/PCP/TB given short duration, normal sats, normal chest exam, CD4 >400 but will err on cautious side (pt concerned)  
2) HIV stable on ART, f/up ID as planned  
3) Hx PID/BV – nil current issues, defer  

Plan  
– CXR PA/lat today (QXR) given HIV + new cough + pt anxiety re PCP/TB  
– No resp viral PCR (onset >1 wk, unlikely to change Mx)  
– Symptomatic only:  
   • Honey/simple linctus PRN  
   • Saline nasal spray/steam for postnasal drip  
   • Paracetamol 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/d)  
   • Avoid bleach fumes at work if poss, mask if needed  
– Briefly discussed typical PCP picture (progressive exertional SOB, dry cough, fever, hypoxia) – current hx not typical but low threshold for Ix. Pt: “that matches what I read in the BHIVA guidance”  
– HIV: continue Biktarvy, no change. Has ID clinic review ~3/12 – bring CXR report. Routine HIV bloods to be done via ID (avoid duplication)  
– Vaccinations: ?pneumococcal – to check records next visit, may need update  

Safety net  
RTC/ED if SOB esp on exertion, high fevers/rigors, haemoptysis, pleuritic CP, or systemic decline (↑fatigue, night sweats, wt loss)  

F/up  
Review 1/52 (telehealth OK if stable) to check CXR + sx  
Earlier if deteriorates  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – ignore, old recall left in system, will update at next visit
