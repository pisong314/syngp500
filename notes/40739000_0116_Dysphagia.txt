74F, reg pt.  

Reason for visit:  
F/up – swallowing issues. “Food not going down properly, feels like it sticks halfway.”

HPC:  
~6–8 wks hx dysphagia, mainly solids (meat, bread). “Feels like it stops about here” (mid sternum). Happening most days now. Solids >> liquids. Needs to sip water to get it down, occas has to stop and wait. No complete blockage so far. No coughing/choking, no food “going down the wrong way”. No odynophagia.  

Occasional retrosternal “heartburn” a few times/week, worse after big tea at night, partly relieved by Quick‑Eze OTC. No prev dx GORD, no known oesophgeal issues.  

No wt loss – “if anything I should lose a bit”. Appetite OK but avoiding steak, eating slower. No fevers, no melaena/haematemesis, bowels normal.  

Pt wondering “maybe too much tea and not enough water” and also new bakery bread “seems heavier”. Discussed more likley oesophgeal cause, needs workup, she agrees – “No point mucking around, just get it checked.”  

Meds (from phone list, unchanged):  
- Perindopril 5mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 20mg nocte  
- Metformin XR 500mg mane  
- Aspirin 100mg mane  

NKDA.  
Lives with husband, independant, drives.  

Examination (focused):  
Well appeaing, talking in full sentances. Vitals stable (BP 132/74, HR 76, afebrile, Sats 98% RA).  
Oropharnyx clear, no thrush, no lesions. Neck – no LN, no goitre. Chest clear, HS dual, abdo soft NT, no masses. No obvious neuro defecits. No signs malnutriton or dehydration.  

Impression:  
1) Oesophgeal dysphagia, solids > liquids, progressive ~2/12 in 74F – red flag, needs urgent structural assesment. DDx: malignancy, peptic stricture, Schatzki ring, EoE, motility d/o (achalasia etc). Currently no wt loss or aspirtation features.  
2) Probable underlyng GORD contributing.  

Plan:  
- URGENT gastro referal (Cat 1) for OGD + biopsies (incl EoE, Barrett’s if seen). Letter done – onset, solids>liquids, no wt loss, started PPI.  
- Bloods today: FBC, U&E, LFTs, iron studies, B12, folate, CRP. (HbA1c etc to do at chronic dz reveiw – no time today).  
- Start esomeprazole 20mg mane, 30 mins before breakfast, continue till specialist review. PBS script given.  
- Adv to stick to softer foods for now, chew well, small mouthfulls, sip water.  
- Safety net: ED/000 if food completely stuck (can’t swallow saliva), severe chest pain, haematemesis, SOB. RTC earlier if new cough with eating, fever, wt loss.  

Chronic dz:  
Pt mentioned “my sugars have been a bit high again” and needs usual scripts. Explained need to focus on new dysphagia today, will book long appt in 2–3 wks for diabetes/CV reveiw + fasting bloods. Pt happy.  

Follow up:  
Review 2–3 wks (or sooner if OGD done) to check symptoms, bloods, confirm gastro appt.  

Billing:  
Standard consult, bulk billed today.
