CC:  
Tired with eating / swallowing issues  

HPI:  
42 yr old Anglo-Aussie male, mod intelletual disabilty, comes with support worker.  
Pt says he is "just a bit more tired with meals, nothing really" and "don't wanna be a bother".  
Support worker worried re swallow + weight over last few mnths.

3–4 mths hx meals taking "ages", feels "worn out" by end of meal.  
Food "sometimes a bit slow going down", occas "catches" mid–chest esp meat, dry bread. Needs to sip water with solids. Avoids harder foods at work – "easier if I just have something soft".  

Intermitent cough with drinks, mainly thin fluids, ~2–3x/wk. No full obstruction, no Heimlick. Support worker has seen him "go quiet, look uncomfy and rub his chest" when eating. No odynophagia. Mild heartburn 1–2x/wk after big dinners, uses OTC antacids "once in a while".  

Noted more tired in arvos, worse after meals. Still working usual hrs but "slows down a bit" after lunch.  
Unintentional wt loss – records show ~88kg 10 mths ago, 82.1kg today (~6kg down). Pt says clothes "a bit baggier".  

No known stroke, neuromusc dz. No hx oesoph surg / head & neck surg. Non smoker, no ETOH. NDIS participant – support worker.  

Meds:  
- Paracetamol 500mg 1–2 tabs PRN headache (about weekly)  
- OTC antacid chewables PRN  
No known drug allergies.

Exam (focused):  
Obs: BP 124/76, HR 84 reg, RR 14, SpO2 98% RA, afebrile.  
Gen: NAD, able to talk full sentences, voice normal. Looks a bit slimmer vs old notes.  
Wt 82.1kg, Ht 176cm (BMI 26.5).  
Chest: clear, no added sounds.  
Abdo: soft, NT.  
Neuro brief: CN grossly intact, no dysarthria.  
Quick swallow in rooms – small sip water, single swallow, slight throat clear, no cough, no wet voice.

Impression:  
1) Dysphagia with meal–related fatigue, ?mixed oropharangeal/oesophgeal in 42yo male w intelletual disabilty.  
   – Red flags: wt loss, food "sticking" mid chest, coughing with thin fluids. No complete obstruction/haematemesis. Need prompt w/up, risk of aspiration.  
   – DDx: oesoph motility d/o (achalasia, ineffective peristalsis), stricture, GORD–related, eosinophilc oesophagitis, vs oropharangeal dysphagia.  
2) Mild unintentional wt loss (~6kg/10 mths) in context of above.  
3) Intellectual disability – impacts hx + ability to follow complex swallow strategies, needs clear written plan for carers.

Ix ordered (S&N path today):  
- FBC  
- UEC, CMP  
- LFT  
- Iron studies  
- B12, folate  
- CRP  

No CXR today – chest clear, no acute resp sx. Will order if any recurrent chest infx / concern aspiration.

Plan:  
- Start PPI trial for reflux sx while awaiting scopes:  
  • Esomeprazole 20mg mane, 30 mins before breakfast x 4 wks (PBS).  
- Avoid NSAIDs. Continue paracetamol PRN only.  

Referrals:  
- Speech pathology (priority) – swallow assesment, ?VFSS, recs on safe textures, pacing, positioning. Ask for written dysphagia plan for group home + workplace.  
- Gastroenterology (non-urgent but soon, aim 4–6 wks) – for upper GI endoscopy +/- barium swallow/manometry to rule out structural / malignant / EoE / motility cause.  

Safety / advice (brief):  
Explained in simple terms risk of food "going down the wrong way".  
Interim: small mouthfuls, eat slowly, plenty of sips water, avoid very dry/tough foods for now. Sit upright for meals.  
Advised pt + support worker: ED if food stuck and not clearing, severe chest pain, trouble breathing, or fever + cough / SOB after meals. Pt says "I've put up with worse" but agreed to "do what you reckon so I don't choke".  

Follow up:  
- Review 2–3 wks: check bloods, response to PPI, confirm speech path + gastro appts, re-weigh, reassess swallow / any chest sx.  
- Longer appt later for gen health screen (lipids, diabetes, vax, MH) – deferred today due to time.

Billing:  
Standard consult (item 23), bulk billed.
