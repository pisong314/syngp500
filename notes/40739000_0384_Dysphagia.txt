Here with support worker Jenny (disability enterprise).  

Reason: wants “my COVID and flu needles, I think I’m due again”. Also quick check re swallowing.

HPI / bits of background (mixed in):  
32 y/o woman, CP + developmental disability, long‑standing dysphagia/aspiration risk, GORD on PPI. In wheelchair, lives in supported accommodation (NDIS, staff manage meds/meals). Poor historian, relies on staff.

Vaccines:  
- Unsure what she’s had, thinks “the one in the arm last year… or was it the year before?”  
- Checked EMR/AIR:  
  - COVID: Pfizer x3, last 18/08/23  
  - Flu: last 04/04/24  
- No previous reactions recorded, she recalls only “sore arm”.  
- No current fever/acute illness per pt + Jenny.

Dysphagia today:  
- Known oropharyngeal dysphagia, speech path review 2023 – minced & moist + mildly thick fluids, upright 90°, slow, supervised.  
- Today says “sometimes the food feels a bit stuck here” (points mid sternum). Timing vague (“maybe last week… maybe when we had pizza at work ages ago”).  
- Jenny: occasional coughing with thin fluids, esp when distracted. No choking needing first aid, no recent ABx, no known recent chest infections.  
- No SOB, chest pain, wheeze today.  
- Group home weights reportedly stable (no numbers with them). She says eats “okay except when it’s really chewy meat”.  
- She thinks maybe due to lying down on couch after dinner, and “juice at work is too cold”.  

PMHx (relevant only):  
- Cerebral palsy, ambulant with assistance but uses wheelchair here.  
- Developmental/intellectual disability.  
- Chronic dysphagia with aspiration risk.  
- GORD – on esomeprazole 20 mg mane.  
- No known drug allergies.

Meds (as far as we know – to be confirmed):  
- Esomeprazole 20 mg mane.  
- Baclofen 10 mg bd.  
- PRN paracetamol.  
- Thickening agent for fluids (variable adherence – Jenny unsure).  
- OCP stopped 2024.  
Pt cannot name meds/doses.

Exam – brief:  
Gen: Slim, alert, pleasant, chatty but vague. No resp distress.  
Obs: BP 112/68, HR 82, RR 16, SpO₂ 98% RA, T 36.7.  
Chest: Clear, good AE, no added sounds. No cough during consult.  
CVS: HS dual, no obvious murmur.  
Oropharynx: mild drooling, no thrush/lesions seen.  
Neuro/MSK: baseline CP with spasticity, posture slumped in chair, needs prompts to sit upright.  
Weight not done today (wheelchair, treatment room busy). Last 54 kg @ 160 cm ~6/12 ago (BMI ~21).

Assessment (rough):  
1) Vaccination – due for 2025 flu, eligible for further COVID booster (chronic neuro disability). No contraindications today.  
2) Chronic dysphagia in CP/dev disability – ongoing aspiration risk; symptoms broadly similar, ?occasional oesophageal component (“stuck” mid‑sternum). No current evidence of pneumonia or major weight loss but monitoring patchy.  
3) GORD – likely contributing to discomfort, appears mostly controlled on PPI but history unreliable.

Plan:  
Vaccines:  
- Gave today:  
  - Influenza vaccine 2025 season IM L deltoid  
  - COVID‑19 monovalent XBB.1.5 booster IM R deltoid (ATAGI – disability, chronic neuro).  
- Observed 15 mins, no immediate reaction.  
- Entered in AIR.  
- Very brief post‑vax advice to pt + Jenny re sore arm, fever, when to seek urgent care (breathing issues, chest pain, anaphylaxis etc).

Dysphagia / aspiration:  
- Re‑emphasised existing speech path plan: minced & moist, mildly thickened fluids, upright during and ≥30 mins after meals, small mouthfuls, slow, supervised.  
- Advised avoid thin/unthickened fluids unless cleared by speech path – Jenny to pass on to house.  
- Referral: repeat speech pathology review (NDIS if possible) – reassess swallow, consider videofluoro, confirm IDDSI level and strategies.  
- Asked staff to bring recent weight chart next visit; watch for ↑ coughing with meals, choking, recurrent chest infections, fevers, weight loss, ↓ intake.  
- If new resp sx or weight loss → consider CXR + bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, iron, B12, folate, albumin).

GORD / meds:  
- Continue esomeprazole 20 mg mane for now.  
- Asked Jenny to get full current med list from group home/pharmacy for next review – need med reconciliation, check for any sedatives/anticholinergics or difficult‑to‑swallow tablets.  
- She briefly mentioned “tummy hurts a bit at night” – likely GORD, but no time today for full work‑up; will review if persists.

Carer input:  
- Jenny confirms no recent hospital/ED visits (last known ED 2022 for gastro in EMR).  
- She will update house manager and mealtime care plan with today’s advice and referrals.

Follow‑up:  
- Review with GP in ~3/12 or earlier if choking, recurrent cough, fever, chest infection, or noticeable weight change/reduced intake.  
- Book longer appt once speech path report + full med list available – consider case conference with group home if ongoing issues.

Checked AIR again – COVID and flu both correctly uploaded, no duplicate entries. No further action today.
