POC  
RBG 9.8 mmol/L (~2h post lunch)  
COVID RAT -ve  

Impression  
1) Acute cough – likely viral URTI / viral bronchitis. No red flags, chest clear, obs normal, RAT -ve, low susp COVID/flu.  
2) Hypothyroidism in DS + T1DM – on thyroxine 100 mcg mane, adherence “most days”. Needs TFT review.  
3) T1DM – established, appears reasonably controlled today, limited info. No DKA features.  

Plan  
1) Cough / URTI  
- No abx  
- Symptomatic Rx: paracetamol PRN, fluids, simple cough mix if needed  
- Cert for work x2/7  
- Safety net: ED/urgent review if ↑SOB, CP, haemoptysis, fevers ≥38° >48h, can’t keep fluids down, confusion. RTC if cough >3–4/52 or worse in 5–7/7  

2) Hypothyroidism  
- Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg mane (empty stomach, before brekkie – advised SW)  
- Path forms given (am fasting if poss):  
  • TFTs (TSH, FT4)  
  • FBC, U&E, LFTs  
  • Lipids, HbA1c  
- Review 2–3/52 with results, consider dose adjust (aim TSH low‑normal)  
- Consider endo review at f/u if abn or control poor  

3) T1DM  
- No insulin changes today (info incomplete, short consult)  
- Adv SW: continue usual insulin, ↑BGL checks while unwell (pre‑meals + HS). Maintain fluids. Urgent care if BGL >15 with ketones, vomiting, abdo pain.  
- HbA1c ordered with above  
- Ask to bring updated diabetes plan, insulin chart, specialist letters next visit – book std/long appt for chronic dz review  

4) F/U / admin  
- SW to book review 2–3/52  
- Bring med admin record + vax/immunisation record / check My Health Record next time (flu/COVID status unclear)  

Pt + SW indicated understanding; note pt recall limited → rely on staff documentation.
