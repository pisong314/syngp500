42M review post GBS  

HPC  
Recent GBS dx – hosp 4/52 ago post “tummy bug” w bloody diarrhoea → rapidly progressive distal weakness + paraesthesia feet→hands over ~5/7  
Had IVIg x5/7 in hosp, no ICU, no PEX. Discharged ~10/7 ago w outpt physio  

Today: still “pins/needles + numb patches” feet to mid‑calf, fingertips both hands. “Walking on thick socks”. No burning/shooting pain. Mild dull ache calves PM ~3/10  
Legs feel a bit weak, stairs harder but still managing. Walks ~200–300m then rest. No falls. Fine motor slightly clumsy but still working tools if needed  
No SOB, no orthopnoea, no nocturnal resp sx. No facial weakness, swallow fine  
Occasional light‑headed on standing quickly, no syncope, no bowel/bladder sx  

Pt with long “shopping list” of extras – shoulder pain on ladder, skin tag, vasectomy query, heartburn, “cholesterol + full blood check”, knee clicking etc. Time limited → deferred, asked to book long appt. Mildly frustrated, keeps going back to list  

Meds: nil regular. No analgesia  
Allergies: NKDA  

OE (focused)  
Gen: alert, ambulant, moves cautiously but indep  
BP 122/78 sitting → 110/72 standing (asx). HR 86 reg, RR 14, SpO₂ 99% RA, afeb  
Neuro: CN grossly intact  
Power UL 5/5  
LL ~4+/5 hip/knee/ankle bilat, mild fatigue on repeated heel raises  
Reflexes: UL ↓ (1+), knees 0–1+, ankles absent. Plantars flexor  
Sensation ↓ LT + vibration feet to just above ankles, mild glove ↓ LT to PIP joints. Gait slightly wide‑based, slow but steady, tandem mildly unsteady  
No obvious wasting  

Ix  
Recent extensive w/up in hosp – CSF ↑protein, NCS = demyelinating polyneuropathy per discharge summary  
No new tests today – will do FBE, UEC, LFT, lipids, fasting BSL next long appt per pt request (QML/S&N)  

A  
1) GBS – early recovery phase s/p IVIg 4/52  
   Residual distal sensory sx + mild LL weakness only. Overall improving vs discharge. No red flag neuro/resp today. Mild orthostatic drop only  
2) Mild neuropathic/sensory sx – not currently painful → no meds yet  
3) Multiple non‑urgent issues (MSK, skin tag, vasectomy, heartburn, screening bloods) – not addressed due time  

P  
– Reassured likely post‑infectious monophasic course, recovery over months, residual sx common  
– Safety net: ED/000 if ↑weakness (stairs/chair, grip), spreading numbness, new facial weakness, swallow/speech change, SOB, can’t count to 20 in one breath, chest tight, new bladder/bowel issues  
– Continue outpt physio, pacing, avoid over‑fatigue  
– No ladder work / heights / heavy lifting until cleared by neuro/physio → med cert 2/52 off electrician duties given (safety)  
– No neuropathic agents for now – consider gabapentin/pregabalin/SNRI if burning/shooting pain develops  
– Advise slow position changes, keep hydrated. Encourage gentle mobilisation, ankle pumps, avoid prolonged immobility  
– Vaccines: no recent vax pre‑onset. Advised routine vax generally ok but defer non‑urgent until neuro review, will confirm with neuro  
– Neuro outpt f/up in ~2/52 – will send brief update letter via HealthLink  

– Asked pt to book long (30 min) review in 1–2/52 with me to go through “list” + do baseline bloods (FBE, UEC, LFT, lipids, fasting glucose)  

RTC earlier if any deterioration as above  

[No prior HbA1c/lipids trend available – first screening planned next visit]  

09:23 note finished – running late for next pt
