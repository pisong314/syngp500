Assessment  
1 JIA polyarticular longstanding currently clinically quiescent/mild AM stiffness only on MTX 15mg weekly celecoxib PRN  
   – No features MAS or systemic flare afebrile nil organomegaly nil cytopenia sx  
   – Needs ongoing dz + MTX monitoring as per rheum/ACR style guidance  

2 Fatigue subacute mild–mod in young woman w chronic inflammatory dz known ACD poor sleep hygiene low activity high health anx  
   – No B sx nil focal red flags nil cardioresp sx exam reassuring  
   – DDx includes ACD vs iron deficiency vs B12/folate deficiency vs thyroid dysfn vs vit D deficiency vs mood/anx contribution  
   – Malignancy felt low likelihood currently but will exclude common reversible causes as per RACGP fatigue guidance  

3 Anaemia of chronic disease prev dx status currently unknown  
   – Menstrual hx not suggestive heavy loss nil overt GIT/GU bleed  
   – Need FBC iron studies etc to confirm pattern ACD vs IDA vs mixed  

4 Psoriasis mild limited plaques managed only w OTCs  
   – No clinical psoriatic arthritis currently nil dactylitis nil nail pitting  
   – Scope for stepped topical therapy if symptomatic flare  

5 Short stature / growth retardation established static adult height no active issue today  

6 Health anxiety high health-related internet use driving repeated requests for investigations  
   – Likely contributing to fatigue and functional impact  
   – Would benefit from structured GP continuity psychoeducation CBT-based approach possible MHCP as per anxiety mgmt guidelines  

7 JIA-related eye risk  
   – Currently asymptomatic but last slit lamp ~2yrs ago  
   – Needs periodic ophthal review as per JIA uveitis screening recommendations  

Plan  
Time limited today focused on fatigue/anaemia workup MTX safety reassurance more detailed MH and lifestyle to be done in longer appt  

# Investigations today  
– FBC  
– Iron studies ferritin iron transferrin saturation  
– B12 folate  
– ESR CRP  
– U&E LFTs  
– TFTs TSH free T4  
– Vit D  
These also serve as MTX monitoring (FBC LFT Cr)  
Explained why non specific “cancer markers” not recommended in primary care low yield may cause harm via false + pt initially disappointed but accepted after explanation  

?Coeliac serology to be added later if IDA or unexplained pattern  

# JIA / MTX  
– Continue MTX 15mg weekly + folic acid 5mg weekly unchanged today  
– Reinforced key safety points avoid pregnancy on MTX limit alcohol seek r/v for fevers sore throat mouth ulcers SOB easy bruising  
– Discussed need for ongoing rheum follow up cost barrier noted  
   → Plan public hospital rheum OPD referral once baseline bloods back and summary prepared pt keen as “cant afford private all the time”  

# Fatigue / ACD  
– Await above bloods to clarify anaemia type exclude thyroid B12 folate vit D deficiency etc  
– Brief advice re sleep hygiene regular bedtime ↓screen time avoid energy drinks esp pm  
– Explained likely multifactorial fatigue chronic inflammatory state ± mild anaemia ↓fitness poor sleep health anx rather than occult malignancy  
– Safety net see below  

# Psoriasis  
– Mild currently continue OTC coal tar/salicylic + emollients  
– If worsening or more extensive will consider topical corticosteroid/vit D analogue PBS options and possible derm ref  

# Eye health  
– Recommended r/v with optometrist/ophthalmologist for slit lamp uveitis screen given JIA hx despite nil sx  
– Will likely organise ophthal ref when doing rheum ref so can bundle admin for pt
