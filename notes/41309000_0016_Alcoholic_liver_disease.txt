Ix – today  
Baseline / staging and screening  
• LFTs AST ALT ALP GGT bili albumin  
• FBC U&E CMP incl Ca Mg PO4  
• INR  
• Fasting lipids  
• Fasting BSL HbA1c  
• Iron studies incl ferritin transferrin sat (?HH vs alcohol related hyperferritinaemia)  
• B12 folate Vit D  
• Hep B serology HBsAg anti HBs anti HBc  
• Hep C Ab  

Imaging  
• Liver US + elastography requested FibroScan if available via local radiology to assess fibrosis / ?cirrhosis / portal HTN  

Assessment  
1 Alcoholic liver disease  
Clinically compensated today nil features decompensation (nil jaundice ascites encephalopathy GI bleed) ongoing ETOH 3–8 beers most days despite dx  
Discussed that "cutting back" not enough for alcoholic liver disease best outcome with complete abstinence potential for some recovery if no advanced cirrhosis and stops now  

2 Mild fatigue ?slight wt loss over 6–12/12  
Likely multifactorial work load diet ETOH liver disease  
Need to excl progression liver disease nutritional deficiency metabolic issues with bloods above  

3 Preventive health middle aged male high ETOH risk  
Opportunistic CV/metabolic screen and vax but time limited today will stagger over next few visits  

Plan  
Alcohol use / liver  
– Strongly advised complete abstinence from alcohol explained rationale  
– Agreed trial 0 ETOH for at least 4/52 then r/v  
– Ok to use zero alcohol beer non sugary drinks clarified that true zero alc fine but any % alcohol not ok for liver  
– Energy drinks advised limit to 1–2/wk main concern CV sleep not liver @ this level  
– Assessed withdrawal risk pattern suggests mod dependence risk but nil morning drinking nil shakes nil blackouts has had short abstinent periods without signif withdrawal prev  
– Educated re possible withdrawal sx tremor sweats agitation halucinations etc ED if severe  
– Offered AOD support pt prefers phone/online → referral sent to local community AOD counselling service  
– Continue thiamine 100mg PO daily and multivit  

Lifestyle / nutrition  
Brief advice re regular meals dont skip breakfast ↑protein each meal ↑fruit veg ↓takeaway  
Dietitian ref discussed pt wants to see bloods first will revisit next appt  

Preventive  
– CV/metabolic screen via fasting lipids BSL HbA1c as ordered  
– Encouraged ↑PA aim ~150min/wk eg brisk walks after work a few days/wk  
– Vax check deferred pt unsure last tetanus hep B status will check records next visit consider hep A/B influenza COVID as indicated  
– Bowel cancer screening to discuss at later r/v  

Safety net  
Advised urgent review / ED if develops  
• jaundice  
• ↑abdo swelling or pain esp RUQ  
• vomiting blood or black stools  
• confusion marked drowsiness  
• fever feeling very crook  
• concerning ETOH withdrawal sx eg severe tremor agitation halucinations seizures  
Standard advice also to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain or confusion  

Follow up  
Booked f/u 2/52  
– review bloods and liver US  
– check progress with abstinence / any withdrawal  
– discuss dietitian ref immunisations broader preventive health incl bowel Ca screen sleep ?OSA mental health screen etc  

Pt engagement  
Pt cooperative engaged asking re chance of liver "recovering" if stops now appears motivated to "do the right thing" esp if tests show progression agrees to f/u
