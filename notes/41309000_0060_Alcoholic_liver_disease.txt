A:  
1) Alcoholic liver dz / probable early cirrhosis  
   - AST>ALT, ↑GGT, low Alb, ↑INR, mild ↑bili, thrombocytopenia → chronic EtOH liver injury  
   - Clinically stable, no red flags for acute decomp / severe alcoholic hepatitis tonight  
   - Not appropriate for prednisolone in AH GP: no objective severe disease, needs hepatology input if ever considered  

2) Ongoing harmful EtOH use / dependence  
   - Still ~½ bottle spirits/day. Pre‑contemplative/early contemplative. Hx mild withdrawal sx only  

3) Malnutrition + likely ongoing micronutrient deficiency

P:  

Liver / LFTs:  
- Explained AST:ALT pattern typical EtOH, not alone indication for “strong meds”  
- Documented: pt requested steroids; advised not clinically indicated/safe in current setting; steroids usually for severe alcoholic hepatitis under specialist / often inpatient  
- No acute admit tonight – stable obs, no encephalopathy, no GI bleed, no tense ascites, no severe pain  

EtOH:  
- Brief counselling: direct link drinking → progression to cirrhosis/decomp  
- Advised avoid abrupt cessation alone due withdrawal risk; consider supervised detox via hosp/GP if decides to stop  
- Given local AOD service details on printout – pt “will think about it”  

Nutrition / vitamins:  
- Start thiamine 100 mg PO TDS x 3–5/7 then 100 mg mane ongoing (PBS script)  
- Advise daily multivitamin w minerals (OTC, cheap brand ok)

  - Repeat LFT, FBC, U&E, INR in 1–2/52  
  - Hep B/C serology if not done  
  - Full nutritional panel (vit A,D,E, B12, folate, Zn, selenium, iron studies/ferritin, Ca, Vit D, bone health later e.g. DEXA)  
  - Liver U/S + Doppler 1st line (architecture, portal HTN, ascites, lesions)  
  - Hepatology / gastro clinic referral (regional centre) for staging + mgmt plan  
- Pt demanded CT/MRI “this week”. Explained U/S 1st line in our setting; CT/MRI if indicated by findings/specialist. Pt unhappy but accepted U/S plan “for now”  

Safety net (brief):  
- To ED urgently if: ↑ jaundice, confusion/drowsy/behaviour change, haematemesis/melaena, severe abdo pain or big swell, fever/very unwell, persistent V or severe withdrawal sx if cutting down  
- Pt verbalised understanding though minimises risk
