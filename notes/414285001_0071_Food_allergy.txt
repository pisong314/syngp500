1 Dysphagia chest discomfort  
?Eosinophilic oesophagitis vs GORD vs motility / structural lesion  
Young atopic pt food allergy hx intermittent solid food dysphagia food sticking chest tightness + reflux sx reassuringly nil wt loss bleed persistent vomit but dysphagia needs scope  

2 Food allergy 2° egg tree nuts SNOMED 414285001  
Hx c/w IgE mediated egg nut allergy lip swelling + generalised urticaria in past no frank anaphylaxis but at risk → should have adrenaline autoinjector spec r/v  
Need to avoid over restriction currently just avoiding egg all nuts  

3 Anxiety re choking / allergy

Other problems (not addressed)  
L shoulder pain ?overuse / rot cuff  
Onychomycosis R hallux  
Contraception review  
Intermittent postural dizziness  

Plan  
1 Dysphagia / ?EoE / GORD  
- Urgent non admitted gastro ref for OGD + oesophageal biopsies to assess for EoE vs reflux oesophagitis vs structural lesion  
  HealthLink ref sent copy to public clinic wait time discussed  
- Empirical PPI  
  Esomeprazole 20mg mane 30min pre breakfast trial 4–8/52 (PBS)  
- Advice re food bolus risk  
  Smaller mouthfuls chew well avoid very dry bread/meat sips water with solids avoid late large meals <3h before bed ↓caffeine spicy fatty foods as able  

Red flag / safety net  
ED if unable to swallow saliva food stuck not passing severe chest pain not settling or SOB wheeze facial swelling  

2 Food allergy  
- Continue strict avoidance egg tree nuts for now  
- EpiPen 0.3mg prescribed today PBS  
  Brief education re use anaphylaxis signs breathing diff tongue/throat swell collapse widespread hives with breathing issues  
- Ref immunology/allergy clinic for  
  formal assessment egg/nut allergy  
  consider EoE interface  
  written anaphylaxis action plan  
  targeted SPT / sIgE as indicated  
- Dietitian ref (allergy / EoE experience) once dx clearer to avoid unnecessary restriction  

3 Anxiety / panic comp  
Explained difference between allergy sx (rash swelling food trigger) vs panic (hyperventilation racing thoughts non food)  
Suggested simple breathing / grounding techniques at work

4 Other issues  
Explained time limitation today advised book long appt for shoulder toenail contraception dizziness mole check pt agreed though tried to add few "quick" Qs redirected  

F/U  
R/v 2–3/52  
- check PPI response  
- r/v any interim choking/allergic events
