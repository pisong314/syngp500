RACF review – DM + eyes  

S: 72F T2DM ~6y. Here for BSL review per RN. c/o “sugars up & down” + “eyes a bit crusty”. No polyuria/polydipsia/wt loss/CP/SOB. Eyes: months of gritty/burning OU, worse am, crusting lids, mild redness. No photophobia, ↓VA, FB sensation, purulent d/c, severe pain. Hx recurrent “styes”.

O:  
- Vitals: BP 128/76, HR 76, RR 14, afeb, SpO₂ 99% RA. BMI ~29.  
- BSL chart (2/52): Fasting 6.8–9.5; pre-dinner 8–13, occas 15 post-prandial.  
- Eyes:  
  • Lids: erythematous margins, collarettes/crusts at lash base OU, mild thickening, few misdirected lashes.  
  • MGs: plugging/inspissation, turbid secretions on pressure, mild T. Frothy tear film.  
  • RUL 4–5mm firm NT nodule away from margin → c/w chalazion. No cellulitis.  
  • Conj: mild inj OU. Cornea clear on torch, no obvious ulcer. PERRL, EOMI.  

A:  
1) T2DM – suboptimal control, no acute complication. Need HbA1c / CMP.  
2) Chronic mixed ant/post blepharitis OU (±MGD).  
3) RUL chalazion, small, stable.  
4) Fall risk – recent mech fall (RACF).  

P:  

10:20 – DM  
- Ix (RACF collection):  
  • HbA1c  
  • Fasting lipids  
  • FBC, U&E, LFTs  
  • Urine ACR if able  
- Meds: ↑gliclazide MR 60mg mane → 90mg mane (1½ tabs) for BSL 8–15, no hypos reported. Continue metformin XR 1g nocte, atorvastatin 20mg nocte, PRN paracetamol.  
- RN: continue BSLs as per current protocol; flag hypos or BSL >18 → GP.  
- Plan long DM review 2–3/52 when bloods back (foot exam incl monofilament, BP targets, statin review, microvascular screen). Ask RACF to invite daughter.  

10:28 – Eyes  
- Dx blepharitis + MGD explained briefly.  
- Lid hygiene regimen (to add to RACF care plan):  
  • Warm compresses OU 2–5 min bd (clean warm cloth, not hot).  
  • Then gentle lid margin clean bd with commercial lid wipes OR bicarb soln (1 tsp/500mL boiled cooled water) on cotton bud – fresh daily.  
  • Gentle lid massage towards margin post-compress to express MGs.  
- No topical abx – no evidence superimposed infection.  
- Chalazion: conservative only (warm compress), no I&C indicated.  
- Red flag advice to staff: urgent GP/ED if ↑pain, marked swelling/erythema, ↓vision, photophobia, ↑d/c.  

Referrals:  
- Non-urgent optom/ophthal review 3–6/12 for VA, DR screen, review blepharitis/chalazion. RACF to discuss logistics with EPOA.  

FU: 2–3/52 GP review with results + reassess lids. If no improvement after ~4/52 good hygiene → consider doxycycline 100mg daily (then 50mg) ± ophthal input.  

RTC/ED earlier if BSLs very high with sx, or eye red flags.
