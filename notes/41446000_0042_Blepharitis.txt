Nil vitals (telehealth)  

# Assessment  
1 Bilateral blepharitis likely chronic mixed anterior/posterior SNOMED 41446000  
   Clinical picture consistent with lid margin inflammation with probable MGD  
   Burning grittiness worse later in day morning crusting mild erythema transient blur that improves with blinking  
   Age >50 raises suspicion of posterior blepharitis and possible Demodex involvement though cannot confirm without slit lamp  
   Currently mild–mod sx nil red flag features for keratitis acute glaucoma orbital cellulitis etc  

2 Hx recurrent chalazia  
   Supports underlying MGD and chronic posterior blepharitis  
   Nil current discrete lesion  

3 Telehealth constraints  
   Limited resolution prevents detailed assessment of lashes glands cornea  
   Plan for in person r/v if not settling or if red flag sx  

DDx considered  
– Dry eye disease evaporative type 2° MGD vs primary aqueous deficiency  
– Allergic conjunctivitis less likely given limited itch and minimal discharge  
– Infective conjunctivitis unlikely nil mucopurulent discharge nil contact spread hx  
– Rosacea blepharitis ? underlying ocular rosacea possible given facial flushing but no clear papulopustules on video  

# Plan  

Blepharitis / MGD management  
Education  
Explained chronic relapsing nature of blepharitis pathophys of MGD obstruction and tear film instability as per standard ophthalmic guidelines  
Expectation of gradual improvement over wks with regular lid care rather than immediate cure  

Lid hygiene  
– Warm compresses both eyes bd x at least 4/52 then daily maintenance  
  Clean face washer soaked in warm not hot water over closed lids 2–5 mins to soften secretions and crusts  
– Lid cleaning immediately after compress  
  Option 1 tea tree oil based  
   • 1 tsp 100% tea tree oil in 100 mL freshly boiled cooled water  
   • Use clean cotton bud/pad to gently clean along lash line upper and lower lids eyes closed  
   • Avoid solution in eye stop if marked sting prepare fresh daily  
  OR  
  Option 2 baby shampoo  
   • ~5 drops baby shampoo in 100 mL boiled cooled water  
   • As above gentle lid margin clean  
  Emphasised gentle technique clean materials discard leftover solution same day  

– Lid massage for posterior component  
  After compress gentle rolling massage of lids towards lash line to help express meibomian glands  

Lubrication  
– Adv to use preservative free artificial tears qid prn for dryness/grittiness pharmacist to assist brand selection suitable for frequent use  
– Avoid preserved drops >qid  

Makeup / environment  
– Remove eye makeup nightly esp mascara eyeliner  
– Avoid eyeliner on inner lash line  
– Suggested short "makeup holiday" few wks while sx active  
– Reduce continuous screen time 20–20–20 rule explained  
– Avoid direct aircon blowing at face adjust workstation if possible  

Demodex  
– Explained Demodex mites common >50yrs may contribute to chronic blepharitis  
– Tea tree oil based lid hygiene particularly useful aim is sx control not eradication  

Meds  
– Nil topical abx for now as nil evidence bacterial conjunctivitis or focal lid infection  
– Nil oral doxycycline at this stage reserve for refractory posterior blepharitis after ≥4–6/52 of good compliance with hygiene as per usual GP/ophthalmology practice  

Safety net / red flags  
Advised urgent in person r/v GP or ED/eye casualty if  
– Sudden ↑ eye pain esp unilateral or severe  
– Marked photophobia or inability to open eye due to pain  
– Sudden change or loss of vision or halos around lights  
– Rapidly ↑ lid swelling warmth fever systemic unwell ?preseptal/orbital cellulitis  
– Dense purulent discharge or eyelids glued shut  

Comorbid / other issues  
– Chalazia hx same warm compress massage regime to ↓ recurrence  
  If new persistent lump develops will need in person exam poss ophthal ref for I&C if recurrent  
– Unclear PMHx and meds "little white pill"  
  Asked pt to bring all med boxes and written list to next face to face appt for reconciliation and BP lipids check  

Fatigue  
Pt briefly mentioned feeling "abit more tired lately"  
Explained time limited today primary focus ocular sx suggested separate longer appt for general health review bloods etc  

Investigations  
Nil ordered today clinical dx via hx + limited exam  
Future in person consider BP check fasting lipids FBE TFTs etc once PMHx clarified  

Follow up  
– Non urgent face to face r/v this practice in 3–4/52  
  • Reassess blepharitis sx response to hygiene  
  • Full ocular exam incl VA lids lashes MGD assessment fluorescein if available  
  • Clarify PMHx meds CV risk factors  
– If persistent sx after 4–6/52 of good adherence esp ongoing grittiness signs of posterior blepharitis  
  • Consider doxycycline 100 mg mane for 6–8/52 then 50 mg mane depending response and tolerability  
  • Consider ophthal ref if recurrent chalazia diagnostic uncertainty or concern for corneal involvement  

Pt factors  
Poor historian timelines and med details vague  
Required repetition of lid hygiene steps  
Summarised plan pt able to repeat key points "warm cloth then tea tree mix on the lids twice a day and drops when it feels scratchy"  
Encouraged to write instructions down and pharmacist reinforcement
