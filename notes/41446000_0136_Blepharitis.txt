52F here re “blocked oil glands in my eyelids, eyes are really sore and gritty again”. Known rosacea/dry eyes/blepharitis from past notes. Says “I’ve been a bit slack, I keep forgetting the hot washer thing” and stopped drops “ages ago, just never got more”. Missed last 2 reviews.  

Symptoms last few weeks worse – burning, gritty, lids tender, both eyes, worse after long screen time + air con at work, and “bingeing Netflix at night”. Some crusting on lashes in the morning. No proper eye pain, no photophobia, no sudden visual loss, no curtain/flashers/floaters. No contacts. No trauma/chemicals. Wonders if “cheap mascara” or “the town water being funny” to blame.  

No regular meds, NKDA.  

Obs: BP 124/78, HR 76, afebrile, sats 99% RA.  

Eyes (brief):  
- VA with glasses 6/7.5 R, 6/7.5 L (same as old note)  
- Lid margins red, thickened both sides, more lower. Collarettes/scaling. Multiple capped meibomian glands, thick “toothpaste” secretions when pressed. Mild frothy tear film. No chalazion/stye today.  
- Mild conjunctival injection, corneas look clear on pen torch. EOM full, pupils normal, no obvious cellulitis.  

Dx:  
1) Chronic blepharitis (mixed ant/post) with meibomian gland dysfunction – flare, likely non-adherence  
2) Dry eye syndrome, worse with screen/air con  
3) Rosacea contributing to lid disease  

Plan (a bit all over the place, discussed at length):  
- Re-explained chronic nature: needs ongoing lid hygiene.  
- Lid care: warm compresses + lid massage + clean along lash line. Told her aim BD x 4 wks then daily. She says “I’ll try but I’m hopeless with routines”. Suggested commercial lid wipes instead of home mix to keep it simple.  
- Restart lubricating drops: artificial tears (e.g. hypromellose / polyvinyl alcohol) 1 gtt OU PRN up to QID, more on computer days.  
- Stop mascara/eyeliner for now, can try hypoallergenic later. Told unlikely due to tap water.  
- Doxycycline discussed for rosacea/posterior blepharitis (100 mg daily then down to 50 mg, total ~8 wks) if still bad next review; she “doesn’t like taking tablets, I just forget them”, so agreed to hold off and focus on hygiene + drops for 4–6 wks first.  
- No tests ordered today – clinical picture consistent with chronic blepharitis/dry eye, no red flags on exam.  

Safety net: urgent review/ED if sudden vision change, severe pain, marked photophobia, or increasing redness/swelling.  

Follow-up: booked 4–6 wks to reassess lids/dry eye and reconsider doxy if still symptomatic. Earlier if worse or can’t manage regime.  

10:02 – quick addendum: reminded her to set phone alarms and link routine to toothbrushing. She agreed “yeah that might be the only way I remember”.
