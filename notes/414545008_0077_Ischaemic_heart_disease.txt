Reason for visit  
F/U IHD AF/flutter PAD scripts general check up  

HPC  
72yo Anglo-Aust male retired construction worker regular pt known IHD atrial flutter PAD  
Very stoic tends to minimise sx says he “doesn’t want to be a bother” and has “put up with worse over the years”  

1 IHD / atrial flutter  
Says overall “going alright”  

Chest discomfort  
- Stable exertional sx only  
- Describes “a bit of tightness across the chest now and then if I really push it like hurrying for the bus”  
- Occurs on ↑ exertion predictable threshold relieved by rest in a few mins  
- Nil rest pain nil radiation nil diaphoresis nil syncope nil vomiting  
- Mild exertional SOB settles quickly with rest  
- Has PRN GTN spray has not used for >3/12 “dont like fussing with that spray”  

Palpitations  
- Intermittent brief episodes “fluttering in the chest” about once every 1–2/52 lasting a few mins self resolving  
- Nil presyncope nil syncope nil chest pain with these  
- Nil recent hosp admissions  
- No known HF dx  

Dyspnoea  
- Mild exertional only unchanged “I just go a bit slower these days”  
- Nil orthopnoea nil PND  
- Mild stable evening ankle swelling only as per baseline  

Meds (per record reconfirmed with pt though a bit vague re timing)  
- Aspirin 100mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
- Bisoprolol 5mg mane  
- Ramipril 5mg mane  
- Apixaban 5mg BD (for flutter)  
- GTN spray SL PRN  

Adherence  
- Generally compliant  
- Misses “the odd evening tablet if we’re out for tea” likely statin 1–2x/wk  

Pt theory  
- Wonders if “that stronger coffee my neighbour makes” might be “stirring the heart up a bit” re flutter episodes  

2 Peripheral arterial disease  
Known PAD with intermittent claudication  

- Calf tightness “legs just get a bit tight in the calves if I walk too far”  
- On flat ground sx ~150–200m relieved by rest within a few mins unchanged vs last r/v  
- Nil rest pain nil nocturnal foot pain nil non healing ulcers nil colour change  
- Notes feet “get a bit cold watching TV at night” wears thick socks  
- Nil acute limb sx nil recent vascular procedures  

Smoking / alcohol  
- Ex smoker quit ~5yrs ago no relapse  
- ETOH 1–2 beers on weekends  

3 Other concern  
- Mentions tap water “tasted a bit funny lately”  
- Thinks “maybe that’s why I feel a bit crook in the mornings”  
- On clarification “crook” = mild early morning tiredness only  
- Sleep 6–7h wakes once to void  
- Nil GI upset nil fevers nil wt loss  
- Acknowledged likely non contributory deferred detailed work up today time  

PMHx (relevant)  
- IHD with prior anteroseptal MI (per old ECG)  
- Paroxysmal atrial flutter  
- PAD intermittent claudication  
- HTN  
- Hyperlipidaemia  
- Nil known DM previous HbA1c WNL  

FHx  
- Not explored in detail today prev notes suggest FHx IHD in father  

SHx  
- Lives at home with wife independent ADLs  
- Drives walks to local shops most days limited formal exercise  
- On super + pension financially ok to attend appts  
- Wife reportedly encourages him to seek care he tends to say “I’m fine stop fussing”  

ROS (focused)  
- Cardiac as above  
- Resp nil cough wheeze pleuritic pain  
- Neuro nil focal weakness speech change  
- Vasc nil new claudication pattern nil rest pain nil ulceration  
- GU nil haematuria  
- GI nil abdo pain N/V PR bleed  
- Mood reports ok coping  

O/E  
Gen  
- Elderly male appears well slightly stooped chatty underplays sx “it’s nothing really”  

Obs  
- BP 128/72 sitting  
- HR 64 regular during exam  
- RR 16  
- SpO2 98% RA  
- Temp 36.6  
- BMI 27 kg/m² overweight stable vs prior  

CVS  
- JVP not ↑  
- HS dual S1 S2 nil murmur nil gallop nil added sounds  
- Rhythm regular today nil clinical flutter/fib at time of exam  
- Nil peripheral oedema mild venous stasis changes ankles only  

Resp  
- Lungs clear bilat nil wheeze nil creps  

Peripheral vascular  
- Feet warm intact skin nil ulcers nil gangrene  
- Cap refill toes <2s  
- DP pulses reduced bilat but palpable PT pulses difficult to palp  
- Nil calf tenderness nil asymmetrical swelling  

Neuro (feet)  
- LT sensation grossly intact  

Ix  
Today  
- ECG in rooms sinus rhythm ~62 bpm changes c/w old anteroseptal MI unchanged vs previous ECG on file nil acute ST-T changes nil flutter waves captured  
- Ordered bloods FBC U&E LFT fasting lipids HbA1c for annual CVD risk and med monitoring esp statin ACEi  

Recent results (3/25)  
- Lipids TC 3.8 LDL 1.7 HDL 1.2 TG 1.2 satisfactory on current tx  
- Renal eGFR 72 (stable vs prior 70–75 range) creat normal K 4.4  

Consider ABPI for PAD reassessment not done today time will arrange via nurse clinic if sx change or walking distance ↓  

Assessment  
1 IHD stable angina  
- Exertional chest tightness predictable threshold rapid relief with rest nil red flag features  
- On appropriate 2° prevention aspirin statin ACEi beta blocker anticoag for flutter  
- BP controlled lipids at target per 3/25 results repeat pending  

2 Paroxysmal atrial flutter rate controlled on anticoag  
- Brief intermittent palpitations only haemodynamically stable  
- Sinus rhythm today  
- Prior cardiology input per file ablation discussed deferred as sx mild LV function previously normal  
- Nil clinical HF orthopnoea PND oedema or pulmonary congestion  

3 PAD stable intermittent claudication  
- Claudication distance ~150–200m unchanged no features acute limb ischaemia or CLTI  
- On good CVD risk modification ex smoker antiplatelet statin BP control  

4 CVD risk factors  
- Ex smoker overweight limited structured exercise  
- BP lipids controlled on current regimen  
- Prior HbA1c normal rechecking to excl evolving DM  

5 Non specific early morning tiredness  
- Mild non disabling likely multifactorial age poor sleep quality etc  
- Nil red flags today deferred detailed work up longer appt  

Plan  
1 IHD / atrial flutter  
- Continue current meds  
  • Aspirin 100mg daily  
  • Apixaban 5mg BD reconfirmed nil bleeding nil falls counselled to seek urgent r/v if melena haematuria haemoptysis or significant bruising  
  • Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
  • Bisoprolol 5mg mane  
  • Ramipril 5mg mane  
  • GTN SL PRN chest pain reminded use 1 spray rest repeat after 5min if needed call ambulance if pain not settled within 10min or assoc severe SOB syncope feeling “very unwell”  
- Emphasised importance consistent statin use even when out for tea suggested weekly pill organiser link dose to regular evening routine TV etc  
- Discussed caffeine as possible trigger for palps advised limit strong coffee to 1–2 cups/day monitor pattern  

- Rhythm control  
  • No immediate change given mild sx stable status  
  • Order TTE (last >2yrs ago) to reassess LV function screen for arrhythmia related cardiomyopathy  
  • If echo shows ↓EF or palps ↑ frequency or severity will re refer to cardiology to reconsider rhythm control / ablation  

2 PAD  
- Reassured no evidence acute limb ischaemia or CLTI currently  
- Encourage structured walking program aim ~30min most days walking to near max tolerable claudication then rest repeat to promote collaterals  
- Continue aspirin statin BP control smoking cessation maintained  
- Education re red flags sudden severe leg pain colour change pale/blue cold limb loss of sensation or movement → ED/000  
- Foot care discussed daily inspection moisturise avoid barefoot early r/v for sores blisters  
- Vascular ref if claudication distance ↓ significantly or any rest pain/tissue loss  

3 Monitoring / Ix  
- Await bloods echo  
- Will contact pt by phone if significant abn otherwise discuss next r/v  
- If e-lyte abn esp K/Mg will address promptly given arrhythmia risk  

4 Deferred / preventative  
- Did not complete full geriatric / preventative screen today time  
- Asked pt to book longer appt next 1–2 mths for general health review incl vaccinations cancer screening mood sleep etc he somewhat reluctant “I’ll come if I have to” wife reportedly keen so suggested she attend as well  

Safety net  
- Advised 000 / ED if  
  • Chest pain at rest or not settling within 10min of GTN/rest  
  • New or markedly ↑ SOB esp at rest or lying flat  
  • Sudden marked palps with dizziness syncope chest pain  
  • Sudden severe leg pain cold/pale limb or loss of movement/sensation  
- Reinforced “better safe than sorry with the heart and circulation”  

F/U  
- Routine GP r/v 3/12 for CVD follow up or earlier if sx change  
- Separate longer appt 1–2/12 for broader health review and to go through results in person if he prefers
