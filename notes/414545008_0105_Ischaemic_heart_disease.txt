76M IHD + pAF review / “general check-up, bit worried about my heart”  

HPC  
2–3/52 intermittent brief L chest “twinges” few secs only, often at rest (TV/bed), non-exertional, no SOB, no N/V, no diaphoresis  
Still walks dog 20–30min most days no CP, no ↓ex tol  
No presyncope/syncope, no orthopnoea/PND, no ankle swelling  
Very anxious, lots of Dr Google – “worried this could be cancer or heart failure starting” “are you sure we’re not missing anything?” asking for “full body scan”  

PMHx (problem list – prev note 03/05/23 15/08/24)  
- IHD – stable angina, med mx only, last cards ~8/12 ago  
- AF (paroxysmal) NVAF on rate control + NOAC  
- HTN, HLD  
- No known HF, last echo ~1 yr ago reportedly normal LV fx  

Meds (unchanged)  
Apixaban 5mg BD  
Metoprolol succ 47.5mg mane  
Perindopril 5mg mane  
Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
GTN spray PRN (not used for months)  
Good adherence – Webster, no missed doses x2/52  

O/E  
Anxious but well, speaking full sentences  
BP 128/72 R arm sitting  
HR 76 reg (no obvious ectopy)  
RR 16 SpO₂ 97% RA T 36.6  
CVS HS dual, no m/r, JVP not ↑, no oedema, periph pulses +, warm  
Chest clear  

Ix today  
ECG in rooms: SR ~72, normal axis, no acute ST/T ∆, old inf Q waves same as prior ECG, no fast AF, no acute ischaemia  
Path ordered (routine / reassurance): FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, HbA1c, TFTs – on-site collection  

A  
1) IHD – clinically stable  
   - Atypical brief non-exertional “twinges” likely non-cardiac / anxiety / MSK  
   - Obs + ECG reassuring, good functional capacity, no red flag sx  
2) AF hx – currently SR, rate controlled, on apixaban  
   - No palps today, no HF signs  
3) Health anxiety / reassurance seeking  
   - Heavy internet use, catastrophising re CP (“cancer”, “small heart attack”, “HF starting”)  
4) CVD risk factors – partial review only today (time)  

P  
- Reassured re current sx – no features of ACS/unstable angina today  
- Continue current meds: apixaban, metoprolol, perindopril, atorva, GTN PRN  
- GTN plan reiterated: 1 spray SL for concerning CP; if need >3 sprays / >10min or severe / assoc SOB, sweat, N/V → call 000 / ED  
- Clear red flag advice: prolonged or exertional CP, SOB, collapse, new neuro sx → ED  
- Caffeine: advised ↓ to ≤2 cups coffee/day, esp instant, may help with “jumpy” heart  
- Discussed no indication for “full body scan”; potential harm from over-investigation explained  
- Health anxiety: validated concerns, suggested CBT/psychology; pt to “think about it” and talk with wife  
- Plan repeat echo only if HF sx develop or cards suggests at next review – not urgent now  

F/U  
- Long appt 2/52 to review bloods, recheck sx, full CVD risk review, consider MHCP + psych referral  
- RTC earlier / ED as above if worse
