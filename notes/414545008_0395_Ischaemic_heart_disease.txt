22/11/25 AH review  

78M new pt – L shoulder pain  
“I’ve only got 10 mins doc just need something so I can sleep”  

HPC  
L lat/post shoulder ache x ~5/7  
↑ pain abduction >~90°, reaching behind back, overhead work, lying L side  
No clear trauma – ↑ gardening, “tightening bolts on the ute”, maybe slept funny in recliner  
Pain 6/10 w movement, 2/10 rest, wakes 1–2x/night  
No neck pain, no radiation past elbow, no paraesthesia, no weakness  

Screen – cardiac / neuro (hx IHD / stent, stroke, AF/flutter, PAD)  
No chest/jaw/central pressure  
No SOB, orthopnoea, PND  
No palps, presyncope/syncope  
No neuro sx (no speech/vision/weakness)  
Pain clearly mech/movement-related, not exertional  

PMHx (pt report only – no records tonight)  
IHD – PCI/stent ~6–7y ago, stable, “heart’s been fine”  
Ischaemic stroke ~3y ago – no obvious residual  
Atrial flutter – on OAC, prior cardioversion (“zappy thing”)  
PAD – angioplasty “balloon in one leg”  
?HF – pt denies being told “weak heart”  

Meds (uncertain doses – to confirm w usual GP)  
Aspirin 100 mane  
Atorvastatin (“strong one”) nocte  
Likely apixaban 5 bd (“blood thinner starting with A”)  
Beta blocker (prob metoprolol) od  
“Water tablet” mane (diuretic)  
PRN paracetamol 500 mg 1–2 tabs  

Allergies: NKDA (per pt)  

Exam  
Obs: BP 136/74 HR 76 reg RR16 SpO₂ 97% RA T 36.7 BMI ~27  
CVS/resp brief – dual HS, no added sounds, lungs clear, no oedema  
Neuro grossly non-focal UL/LL, speech/face ok  

L shoulder  
No deformity/erythema/swelling  
TTP anterolat shoulder (subacromial/GT region), no AC jt or bony tenderness  
Active abd limited ~90–100° due pain, + painful arc 70–110°  
Passive ROM slightly > but still painful  
+ve Jobe/empty can pain but power preserved  
+ve Hawkins impingement  
Neck full ROM, Spurling -, no radicular sx  

Ix  
No imaging on-site AH  
ECG offered (given IHD) – pt declined (“no time, shoulder’s the problem”)  

Impression  
L shoulder pain – rotator cuff tendinopathy / subacromial impingement likely  
Cardiac / cervical / red flag pathology unlikely on hx + exam but sig vascular hx noted  

Plan  
– Analgesia  
  • Advise regular paracetamol 1 g qid (max 4 g/day)  
  • Avoid oral NSAIDs (age, IHD, stroke, PAD, OAC, ?diuretic)  
  • Ok to try topical NSAID gel to shoulder if usual GP happy / no skin issues  

– Non-drug  
  • Relative rest – avoid heavy overhead work x 1–2/52, keep gentle ROM  
  • Heat pack prn  
  • Brief demo pendulum / gentle wall-slide ex’s  

– F/up  
  • See usual GP 1–2/52 for review, confirm meds, consider L shoulder XR +/- USS, physio, poss subacromial steroid if ongoing  
  • Usual GP to continue chronic IHD / stroke / AF / PAD management – pt encouraged to bring med list/boxes  

Red flag advice (brief – pt rushing)  
If new central chest pain/pressure, SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, pain not clearly movement-related OR sudden neuro sx (weakness, speech/vision change, facial droop) → call 000 / ED  
If shoulder becomes acutely red/hot/swollen or unable to move at all → urgent review  

RTC / ED if worse or any concern.
