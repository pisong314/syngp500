22/11/25 TH video – f/up – regional NSW  

57F f/up nails/skin + “general check‑over” but many extra issues → advised today focus nails/psoriasis only, book long appt for rest

Onychomycosis  
- Toenails thick/yellow/crumbly ~18/12, mainly big toes

- Lab: microscopy +ve hyphae; culture T. rubrum  
- No known liver dz, ETOH ~3–4 std/wk, no reg meds, NKDA  
- Worried re “spreading to skin/psoriasis” and “gangrene” → reassured benign, chronic, low cellulitis risk, essentially nil gangrene risk w/o PVD/DM  

Psoriasis/dermatitis  
- Longstanding scalp/extensor psoriasis + flexural dermatitis  
- On desonide, betamethasone valerate lotion, sorbolene PRN  
- Today: mild flare shins/behind ears, no ooze, no systemic sx  
- Discussed nail psoriasis vs fungal → culture‑confirmed dermatophyte, both may coexist

- Psoriasis >10y  
- Atopic/irritant dermatitis  
- Perimenopausal sx, now amenorrhoeic  
- No known DM, IHD, CKD, liver dz

Exam (TH, limited)  
- Well, NAD on screen  
- Toenails (video): great toes opaque yellow thickened, distal crumble/onycholysis ~40–50% R, 30–40% L, some 2nd toes; no obvious periungual erythema/pus  
- Visible skin: small erythematous scaly plaques shins c/w psoriasis, no cellulitis  

Dx  
1) Onychomycosis toenails – T. rubrum, mod involvement  
2) Psoriasis/dermatitis – mild flare, stable overall  
3) Multiple other minor issues (shoulder pain, sleep, bowels, taste, eyebrow thinning etc) – not addressed today, needs long f/up  

Plan  
Onychomycosis  
- Discussed options: topical vs oral; given extent + pt pref → oral terbinafine if bloods OK  
- Risks explained briefly: hepatotox (rare), GI upset, rash, taste disturbance, DDI (none signif)  
- Ix: baseline LFT, FBC ordered (path form emailed)  
- If LFTs N → start terbinafine 250 mg PO daily 12/52 (eScript to be sent after results)  
- Repeat LFTs 4–6/52 after start or earlier if jaundice, dark urine, RUQ pain, severe fatigue, rash → stop med + urgent review if these  
- Foot care advice briefly – keep nails short, dry feet, no nail salon on affected nails, cont topical antifungal between toes PRN tinea  

Psoriasis/dermatitis  
- Cont current topicals:  
  - Desonide to flexures short bursts  
  - Betamethasone valerate lotion to scalp short courses with breaks  
  - Sorbolene bd  
- Gentle skin care reinforced (soap‑free etc – brief)  

General health / screening (very brief)  
- Wt/BP not done (TH) → next F2F / pharmacy  
- Cervical screen ~3y ago – confirm/organise at future visit  
- Breast screen ~18/12 ago N  
- FOBT kit at home but not done → encouraged to complete, re‑order if lost  
- More detailed CV risk, lipids, glucose etc → separate “health check” appt (long)  

Other issues  
- Pt repeatedly raising extra concerns from list → advised need long appt to do properly  
- Asked to prioritise 1–2 issues (suggest shoulder pain + sleep) → book long f/up 2–4/52  

Safety net  
- Red flags feet: ↑redness, warmth, swelling, pain, fever, streaking up leg → urgent review/ED  
- RTC if any prob with terbinafine or nails worsening  

F/up  
- TH 1–2/52 to review LFT/FBC and, if OK, commence terbinafine (eScript)  
- Review ~6/52 after starting (TH or F2F) + repeat LFTs  
- F2F ~3/12 after start to assess nail growth; consider derm referral if no proximal clear nail or worsening  
- Book separate long appt 2–4/52 for shoulder/sleep/bowels etc  

Pt agrees, understands plan  

[Added 16:30 by Dr K. Smith – pathology results received]  
- LFT: within normal limits (ALT 22, AST 24, ALP 78, GGT 32, bili 9)  
- FBC N (Hb 134, WCC 6.1, Plt 270)  
→ OK to commence terbinafine 250 mg daily x 12/52 as per above. eScript sent.  
Msg via MyGov/HotDoc: start med, repeat LFTs 4–6/52, stop and see GP/ED if jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue, abdo pain, rash.
