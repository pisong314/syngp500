Plan  

Abdo pain  
Reassured re current benign exam serious pathology less likely discussed bowel ca risk age etc  
Simple analgesia paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
Advise fluids light bland diet next 24-48h avoid heavy/fatty foods excess caffeine ETOH  

Safety net  
Advised r/v GP 48-72h if pain ongoing or any new sx  
ED if severe or ↑ pain esp localising w rebound/guarding fever vomiting PR blood black stool difficulty passing urine new testicular pain chest pain SOB presyncope or generally very unwell  

Ix (if sx persist >1/52 or recur)  
To consider FBC U&E LFT CRP urinalysis +/- MSU  

Toenails  
Explained likely fungal nail inf however ~50% thick nails non fungal so need confirm prior PO antifungal small but real liver risk  
Pt "If we’re going to do it Id rather do the proper tablets than muck around for ages with paint"  

Today  
Nail clippings R and L great toes + subungual scrapings sent fungal M/C/S  
Baseline LFTs ordered ALT AST ALP GGT bili albumin in view possible oral terbinafine  

Education  
Keep nails trimmed short  
Keep feet dry at work change socks if damp consider more breathable socks  
Avoid digging under nail w sharp objects  

If fungal confirmed and LFTs ok  
Plan terbinafine 250mg PO daily 12/52 as first line  
Discussed potential AEs GI upset rash rare hepatotox need to stop and see GP if jaundice dark urine severe abdo pain unexplained fatigue  
Explained cure rates not 100% ~60% mycological cure recurrence possible importance of foot hygiene esp given damp boots  

F/U  
R/v 3-5/7 if abdo pain persists or earlier if worse  
Routine f/u 1-2/52 for  
- LFT results  
- Nail M/C/S results  
If dermatophyte confirmed + LFTs acceptable will start terbinafine 250mg daily x 12/52 arrange rpt LFTs 4-6/52  

Suggested longer appt next visit for toenail tx start + preventive health eg bowel ca screening weight management
