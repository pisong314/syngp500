24/11/25  walk-in, new pt, bulk billed  

24F, casual retail + uni. Here mainly for cough “about 10 days now”.

Initially dry, now small amounts clear/white sputum. Worse at night/early morning. No SOB, no chest pain, no fevers. Says “I can still walk to uni fine, just coughing heaps”. Had blocked nose + mild sore throat first few days, now mostly gone. No haemoptysis. No hx asthma, pneumonia.

Non-smoker, no vapes, no recent o/s travel. RAT neg day 3 and 7. Viral URTI going around at work (shopping centre, fashion retail, lots of aircon). Thinks aircon + iced coffees make it worse. Using random OTC cough mix with little benefit. Paracetamol PRN earlier in illness, none last 48 hrs.

PMHx: retinopathy of prematurity – laser as baby, followed in childhood, now just glasses, vision stable by her report. Nil other chronic issues, no regular meds. NKDA.

O/E  
Looks well, chatting in full sentences, coughing intermittently.  
T 36.9, HR 82, BP 112/68, RR 16, SpO₂ 99% RA.  
Throat a bit red, no exudate. Chest: good AE, no wheeze, no crackles, no focal signs. CVS normal.

Imp:  
1) Subacute cough ~10 days, likely post-viral URTI. No red flags, obs normal, chest clear. No indication for abx.  
2) Hx ROP, treated infancy, stable by hx – not main focus today.

Plan today (cough):  
- Reassured likely viral/post-viral, may take another 1–2 weeks to settle.  
- No abx. Pt happy to avoid “unnecessary antibiotics”.  
- Symptomatic only: fluids, simple analgesia if needed (paracetamol up to 4 g/day max).  
- For night cough: suggested honey, humidification; if still very bothersome can try short course sedating antihistamine at night (e.g. promethazine OTC) – warned re drowsiness, no driving.  
- Avoid spending $$ on multiple cough mixtures.

No investigations today – low risk, pt also keen to avoid extra costs.

Safety net: RTC/ED if fevers, SOB at rest, chest pain, coughing blood, or if clearly worsening. Review if not improving over next ~2 weeks; if >4–6 weeks or new features, consider CXR/spirometry/other workup.

ROP: briefly discussed, advised continue annual optom checks, consider ophthalmology review at some stage. Suggested separate longer appt after exams to go through this + general preventative care. Pt agreeable.
