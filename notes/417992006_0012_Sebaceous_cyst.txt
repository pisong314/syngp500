- Also queries harness rubbing "maybe from that"  
- Specific ? re malignancy "Should I be worried about it turning into cancer"  

Extensive discussion held re likely dx epidermoid (sebaceous) cyst vs lipoma vs dermal naevus vs adnexal tumour vs much less likely cutaneous metastasis or other skin ca  
Explained clinical features reassuring for benign cyst central punctum mobile lesion long hx slow growth nil systemic features nil ulceration or pigment change  

Reassured that sweat/friction may irritate but not main cause

Assessment  
1 Sebaceous (epidermoid) cyst upper back  
   - Typical hx long standing slowly enlarging  
   - Classic exam incl central punctum mobile lesion  
   - Nil clinical red flags for malignancy or infection today  

   Differentials discussed in detail with pt for medico-legal clarity  
   - Epidermoid cyst most likely  
   - Lipoma  
   - Pilar cyst less likely given location  
   - Benign adnexal tumour  
   - Very low prob BCC/SCC or other skin ca given non pigmented intact skin no ulceration no rapid growth  

2 General preventive health  
   - First visit to this practice  
   - BP wnl BMI overweight range  
   - Outdoor work → ↑ lifetime skin ca risk  

Plan  

1 Sebaceous cyst  
- Explained benign nature blocked skin gland not a cancer very low risk malignant change emphasised repeatedly  
- Explained natural hx may stay same slowly ↑ or become inflamed infected  
- Management options discussed at length  
  a) Watchful waiting  
  b) Elective excision under LA in rooms  
  c) If acutely inflamed may need I&D ± abx rather than formal excision initially  

- Pt preference "If it’s easy enough I’d rather get it taken out before it gets bigger"  

- Discussed risks of excision  
  - Scar formation cosmetic outcome not guaranteed  
  - Recurrence if sac not fully removed  
  - Bleeding bruising haematoma  
  - Infection wound dehiscence delayed healing  
  - Need for sutures and suture removal  
  - Rare allergy to LA vasovagal etc  

- Pt given opportunity to ask questions all answered to best of ability  
- Pt verbalises understanding states "yeah that all makes sense" and keen to proceed  
- Formal informed consent for excision to be obtained again on procedure day  

- Plan  
  - Book long minor op appt 30min in next 4–6/52 for excision under LA in practice  
  - No imaging indicated currently typical appearance nil red flags discussed that if rapid change before procedure may reconsider imaging or earlier r/v  
  - Specimen to be sent for histopathology post excision to confirm dx documented and discussed today pt agrees  

- Safety netting extensive  
  Advised urgent r/v or ED if  
  - Rapid ↑ in size esp over days  
  - ↑ pain redness warmth swelling  
  - Pus discharge or foul smell  
  - Fever >38 or feeling systemically unwell  
  - Any new skin changes pigment change ulceration bleeding from lesion  
  Pt able to repeat back red flag sx in own words "if it gets angry hot or starts leaking or I feel crook come straight back"

- Provided printed info sheet on epidermoid cysts (Healthdirect printout) noted in file  
- Pt advised to read at home bring any further questions to next appt

Plan
