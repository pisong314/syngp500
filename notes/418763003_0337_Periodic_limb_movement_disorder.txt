58F f/up cough + sleep / leg movts. Daughter interpreting (pt limited Eng).  

C/O  
- Cough ~10/7. Started dry → now mild ↑sputum (clear/white). Worse lying flat, wakes her. “Chest noisy” per daughter  
- No SOB, no pleuritic CP, no haemoptysis, no fevers/chills  
- Mild sore throat early, now resolved  
- Non-smoker, no known lung dz  
- Pt query “cold air / window open” + “tap water” cause  

Sleep / RLS  
- Known RLS / PLMS + chronic insomnia  
- On pramipexole 0.25mg nocte + melatonin MR 2mg nocte  
- Still 2–3 nights/wk bad legs, now worse sleep with cough. Daytime tired  
- No new neuro red flags (no weakness, no bowel/bladder issues)  
- No change meds, no known CKD, ?iron status (last >2 yrs ago per old note)  

O/E  
Obs OK: BP 132/78 HR 82 RR 16 SpO2 98% RA afebrile  
Looks well, talking full sentences, intermittent cough  
Chest clear, good AE, no wheeze/creps  
Throat mild erythema only  

IMP  
1) Subacute cough – likely post-viral URTI / UACS. No red flags, chest clear, vitals stable  
2) RLS / PLMS + chronic insomnia – partial control on low-dose pramipexole, ?secondary causes not recently checked  
3) Language barrier – relies on daughter; some nodding without clear understanding  

PLAN  
1) Cough  
- Reassure benign course, may last few/52  
- Symptomatic only:  
  → Paracetamol PRN (already using)  
  → OK to try simple OTC linctus / glycerol mix PRN  
  → Non-pharm (fluids, honey etc discussed briefly)  
- RTC / ED if ↑SOB, pleuritic CP, haemoptysis, fever >38, worsening / not settling 1–2/52  
- Consider CXR if cough >4–6/52 or new red flags  

2) RLS / PLMS / insomnia  
- No obvious med triggers (no antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, opioids)  
- Reinforce pramipexole timing 1–2h pre-bed  
- Sleep hygiene briefly (daughter translating)  
- Ix ordered today: FBC, iron studies, U&E/Cr/eGFR, fasting lipids + BSL (last >2 yrs)  
- Plan: review results + RLS control longer appt; consider iron replacement if ferritin low/low-normal; may need pramipexole dose ↑ vs switch (e.g. gabapentin/pregabalin) – defer today  

3) Comms  
- Suggested TIS / prof interpreter next visit in addition to daughter  
- Used basic teach-back via daughter re red flags + meds – still some nodding  

Meds today  
- No change to pramipexole 0.25mg nocte (review after bloods)  
- Melatonin MR 2mg nocte cont  
- OK paracetamol PRN  
(No PBS authority issues)  

F/U  
- Review 2/52 (book longer 20–30min) → cough progress + bloods + RLS/insomnia plan  
- Earlier if worse resp sx  

Std consult ~15min – detailed insomnia / CV risk discussion deferred to next visit.
