A  
1) Chronic venous ulcer L gaiter – stable, no red flag features, no overt cellulitis, no acute arterial compromise  
2) Health anxiety / high illness worry – fixated on "cancer" / "blood poisoning" / "CT to check everything"  
3) ?CKD – on ACEi + diuretic, stage unclear – needs usual GP review  
4) HTN – appears reasonable today  
5) Compression – unclear prior ABPI / vascular workup → avoid changing compression tonight  

P  
– Reassured re no signs sepsis / acute ischaemia today. Explained no single "cancer blood test"  
– Limited but reasonable bloods today (pt very keen):  
  • FBC  
  • UEC/eGFR  
  • CRP, ESR  
  • HbA1c  
  • LFTs  
Results → fax to usual GP (pt gave name + suburb)  

– Wound care tonight: cleaned with NaCl, non-adherent absorbent dressing applied. Advised STOP plastic wrap at night (↑ maceration/inf risk)  
– Elevation when resting, gentle ankle movements – brief discussion only  
– Compression: has "tight stockings" at home – told not to self-escalate. Needs ABPI / vascular check with usual GP/nurse before any change  

Meds  
– Continue paracetamol 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/day)  
– Avoid NSAIDs given ?CKD  
– No oral abx – no systemic features, no clear cellulitis. Explained would treat if ↑ redness, pain, fever etc  

F/up  
– Strongly advised extended appt with usual GP in 3–5/7 to:  
  • Review these bloods  
  • Clarify CKD stage + full med list  
  • Arrange ABPI / vascular duplex if not done  
  • Formal compression + ongoing wound plan (GP/community nurse)  
  • Address anxiety properly, poss psych support if ongoing  
– Asked to bring all meds + stockings/dressings to that appt  

Safety net (brief)  
ED/urgent review if:  
– Rapidly ↑ pain esp at rest  
– Sudden colour change (black/blue), blisters, foul smell  
– Rapidly spreading redness/warmth up leg  
– Fever/rigors/feels very crook, SOB, CP, whole leg swells  

Pt still somewhat anxious, repeated "are you sure we're not missing cancer?" – re-explained low suspicion currently, biopsy if future change in appearance → GP to organise if needed
