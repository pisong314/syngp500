Assessment  

1 Likely viral URTI vs mild allergic rhinitis flare  
Short duration 4/7 clear rhinorrhoea sneezing nasal obstruction itchy eyes benign exam nil fever  
Hx hayfever plus possible triggers (aircon jasmine) suggests allergic component  
Recent contact with coughing colleagues → viral contribution also plausible  
Nil red flags bacterial sinusitis – nil high fever nil severe facial or tooth pain nil purulent d/c >7–10/7  
Nil clinical indication for abx as per national primary care URTI guidance  

2 BV (SNOMED CT 419760006) with Trichomonas vaginalis recent treated clinically improved  
Completed 1st line oral metronidazole regimen as per sexual health guidelines  
Sx largely resolved partner reportedly treated concurrent abstinence maintained → ↓ risk reinfection  
Current picture not c/w persistent infection  
Full STI screen 2/52 ago all neg  
Discussed recurrence risk and modifiable factors  

Plan  

#1 Sneezing nasal congestion  
- Continue saline nasal spray prn  
- Trial non sedating antihistamine 2' possible allergic rhinitis  
  • Cetirizine 10mg PO mane prn up to once daily for 5–7/7 then prn  
- Simple analgesia eg paracetamol if sinus pressure or HA develops  
- Non pharm  
  • Advise minimise direct aircon exposure where possible  
  • Usual rest fluids avoid smoke etc (briefly discussed)  

Safety net  
- R/V if  
  • onset high fevers  
  • worsening facial or tooth pain  
  • purulent nasal d/c >7–10/7  
  • SOB CP  
  • or sx persist >~2/52 without improvement  
- RAT for COVID if systemic sx or lower resp sx develop  

#2 BV / Trichomonas f/u  
- Nil repeat abx at this stage given resolution sx good adherence  
- Explained mild ↑ normal clear discharge can occur post tx as vaginal microbiome re equilibrates  
- Education  
  • avoid douching perfumed vaginal products  
  • continue condom use especially next few mths to ↓ recurrence and other STIs  
  • if discharge odour itch pelvic pain or dysuria recur → both pt and partner need reassessment and likely re testing and tx  
- Documented prior STI results HIV syphilis chlamydia gonorrhoea all neg  
- No further tests ordered today  

Contraception  
- Briefly revisited options COCP POP implant hormonal IUD vs copper IUD  
- Noted copper IUD associated with ↑ BV recurrence risk so would avoid if recurrent BV issue  
- Time limited today advised separate longer appt for detailed contraception counselling and cervical screen status check pt agreeable  

Preventive / Admin  
- Deferred broader preventive health review (lipids BSL etc) to later dedicated appt  
- Review 7–10/7 PRN if nasal sx not settling earlier if red flags  
- F/U PRN re vaginal sx  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to repeat plan back coherantly “use the saline and antihistamine for the nose come back if it drags on and if the discharge or smell comes back we check again and maybe treat both of us”
