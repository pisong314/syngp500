Plan  
1) Immunisation  
- discussed 10yrly tetanus booster dTpa preferred  
- dTpa Boostrix 0.5mL IM L deltoid given by nurse after consent documented in AIR  
- advised may get local pain swelling low risk systemic sx can use paracetamol  
- flu + COVID booster briefly discussed pt declined today says no time advised nurse appt later PRN  

2) Cyst  
- re explained likely epidermoid cyst benign not soap related changing wash unlikely to help  
- reassured nil infective features currently advised avoid picking squeezing to ↓risk infection inflammation  
- options discussed  
  - conservative watchful waiting  
  - surgical excision under LA in rooms if ↑size bothersome or recurrently inflamed explained small scar risk infection recurrence  
- pt wanted "just drain it today" explained simple drainage → high recurrence need full excision booked proc slot not possible in this short vax appt  
- offered excision in minor ops clinic w nurse + GP vs ref to local surgeon (would mean more travel wait)  
- given attendance issues negotiated time to suit work front desk to book 30min proc appt ~3–4/52  
- documented understanding re risk recurrence infection if not excised pt "if it doesnt annoy me too much I might just leave it"  
- nil abx indicated nil imaging  

3) Adherence / admin  
- brief chat re DNA pattern barriers work hrs distance  
- suggested first/last appt of day SMS reminders mobile confirmed consented  
- pt still abit ambivalent but agreed to at least one excision booking  

Safety net

- general advice RTC ED if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion etc  

F/U  
- booked nurse + GP proc appt ~3–4/52 for cyst excision (attendance ? )  
- flu COVID vax nurse appt when work allows pt to book PRN  

Time  
- std 10–15min consult prioritised vax brief skin r/v other prev health deferred to later R/V
