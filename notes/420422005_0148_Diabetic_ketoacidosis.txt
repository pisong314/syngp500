   Hyperglycaemia + sig ketosis + dehydration + tachycardia + polyuria polydipsia mild abdo discomfort recent illness oral agents only → likely DKA 2° relative insulin deficiency  
   Currently haemodynamically borderline but stable GCS 15

   Likely muscular / degenerative work related  
   Nil neuro red flags currently imaging not urgent

   Likely need regimen escalation post hosp poss insulin  

P / Plan  
DKA – urgent management and transfer  
- Explained to pt and partner findings very concerning for "diabetic acid" build up ie DKA need hosp Rx IV fluids insulin close monitoring emphasised seriousness pt said "didn’t realise it could get this bad"  
- Called QAS urgent transfer to regional ED ~90min away priority  
- While awaiting ambos  
  • moved to treatment room  
  • obs q10–15min remained similar  
  • NBM except small sips water  
  • O2 not required SpO2 99% RA  
  • IV access / insulin not started here will commence in ED as per local DKA protocol  

Handover to ED MO by phone  
- 54yo Aboriginal man T2DM on metformin/gliclazide  
- 2–3/7 polyuria polydipsia malaise nausea mild upper abdo pain headache  
- Exam mild dehydration HR 112 BP 102/68 afebrile 37.3 RR 22 sats 99% RA  
- BGL 25.4 ketones 3.6 urine 3+ glu 2+ ketones  
- Nil CP SOB sepsis features source infection not obvious  
- Request DKA workup ABG/VBG UEC bicarbonate anion gap FBC CRP cultures if ?sepsis ECG CXR  
- Asked for diabetes / endo input and check for precipitant incl infection MI etc  

Meds  
- Continue usual oral DM meds until reviewed in ED likely to be held once IV insulin started  
- For back pain ok to continue paracetamol 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h  
- Advised avoid NSAIDs if renal function impaired to be reviewed hosp  

Back pain  
- Explained current unwellness mainly from sugars not the back "back is annoying but sugars are the worry today"  
- No imaging today due to acute metabolic issue and nil red flags  
- Brief advice re manual handling at work physio referral to be arranged post discharge with usual GP  

Education & safety net  
- Spent time explaining in simple terms that when insulin not working body burns fat → ketones → blood too acidic → dehydration feeling very crook  
- Discussed need for future sick day plan reg BSL + ketone checks once has new meter  
- Pt verbalised understanding "if I start weeing heaps and get this thirsty again I come straight back or ED" reinforced call 000 if worsening confusion chest pain SOB vomiting or if unable to keep fluids down  

F/U  
- Requested hosp send d/c summary to usual GP Dr Patel  
- Advised pt to book r/v with Dr Patel within 3–5/7 of discharge to  
  • go through hosp course meds changes esp if insulin started  
  • organise new glucometer BSL + ketone monitoring  
  • full diabetes review care plan feet + eye checks  
  • reassess back pain physio / workplace mods as needed  

New pt to me acute issue addressed safety advice given suggest close F/U with regular GP Dr Patel after hosp stay and earlier if any concern  

Time  
Long consult >40min incl coordination with ambulance ED handover
