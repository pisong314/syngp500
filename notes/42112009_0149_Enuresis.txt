24yo M review – urinary issues / bedwetting  

Seen last week re new LUTS. Today mainly f/up + bladder diary.  
Pt says still “waking up in a wet bed 4–5 nights a week”, large volumes, usually around 3–5am. Daytime going every 1–2 hrs, feels “like I’m never properly empty”. Hesitancy, weak stream, has to strain, post‑void dribbling, odd small leak if holds too long. Ongoing ~6–8/12, worse last 3/12. Enuresis on/off for ~1 yr, now most nights. No dysuria, no haematuria, no fevers, no flank or suprapubic pain. No neuro Sx volunteered – specifically denies leg weakness, numbness, saddle anaesthesia, visual change. Very well read, asking about “overflow incontinence” and “neurogenic bladder/early MS”.  

Prev visit: dipstick clear (no blood, no LE/nitrite, no glucose, SG 1.020). No known DM, renal or neuro hx. No meds.  

Bladder diary (only 3 days done): 8–11 voids/day, mostly 150–250 mL, a couple up to ~350 mL. 0–1 nocturnal voids but wet bed 2/3 nights, big volumes. Drinking ~2–2.5 L incl 3 coffees, last ~6–7pm. Tried evening fluid restriction with little change.  

Exam today (brief – focused):  
Obs fine: BP 118/72, HR 72, afebrile, BMI 23.  
Abdo soft, no palpable bladder. Ext genitalia/testes normal, no obvious meatal stenosis.  
Screen neuro LL grossly normal power/reflexes/sensation, gait normal. No back tenderness. DRE discussed again re outlet obstruction – pt still declines for now.  

Impression (messy):  
– Nocturnal enuresis + daytime LUTS in young male. Chronic, gradual. Looks more like non‑neurogenic LUT dysfunction ± functional outlet issue rather than true chronic retention/overflow (no palpable bladder, young, otherwise well) but incomplete emptying sensation + dribbling so need PVR.  
– UTI, DM, acute obstruction, overt neuro cause unlikely on current hx/ex + last week’s urine. Still need to exclude diabetes/renal.  
– Psych overlay: embarrassed, but not overt anxiety/depression today.  

Plan 09:25  
Investigations:  
- Path (S&N): FBE, U&E/eGFR, fasting BSL, HbA1c, TSH.  
- Urine M/C/S (despite negative dipstick) – rule out occult UTI.  
- Renal tract + bladder USS incl post‑void residual (bulk‑billed if possible).  
- Will consider uroflowmetry / cystoscopy depending on urology.  

Mx (kept simple today – time short):  
- Reassured serious neuro disease unlikely given isolated urinary Sx + normal screen neuro, but agreed to full work‑up.  
- Asked to cut back caffeine esp arvo/evening (aim last coffee before ~1500), keep fluids ~1.5–2 L/day, avoid extreme restriction, keep voiding before bed.  
- No meds started (avoid anticholinergic / mirabegron / desmopressin until know PVR + imaging).  

Referral:  
- Public urology referral sent (HealthLink) – non‑urgent but requested sooner if possible. Query: nocturnal enuresis vs detrusor underactivity vs outlet obstruction/urethral stricture/other LUT dysfunction in young male. Asked for uroflow + formal PVR, and advice re further mgmt (± cystoscopy).  

Safety net:  
- Told to go to ED if can’t pass urine, severe suprapubic pain, visible blood in urine, fevers/rigors, or new neuro Sx (leg weakness, numbness, saddle anaesthesia).  

Follow‑up:  
- Review here 2–3/52 with bloods, urine, USS results (or earlier if worse).  
- Can book separate appt if wants to talk more about impact on sleep/relationships/exam stress.  

11:40 – quick phone msg left (no answer) to remind fasting bloods before 10am for BSL/HbA1c.
