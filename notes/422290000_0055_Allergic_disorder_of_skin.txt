29F teacher – f/up. Multiple issues “while I’m here” → limited to nose + hands today. Asked to book long appt for rest (fatigue, shoulder, mole, feet, contraception etc).  

CC: sneezing / blocked nose  
3–4/52 hx sneezing, nasal blockage, clear rhinorrhoea, itchy nose/eyes. Worse AM + at school. No fever, no facial pain, no purulent d/c, no cough/SOB/wheeze. Using cetirizine 10 mg PRN w partial relief. Sleep mildly affected.  

Exam (ENT quick): well, no distress. Nasal mucosa pale/boggy, clear d/c. Mild conjunctival injection. Chest clear.  

Dx: allergic rhinitis, likely env/occupational triggers (classroom dust/cleaners). No red flag sinusitis.  

Plan  
- Start fluticasone prop 50 mcg/spray IN: 2 sprays each nostril mane x 1–2/52 then ↓ to 1 spray each nostril mane for maint as tolerated (PBS).  
- Continue cetirizine 10 mg PO PRN, can use daily during flares.  
- Saline spray PRN before steroid if needed.  
- Try ↓ exposure to classroom sprays / improve ventilation.  
- RTC if unilateral blockage, facial pain, purulent d/c > ~1/52, fever, SOB/wheeze.  

Skin – hands  
Known allergic/irritant dermatitis (no patch testing done). Flare x 1–2/52 since cleaning roster change at school, worse w wipes/sprays, better weekends. Using sorbolene intermittently, no steroid currently. No systemic sx.  

Exam hands: erythematous dry scaly plaques dorsum + interdigital, mild lichenification, excoriations. No vesicles, no crusting, no pustules, no spreading erythema.  

Dx: allergic contact / atopic-type hand dermatitis, occupationally aggravated, mild–mod, no e/o infection.  

Plan  
- Methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream OD to affected areas hands only x up to 7/7 then PRN for flares. Avoid face/eyelids.  
- Regular emollient (QV/Dermeze etc) multiple times/day incl after handwashing, continue long term.  
- Advise minimise wet work/harsh cleaners where poss, use cotton-lined nitrile gloves for cleaning.  
- If recurrent / poor response over 4–6/52 → consider derm referral for patch testing.  
- Red flags for infection discussed – RTC if ↑pain, warmth, weep, pustules, fever.  

Other issues (not addressed today due to time): fatigue, R shoulder pain, mole on back, plantar foot pain, contraception review, bloating. Pt advised long appt 20–30 mins in next 2–3/52 to go through list.  

Ix: nil today. Will consider bloods (FBC, TFT, Vit D, coeliac) at fatigue review if still an issue.  

F/up:  
- Review 3–4/52 re rhinitis control + hand dermatitis response.  
- Book separate long appt for remaining concerns.
