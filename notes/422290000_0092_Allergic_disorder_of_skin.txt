Follow up – booked re “skin allergy” but main thing today actually headache  

32F, works in childcare. Limited English – daughter here translating, does most of the talking. Pt keeps saying “sorry, no understand, my daughter talk”.  

Headache  
- “Bad headache, 3 days…here and here” – points to forehead/temples both sides  
- Gradual onset, not thunderclap. More of a “pressure, like someone pushing”  
- Constant dull ache, sometimes throbbing later in the day, esp after work with noisy kids / screens.  
- Wakes either no headache or mild, then builds over the day.  
- Severity up to 6/10, 3/10 now.  
- No nausea, no vomiting, no visual changes, no aura, no weakness, no speech or swallowing issues, no dizziness, no fever, no neck stiffness.  
- Not pregnant. No recent head injury. No “worst in my life” story.  
- Taking paracetamol 1 g up to TDS herself, and ibuprofen 400 mg once yesterday – helped “a bit”.  
- Thinks maybe “too much phone, too much looking” or “maybe the cream for my face make my head sore”. Explained unlikely related to mild topical steroid/emollient.  
- Daughter says mum has been “coming home wrecked from work, not drinking much water, just goes straight to bed with the lights off”.  

PMHx relevant  
- Chronic atopic/irritant dermatitis, pityriasis alba. Childhood eczema. No known migraines, no HTN, DM etc.  
- No reg meds apart from topical steroids + moisturiser, PRN paracetamol. NKDA.  

Exam (focused)  
- Looks well, chatting with daughter, no distress.  
- Obs today: BP 112/70, HR 74, afebrile, sats 99% RA.  
- Neuro: CN grossly intact, normal gait, moving all limbs 5/5, sensation/coordination normal. Neck supple, no meningism.  
- Head/eyes: no scalp or temporal tenderness, no sinus tenderness. No visual complaints.  

Skin – quick look as review  
- Hands: mild erythema/dryness dorsum + between fingers, no fissuring, no ooze, no crusts.  
- Face: faint hypopigmented, slightly scaly patches on cheeks – looks like pityriasis alba, not inflamed. No infection.  

IMP  
1) Tension-type headache vs mild migraine without aura – 3 days, non-focal exam, no red flags. Likely multifactorial (noise/stress at childcare, possible eye strain, hydration). No features to suggest ICH/meningitis/temporal arteritis etc today.  
2) Chronic dermatitis (atopic + irritant) with pityriasis alba – mild hand flare only, face stable. Occupational irritant exposure ongoing.  
3) CALD, limited English – ↑ risk of misunderstanding treatment plan. Daughter translating; offered interpreter for future.  

PLAN  
Headache  
- Reassured – no red flag features currently. Discussed red flag symptoms and to seek urgent care if sudden severe “worst ever” headache, fever/neck stiffness, confusion, weakness, visual change, difficulty speaking, vomiting, or if much worse.  
- Analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol 1 g up to QID PRN (max 4 g/24 h).  
  - May use ibuprofen 400 mg up to TDS PRN with food short term if tolerates, avoid if any GI upset/pregnancy.  
- Non-drug: encouraged fluids, short breaks from screens/noise where possible, simple neck/shoulder stretches. No imaging/bloods today – review if persists or pattern changes.  

Skin  
- Continue emollient frequently (esp after hand-washing). Suggested large pump pack, cheap fragrance-free sorbolene-type.  
- Hands: continue moderate potency steroid (mometasone 0.1% cream) OD to red/itchy areas only for up to 7 days then stop; otherwise moisturiser only. Avoid continuous daily steroid.  
- Face: hydrocortisone 1% thin layer OD up to 7 days only when red/itchy; otherwise moisturiser + gentle non-soap cleanser. Sun protection discussed briefly.  
- No antibiotics indicated – no signs of infection.  
- If ongoing frequent flares despite this, consider derm referral for patch testing (gloves/cleaners etc).  

Communication  
- Wrote very simple instructions (headache tablets, “red cream” vs “white cream”) for pt to take home; used diagrams.  
- Checked understanding by asking pt to show where to put which cream; initially wanted to put steroid over whole hands daily – corrected.  
- Suggested professional interpreter for longer/complex future appts; daughter agreeable if needed.  

Other  
- Pt mentioned “very tired all the time” right at end – no time to explore today. Asked to book longer appt for fatigue workup (bloods etc).  

F/U: 2 weeks with GP, earlier if headache persisting beyond ~1–2 weeks, worsening or changing character, or if skin flare not settling after 7–10 days / any signs of infection.
