34F R ear pain  

Came in mainly for R earache x ~3 days. Says started as “just a niggle” now “a dull ache with the odd sharp jab”, worse lying on that side and when chewing. No obvious injury. Had a bit of a head cold last week, “kids at school all snotty again”, nose blocked then, now mostly better.  

Denies discharge, fevers, vertigo, sig hearing loss. Feels “a bit run down, just tired from work”. Thinks maybe “I’ve caught something in my ear” or new shampoo “might be irritating the skin around my ear”. Has known “allergic dermatitis/eczema” around ears/neck. Admits not using creams regularly – “I keep forgetting, ran out a few weeks ago”.  

Paracetamol PRN with partial relief. No recent swimming, flights, or cotton buds deep in canal, but has been “having a bit of a scratch” at canal entrance.  

Background: allergic/atopic-type dermatitis mainly peri-auricular/neck, flexures. On/off hydrocortisone 1% and sorbolene previously. No regular meds currently. NKDA recorded, but sensitive to fragrances. Non-smoker.  

Exam (focused):  
Obs today: BP 118/72, HR 82, afebrile, sats 99% RA. Looks well, comfortable.  
R ear: dry, erythematous, scaly skin behind ear, some excoriations. Mild tenderness with pinna movement but not severe. Canal lateral third a bit red, slightly scaly, no swelling, no debris, no discharge. TM intact, pearly, no bulge/retraction. No mastoid tenderness or swelling.  
L ear normal. Mild nasal congestion only. No cervical nodes.  

Skin (brief): peri-auricular and lateral neck with erythematous, dry, lichenified patches, no obvious secondary infection, no vesicles/pustules.  

Impression:  
- R ear pain – likely referred from peri-auricular dermatitis with mild early otitis externa from scratching. TM normal, no AOM, no mastoiditis. Recent URTI may be contributing a bit but not main issue.  
- Chronic allergic/atopic-type dermatitis (peri-auricular/neck) – mild flare, poor adherence to emollient and steroid. No clear evidence of bacterial or HSV superinfection today.  

Plan:  
Ear / dermatitis  
- Explained likely skin-driven ear pain rather than middle ear infection.  
- Topical: mometasone furoate 0.1% cream OD x 5–7 days very sparingly to outer canal entrance + peri-auricular skin (avoid deeper canal).  
- Restart emollient: sorbolene/paraffin cream BD–QID to affected areas ongoing (script + repeats).  
- For flare elsewhere (face/neck): hydrocortisone 1% thin layer OD up to 5–7 days then stop, continue emollient only.  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day). Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food if needed and no issues.  

Avoid / triggers  
- Asked to stop new shampoo and fragranced products around ears/neck for now; use fragrance-free sensitive products.  
- Asked to bring photos/list of products next visit.  

Adherence  
- Pt acknowledges “I’m hopeless with remembering the creams”. Suggested phone reminders and keeping cream by toothbrush. Gave simple written plan on summary.  
- Scripts with repeats to reduce running out.  

Ix: none today – clinically mild dermatitis/otitis externa, TM normal. If recurrent/persistent, consider swab and derm referral.  

Safety net:  
- RTC/ED if ↑pain, fevers, discharge, hearing loss, spreading redness/swelling esp behind ear, vertigo, severe headache.  

Follow-up:  
- Review 1–2 weeks to check ear pain and skin control (book longer appt if wants full dermatitis work-up/possible derm referral).
