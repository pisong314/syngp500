2) AMD bilat – stable per ophthal, sig fx on mood  

Plan  
– Discussed link chronic sensory loss ↔ mood  
– Pt prefers non-pharm first →  
   • Refer psych under Better Access (CBT / adjustment to vision loss, older adult focus if poss)  
   • Info re Vision Australia / low vision rehab + social groups (gave printout large font)  
– Discussed SSRI (sertraline) option; pt wants to hold off for now, will reconsider if no better  
– Reassured AREDS supp unlikely cause of low mood → continue as per ophthal  
– Sleep / circadian: advised ↑daylight exposure, reg sleep/wake, avoid long day naps (re her keeping blinds down)  
– Ophthal f/up: cont injections + routine review, no red flags today (no distortion, flashes, floaters, curtain, pain)  

Ix ordered today (on site)  
– FBC  
– U&E, LFT  
– TSH  
– B12, folate  
– Fasting BSL, lipids (age/opportunistic)  

Other  
– Asked about aspirin for prevention → deferred to separate appt (time)  
– Safety-net: RTC earlier / OOH GP / ED if mood markedly worse or SI  

F/up  
– Review 3–4/52 for mood + bloods, reconsider ADs  
– Longer consult later for CVD prevention / geriatric review once mood addressed  

Billing: Level C, bulk billed
