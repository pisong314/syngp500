# Reason for visit  
"feeling really weak and tired" x ~5/7  
recent vomiting  

# HPI / Functional focus  
Office admin works FT desk based  
Over last 5/7 ↓energy feeling "wiped out" struggles to get through workday  
Reports 3/7 vomiting prior now largely settled  

Vomiting  
- Onset 5/7 nausea then vom 4/7 peaked over 2/7 now last vom yesterday am  
- 5–6x/day at worst food then bile  
- Assoc ↓oral intake ↓appetite mild crampy epigastric pain only during vom now resolved  
- Loose stool 1–2x/day during worst now back to usual  
- Nil haematemesis melena PR bleed nil recent travel nil sick contacts  
- Nil ETOH excess nil rec drugs nil cannabis  

Functional impact  
- Feels drained shaky esp on standing  
- Light headed on fast sit→stand  
- Mobility independent gait normal pace able to transfer on/off plinth unaided  
- Able to complete basic ADLs at home slower than usual needs rests  
- Work: remains at work but ↓productivity fatigues by mid arvo  

IIH hx  
- Known idiopathic intracranial HTN dx ~18/12 on acetazolamide 250mg BD  
- Baseline intermittent frontal HA  
- Today mild frontal HA similar to usual  
- Brief visual "fuzziness" on standing only nil persistent visual loss nil diplopia  
- Nil focal neuro sx  
- Pt adamant current sx "not from my head problem"  

Other  
- Nil fevers rigors night sweats  
- Menses regular LMP ~2/52 s/p tubal ligation says zero chance preg declined β‑hCG after discussion  
- Meds  
  - Acetazolamide 250mg BD  
  - Paracetamol up to 3g/day last few days  
  - Occ ibuprofen not in last wk  
- Allergies NKDA  
- Social lives with partner nonsmoker minimal ETOH stressed re sick leave  

Behaviour  
Pt quite argumentative frequently interrupts quotes internet eg "its probably my thyroid" "docs just say virus and send you home"  
Required some boundary setting to keep consult on track  

# Examination  
Gen alert orientated looks tired not toxic nil active vom slightly irritable  
Vitals BP 104/68 HR 96 RR 16 SpO₂ 99% RA Temp 36.9  
Postural BP 98/64 HR 108 mild dizziness on standing borderline orthostatic  
Mucous membranes slightly dry  
Neuro GCS 15 CN grossly intact PERRL VF grossly full power 5/5 all limbs tone/reflexes WNL gait normal  
Fundoscopy limited view no obvious papilloedema though not definitive  
CVS HS dual nil murmur  
Resp clear  
Abdo soft NT ND BS normal nil mass  
Skin nil rash  

Functionally safe to mobilise in room independent turns sit↔stand mildly symptomatic on fast stand improves with pause  

# Assessment  
1 Weakness fatigue 2° recent gastro like illness with mild dehydration  
   - Likely self limiting viral or foodborne gastro now improving  
   - Haemodynamically stable borderline postural changes mild ↓oral intake  

2 Vomiting now settling  
   - Risk of electrolyte disturbance given several days poor intake + acetazolamide  

3 Known idiopathic intracranial HTN  
   - Today nil features of acute raised ICP flare  
   - Recent vom could be contributing but pattern more c/w GI  
   - Need to monitor vision HA pattern  

Pt strongly focussed on "thyroid" and "vitamins" requested injections and imaging declined today not clinically indicated  

# Plan / Management  

## Symptom + functional management  
- Encouraged graded oral rehydration small freq sips Hydralyte etc aim to maintain urine output and support return to usual ADLs  
- Light bland diet as tolerated  
- Avoid NSAIDs next few days may use paracetamol up to 4g/24h short term for HA  

Meds  
- New: Ondansetron ODT 4mg 1 tab up to TDS PRN N/V max 3/day for 2/7 only PBS  
  - Warned re constipation HA stop once settled  

No change to acetazolamide dose today  

## Investigations (pathology today)  
- FBC  
- UEC CMP incl LFTs  
- CRP  
- Random BSL  
- TSH iron studies B12 folate added given pt concern re thyroid/iron though explained less likely in acute 5/7 hx  

Explained if sig electrolyte abn or renal issues → ED for IV fluids further mx  
Pt queried "why waste money on tests when I just need vitamins" rationale discussed eventually agreed  

## Neuro / ICP safety net  
Reassured nil current red flags on exam  
Clear advice ED/000 if  
- sudden severe "worst ever" HA  
- persistent or ↑vom esp early am  
- new or worsening visual change blurred diplopia visual loss  
- confusion speech difficulty limb weakness seizure  

Advised contact neurologist or ED if any concern re IIH flare pt a bit dismissive but verbalised understanding when asked to repeat key points  

## Functional rehab focus  
- Short term goal 3–5/7  
  - maintain safe independent mobility with minimal postural sx  
  - tolerate adequate oral fluids + light meals without vom  
  - able to complete basic ADLs without near syncope  
- Medium term goal 2–3/52  
  - return to baseline work tolerance full office day without sig fatigue  
  - if fatigue persists beyond resolution of gastro consider graded activity program reconditioning and further workup  

Education  
- Explained link between dehydration electrolytes and ↓energy postural sx  
- Normalised temporary ↓exercise tolerance encouraged pacing breaks esp from sit→stand tasks  
- Briefly addressed internet info re thyroid clarified that acute 5/7 onset with clear GI trigger less typical for thyroid dysfunction though screening ordered  

Pt remained somewhat dissatisfied "youre doing the bare minimum" declined IV fluids "dont need a drip"  

# Billing  
Standard consult 23  
Bulk billed  

# Follow up  
- GP r/v 2–3/7 or earlier if ongoing vom unable to keep fluids down worsening dizziness ↓urine output confusion  
- Longer appt 1–2/52 if fatigue ongoing once bloods back for more detailed fatigue + IIH mgmt incl possible graded activity plan work accomodations  

[Addendum 16:30 same day – Dr L Tan]  
Path results not yet available will check tomorrow if abn will call pt for earlier r/v otherwise discuss @ planned f/u
