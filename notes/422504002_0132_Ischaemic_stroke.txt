L sided weakness  

HPI  
76yo male Anglo Aus retired electrician new to clinic walk in  
Poor historian abit vague re timing + meds  
Says woke this morning and L arm "not working right" then later "mightve been a few days maybe last week"  
Unable to give clear LSW time  
Noted dragging L leg when up to toilet today time unknown  
Neighbour brought him in thought "face looked a bit funny" speech earlier "slurry" per neighbour  

Current sx  
L arm weak dropping objects ↓ grip cant lift above shoulder  
L leg weak wobbly holds furniture  
Mild slurred speech earlier now mostly settled per pt  
Nil HA CP SOB palps  
Nil visual loss diplopia  
Nil head trauma nil seizure  

Past Hx  (pt reliability limited)  
AF "heart a bit jumpy" duration ?  
T2DM  
Likely HTN  
Prev hospitalisation "for my heart" details unclear  
?Prev stroke TIA pt unsure  

Meds  
Pt unsure names doses  
"little white pill for the heart or blue one"  
"tablet for sugar" "tablet for pressure"  
Thinks used to be on warfarin → maybe changed to a NOAC "the dear one"  
Unclear if currently anticoagulated  
No clear antiplatelet hx  

Allergies  
NKDA (pt not certain)

CVS

Resp  
Chest clear AE good  

Neuro (focused)  
Speech mild dysarthria comprehension intact  
CN: mild L lower facial droop forehead sparing EOMI pupils equal reactive VF grossly intact to confrontation tongue midline  
Motor  
R side 5/5  
L UL 3/5 prox distal ↓ grip drift present  
L LL 4/5 mild drift  
Tone ↑ L UL cf R  
Reflexes brisk L vs R plantars L equivocal R downgoing  
Sensory L side "bit dull" responses inconsistent  
Gait not fully tested when stood w assist clear L leg drag unsafe to continue  
Nil meningism  

POC  
BGL 8.7 mmol/L  
ECG AF VR ~85 no acute ST-T chg  

Impression  
Acute focal neuro deficit L hemiparesis facial droop dysarthria in 76yo M w AF T2DM HTN  
High suspicion R MCA territory ischaemic stroke ?cardioembolic vs large vessel disease  
Onset time unclear poss wake up stroke poss >4.5h → thrombolysis eligibility uncertain needs ED stroke team  
Stroke mimics less likely given clear focal signs BGL ok nil seizure  

Dx  
1 Suspected acute ischaemic stroke R carotid/MCA distribution  
2 AF rate controlled anticoag status unknown  
3 T2DM  
4 HTN  

Plan  
This is an emergency explained to pt neighbour in plain language that sx most likely stroke on R side of brain risk of permanent disability death if delay  

1 Transfer  
000 called urgent ambulance to regional referral hospital ED stroke capable  
Verbal handover to paramedics re  
- L hemiparesis facial droop dysarthria  
- AF T2DM HTN  
- Uncertain LSW time  
- Unknown anticoag meds  
Printed brief summary sent with pt  

2 ED / hospital requests  
- Urgent CT brain ± CTA to exclude haemorrhage assess LVO  
- Clarify LSW via wife neighbour  
- Assess for IV thrombolysis and/or EVT as per stroke protocol  
- Start aspirin once ICH excluded if not on anticoag or unless contraindicated  
- Admit to stroke unit for monitoring BP control swallow screen rehab etc  

3 Chronic / secondary prevention issues flagged for later  
- AF confirm current anticoag if nil then likely start DOAC for stroke prevention post acute phase as per guidelines  
- T2DM check HbA1c adjust meds dietitian etc  
- BP long term target <130/80 likely need regular ACEi/ARB ± other  
- Lipids start high intensity statin eg atorvastatin 40–80mg nocte PBS  
- Smoking status clarify offer cessation support  

Med changes today  
Nil commenced in clinic given suspected acute stroke and pending imaging  
No aspirin given here as anticoag status unknown and onset unclear  

Counselling  
Pt initially wanted to go home "have a lie down" and see usual GP later strongly advised against given time critical nature after discussion pt agreed to ambulance transfer  
Neighbour contacted wife from rooms advised to meet him in ED  

Safety net  
ED to manage acutely  
Advised pt to return to GP after hospital discharge for ongoing care  

Follow up  
GP f/u r/v 1–2/52 post discharge with discharge summary for  
- stroke secondary prevention plan antiplatelet/anticoag statin BP  
- AF + DM management  
- functional status rehab needs driving clearance etc
