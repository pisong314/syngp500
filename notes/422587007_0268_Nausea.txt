72F known pt CKD4, GORD, functional dyspepsia  

CC: “severe vomiting”  

HPI  
- Long hx intermittent N/V re dyspepsia/CKD  
- Last 48h: ~6–7x vomits/day, non-bloody, non-bilious, now only sips H2O tolerated, no solids since yesterday am  
- Nausea constant, early satiety, usual upper abdo discomfort only, no colicky/acute pain  
- ↑ postural sx: light‑headed, “wobbly” to bathroom  
- ↓ UO, darker urine  
- -ve red flags by phone: no CP, SOB, neuro sx, fever, diarrhoea, haematemesis, melaena, abdo distension, still passing flatus/BM y/day  

Pregnancy  
- Not pregnant, post‑menopausal decades. Using pregnancy guideline language as severity marker only  

Meds (relevant)  
- Esomeprazole 40 mg mane (↑ dose 2/52 ago)  
- Metoclopramide 10 mg PRN – has NOT used this episode  
- Gaviscon PRN  
- CKD: perindopril, frusemide, phosphate binder, Vit D. No NSAIDs/SGLT2i. NKDA  
- Paracetamol 1g TDS last wk  

O/E (phone)  
- Home BP 100/64 (baseline ~130/75), HR ~96 (pt count) → likely volume depletion  
- Voice weak, dry, talking full sentences, no audible SOB, feels dry mouth, tired, “clammy earlier”  

A  
1) Acute severe N/V on background chronic functional dyspepsia/GORD + CKD4 → likely multifactorial, now dehydrated, ?AKI risk  
2) CKD4 – high risk pre‑renal AKI with ↓ intake/vomiting  
3) GORD/functional dyspepsia – probable contribution  
4) Anxiety around severe causes (pre‑eclampsia/AFLP) – misapplied but reflects high health literacy  

DDx (brief)  
- Most likely: flare of chronic dyspepsia/GORD + CKD‑related ↓ clearance ± mild viral/dietary trigger  
- Also: early infective gastro, peptic flare  
- Need to exclude in ED: obstruction, ACS atypical, ICH, significant uraemia/AKI  

Plan  
- Not suitable for community/telehealth mgt given age + CKD4 + freq vomits + ↓BP  
→ Strongly advised URGENT ED review today  
  • IV fluids  
  • Bloods: UEC/eGFR, LFTs, FBC, CRP, lipase, VBG if avail, urinalysis  
  • ECG (age, antiemetic QT issues)  
  • IV antiemetic (likely ondansetron, renal dosing, QT check)  
  • Consider abdo imaging if exam suggests obstruction/other  

- Pre‑ED advice:  
  • NO metoclopramide or other dopamine antags before review  
  • Small frequent sips H2O/ORS only  
  • Skip tonight’s frusemide dose pending ED review (↓ further volume loss)  
  • Cont perindopril for now – ED may hold if Cr ↑  

- Safety net: if collapse/near syncope, severe CP/SOB, sudden severe headache/confusion → call 000 not drive  

Carer input  
- Husband present, able to drive to ED, agrees she “looks more washed out than usual”  

Handover  
- Will send brief e‑referral to local ED: hx CKD4, acute N/V 48h, ↓BP, ?dehydration/AKI risk, med list + request above ix  

F/U  
- GP review 3–5d post‑ED or post‑discharge for chronic N/V/CKD med review, poss GI referral  

Telehealth  
- Tel consult ~14 mins  
- ID confirmed DOB/address  
- Pt at home (rural), travel to ED by private car feasible
