Plan:  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (adv to use regularly next few days)  
  • Naproxen 500 mg BD with food 5–7/7 then PRN (avoid other NSAIDs, GI/renal cautions)  
  Pt reluctant but agrees short trial. Declined neuropathic agents

– Non-pharm brief: gentle neck ROM, avoid prolonged flexion, heat pack PRN

– Ix: needs MRI C-spine (non-urgent but soon) – cannot order Medicare MRI from AH clinic → advised see usual GP within 5–7/7 for MRI request + ongoing mgmt. Written summary sent with pt

– Physio discussed (posture, strengthening, nerve glides). Pt “see how it goes first” – defer to usual GP

Red flags explained: ↑weakness, new leg sx/gait/balance issues, hand clumsiness, saddle numb, bladder/bowel change, severe ↑pain esp w fever → ED ASAP, don’t wait for GP

F/up: with usual GP 5–7/7 for MRI, review analgesia, consider neuropathic meds / specialist if persisting. RTC/ED earlier if deterioration

(Chronic low back “stiff for years” mentioned – not addressed today, needs std hrs review)
