C/O: ↑R arm numb/tingling 10–14/7. Known C-spine disc dz + early cervical myelopathy under NSx [public hosp].  

HPC  
R arm “pins/needles / cotton wool” C6 pattern → lat upper arm/forearm → thumb + index. Initially intermittent now most of day. Worse neck extn + comp work. Pain not major, mainly paraesthesia + feels weaker opening jars but no actual loss of fxn.  
Known C5/6, C6/7 disc dz w radiculopathy + early myelopathy on MRI mid 2024. NSx review 4/12 ago: mild gait change only, conservative mx, poss decompression if prog.  
Last 2–3/52: slight ↑ unsteady on uneven ground, no falls. Mild ↑ difficulty w buttons but managing. No bowel/bladder sx, no saddle anaesthesia, no trauma.  
No red flag systemic sx. No facial/visual/speech sx.  

Meds: PCM up to 3g/d, ibuprofen 400 bd prn, atorva 20 nocte. NKDA.  
SHx: office job, lots of computer. Non-smoker.  

O/E  
Obs stable AF, BP132/78. Well, anxious.  
Neck: ↓ROM extn + R rot; extn + R lat flexn reproduces R arm sx.  
Neuro (targeted):  
- Gait: slightly cautious, narrow base, can tandem but a bit wobbly (similar to prev per notes)  
- Power UL: R elbow flex 4+/5, wrist ext 4+/5, rest 5/5. L 5/5. LL not grossly changed.  
- Reflexes: brisk biceps R (3+), knees 3+ bilat, others ~unchanged. Hoffman R equivocal (same as old). Plantars flexor.  
- Sensation: ↓LT + pin over R lat forearm + thumb/index (C6). LL sensation intact.  
No clonus. No saddle anaesthesia.  
Compared to last GP exam 4/12 ago: myelopathic signs essentially stable; new clearer R C6 sensory loss + slight ↓ power R elbow/wrist only.  

A  
1) Cervical disc dz C5/6, C6/7 with R C6 radiculopathy – flare, likely posture/desk related. Mild new myotomal weakness but no rapid stepwise deterioration, no bowel/bladder, no major new gait disturbance.  
2) Known early cervical myelopathy – clinically similar baseline but pt reports slight ↑ unsteadiness → needs repeat imaging + earlier NSx review given risk of prog.  
3) HTN (diet controlled), hyperlipidaemia – not focus today.  

P  
Ix  
- MRI C-spine w contrast – semi-urgent (1–2/52). If delay >2/52 + sx prog → consider ED/NSx on-call.  

Meds  
- PCM ok up to 4g/d max (reminded).  
- Start naproxen 250mg bd with food x5–7/7 then prn if helping. Avoid other NSAIDs. Discussed GI/renal risk.  
- Neuropathic agents (gabapentin/pregabalin/amitriptyline) discussed briefly – hold off for now as pain mild, mainly sensory change; review post MRI/NSx.  

Non-pharm  
- Continue physio/neck stabilisation. Avoid cervical traction/manipulation given myelopathy.  
- Brief chat re ergonomics / ↓neck extn.  

Referrals  
- Letter to existing NSx at [major public hosp] – summary of new R C6 sx, exam, request review 2–4/52 or sooner if MRI worse.  
- Will msg physio after MRI with update.  

Safety net  
- ED/same-day review if: new/worse limb weakness, new major gait change/falls, bowel/bladder incontinence/retention, saddle numbness, marked hand clumsiness. RTC if any rapid change.  

Other  
- Pt keen on data re surg vs conservative in mild myelopathy – deferred detailed discussion, plan longer appt after MRI.  
- Asked to book separate CDM review (BP/lipids) in 4–6/52.  

F/U  
- Review 1–2/52 with MRI result or earlier if deterioration. Will call if MRI shows significant prog → may direct to ED.  

Billing: Level C, private billing – gap $45. Bulk bill MRI request (standard).
