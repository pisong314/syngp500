- painful mouth ulcer x ~5d  

HPC  
Smoking  
- 50+ yr smoker, now ~8–10 cig/d (mostly offsite w family / carpark)  
- demanding varenicline (not available)  
- refuses “patches/lozenges” initially, hostile, then agrees to trial if framed as “strong”  
- no ↑cough, no SOB, no CP, no recent LRTI  

Mouth ulcer  
- single painful oral ulcer 5d, ↓oral intake  
- similar to prev Behçet flares, no genital/eye sx, no systemic sx

Allergies: NKDA  

Exam (targeted)  
Obs today: BP 138/76 HR 82 RR 16 SpO₂ 97% RA afeb  
Oral: single 4–5mm shallow ulcer L buccal mucosa, grey base, ery halo, very TTP, no induration, no suspicious features, no other ulcers  
Chest clear, CVS N, no nodes  

Impression  
1) Behçet-related oral aphthous ulcer – minor, no red flags, no sec infection clinically  
2) Nicotine dependence – long-term, partially motivated, wants pharmacotherapy, varenicline not option → NRT trial  
3) Behçet’s on colchicine + low-dose pred – stable otherwise  
4) Cyclic neutropenia – ↑risk oral infection but currently stable  
5) Fatigue / ?nutritional / ?anaemia – to review separately (time)  

Plan  
Mouth ulcer  
- Continue saline mouth rinses  
- Start triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% dental paste – apply to ulcer TDS after meals, NBM 30min post  
- Start benzydamine 1% oral gel PRN 2–3 hourly for pain (PBS script, RACF to stock)  
- Paracetamol PRN already charted – ask RN to offer pre-meals while ulcer painful  
- RN to monitor size/pain; if not improving or worse at 10–14d or >2–3w total → re‑review, FBE, CRP, B12/folate/iron/zinc ± oral med/dentist for biopsy if atypical  

Smoking  
- Explained varenicline supply issues + risk profile given age/comorbidities  
- No obvious CI to bupropion but will defer (age, polypharmacy, behavioural issues) → start with combo NRT  
- New: nicotine patch 21mg/24h OD (PBS)  
- New: nicotine lozenges 2mg PRN cravings, max 15/day  
- Instructions to RN: apply patch daily upper arm/torso, rotate sites, observe for rash; supervise lozenge use; document cig use when offsite if possible  
- Plan “cut down to quit” over next 4/52 – aim ~50% reduction then review  
- Pt aware meds assist but not guarantee; somewhat reluctant but consented  

Behçet / neutropenia  
- No change to colchicine or pred today  
- RN to watch for fever, spreading oral lesions, ↑pain, swelling, malodour → urgent GP review, FBE  

Ix  
- None today (time, stable)  
- Next longer appt (1–2/52) for fatigue/nutrition workup  
  - FBE (incl neutrophils)  
  - Iron studies, B12, folate, ± zinc  
  - U&E, LFTs, TFTs  

RACF comms  
- Verbal handover to RN: new scripts/orders for triamcinolone paste, benzydamine gel, nicotine patch + lozenges; monitor oral intake, ulcer, smoking pattern; call if ulcer not settling 10–14d or systemic sx  

F/up  
- Review 1/52 on next RACF round – ulcer + NRT use / cig count  
- Book separate 20–30min review 2–3/52 for fatigue + bloods – suggest daughter/EPOA join by phone  

Safety net (brief)  
- Adv pt/RN: seek urgent review if ↑mouth pain, multiple new ulcers, dysphagia, breathing issues, bleeding, neck lumps, or fever/rigors  

Billing  
- RACF visit, bulk billed (item 731 equivalent RACF attendance – time >20min)
