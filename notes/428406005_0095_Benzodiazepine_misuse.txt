Telehelath (phone) – new pt

Reason:  
Pt requesting completion of Centrelink / housing medical forms re mental helath + meds.

HPI:  
32 yr old male, casual warehosue work. New to clinic, no records on file yet.  
Long h/o benzo use – initially diazepam for anx + sleep “few years back”, now using daily, both prescrptions and from freinds. Est ~20–30mg diazepam equiv most days for last 12–18 mths. Uses to “switch my brain off” / for sleep.  
Reports withdrawal sx when without: very edgy, can’t sleep, feels sick + sweaty. No prev seizures.  
Denies ETOH dependance (social 1–2x/wk, 3–4 drinks), no other current illicit drugs (past occas cannabis).  

Psych hx (self report):  
- Psychosis – hx voices + paranoia, prev seen by community MH, thinks was on olanzapine, stopped ~6 mths ago due to wt gain + sedation. No current antipsychotic. Voices “come and go but not too bad now”.  
- Personality disorder dx in past (type unclear).  
- Chronic insomnia for yrs, worse when trying to cut down benzos.  

Funciton: casual work, misses shifts due to poor sleep / “benzo hangover”. Lives alone, on Centrelink, housing insecure (forms for this).

Risk:  
No current SI/HI. Voices background only. No heavy ETOH, no IV use. No h/o w/drawal seizures.  
Telehealth only – no obs or exam. Couldn’t access My Health Record / RTPM during call (system lag, will check later).

Forms:  
Explained need for longer review + access to old records before I can complete Centrelink/housing forms properly. Pt agreeable to longer appt, prefers F2F.

Exam:  
Not possible – phone only.

Impression:  
1. Benzodiazepine use disorder – likely mod–severe, long term high dose, w/drawal sx.  
2. Psychosis – chronic, partially symptomatic by hx, off antipsychotics 6+ mths.  
3. Personality disorder (unspecified).  
4. Chronic insomnia.  
5. Psychosocial stressors incl unstable housing.

Medications today:  
No benzo script issued – discussed I will *not* provide ongoing high dose benzos or replace non‑prescribed use.  
No other med changes – needs full review first.  
Plan future: consider conversion to diazepam with slow taper once dose clarified + RTPM checked, poss staged supply via single pharmacy (PBS).

Plan:  
- Declined to start/continue benzos today pending F2F assess + RTPM (SafeScript/ScriptCheck) review.  
- Arrange long F2F within 1 wk for:  
  - Full MH + substance use review  
  - Vitals, exam  
  - Consider diazepam stabilisation + gradual taper plan  
  - Start Centrelink/housing forms (may need further visit once collateral info obtained).  
- At next visit: consider baseline bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, BSL/HbA1c, TFTs, +/- UDS).  
- Discussed need to re‑engage with MH services – plan referral to local community MH team / public psych for psychosis + PD + med review.  
- Also discuss AOD service referral next appt for benzo support (eg local drug + alcohol clinic).  

Safety:  
Advised attend ED / call 000 if severe w/drawal, seizures, marked ↑ hallucinations/paranoia, or SI/HI. Otherwise RTC/urgent appt if deteriorates.

Follow up:  
Book long F2F appt <1 wk.  
Will obtain consent next visit to request records from prev GP + MH services.

Time: ~14 mins phone consult.

[Addendum 11:27 – brief RTPM check once system back: multiple diazepam scripts from different GPs over past yr, details to review properly at F2F – JB]
