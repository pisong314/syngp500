Pt: 27yo F, primary school teacher, known to clinic.  

Reason for visit:  
F/up L knee pain – “when you push my kneecap sideways it really hurts, I want an MRI and proper scans this time”.  

HPI:  
Ongiong L ant knee pain ~3 mths. Seen ~4 wks ago, dx patello–femoral pain. Given info + home ex’s – only did for about a week, “too busy and they didn’t work straight away”.  
Pain dull ache behind/around patella, worse stairs (esp down), squatting, kneeling with kids, sitting cross‑legged. No locking, no true giving way, no big swellling. Localises “right behind the kneecap”.  

Very focussed on patella movment – “if you press it sideways it’s agony, my friend had that and they did an MRI straight away… why can’t you just order the MRI I’m asking for?”. Wants MRI + ortho ref today, wants it “fixed before next term”.  

OTC ibuprofen on/off, some short relief, stopped as “it didn’t fix it”. Avoiding running but still lots of stairs at work. No trauma, no fevers, no other joints.  

PMHx: nil sig.  
Meds: OCP, intermitant NSAIDs.  
Allergies: NKDA.  
SHx: non‑smoker, social EtOH.  

Exam:  
Obs: BP 112/68, HR 76, afebrile, BMI ~26.  

L knee:  
No deformty, no obvious effusion. Full ROM, pain end‑range flex. TTP peripatellar esp medial/lateral facets. No joint line tendneress. Pain with patella compression + medial/lat glide, mild crepitus. Patellar grind +ve (repro typcial pain). McMurray –, Lachman/ant+post drawer stable, varus/valgus stable, no patella apprehension. Hips grossly ok. Mild antalgic gait after squats; femoral IR, over‑pronation feet bilat.  

No red flag signs for fx, signif meniscal/lig injury or inflam arthropathy.  

Assesment:  
1) L patellofemoral pain syndrome – ongoing, mechanical/anterior pattern, exam c/w PFPS. No indicatoin for MRI at this stage – clincial dx.  
2) Foot over‑pronation / biomech contrib to PF load.  
Pt very imaging/treatment focussed, needed repeated explantion of no MRI yet.  

Plan:  
- Explained dx and benign nature, not OA at 27. Discussed RACGP guideline recs – MRI/XR not helpful in straightforward PFPS, may consider if fails proper conservative tx. Pt not happy re no MRI/ortho initially but eventually agreed to trial physio etc for 6–8 wks.  
- Activty mod: avoid deep squats/kneeling where poss, try stool instead of floor with kids, reduce stairs when can, avoid running/high impact for now.  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/d). Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food up to 5–7 days for flares (no CI’s discused – GI/renal/asthma/preg).  
- Physio: written ref to local physio for structured program – hip abd/ER strength, quads (VMO) strength, stretch hams/ITB/calf. Told this is “main evidence‑based treatment”, may take weeks–months. Pt: “if I’m paying for physio I want it to actually work” – advised good evidence if she sticks with it.  
- Biomech/adjuncts: advised supportive lace‑up shoes with arch support vs flat slip‑ons. Physio to trial medial patella taping and consider prefabricated foot orthoses for over‑pronation.  
- Not doing steroid/PRP/bracing or ortho ref at this point – reserved for atypical features or failure of good conservative care +/- imaging later.  
- Investigatons: no imaging or bloods today – no trauma, no red flags, exam classic PFPS.  

Safety net:  
RTC if worse – sig swellling, locking/catching, true giving way, can’t weight bear, fever, new trauma.  

F/up:  
Review 4–6 wks after starting physio + shoe change. If no better or worse despite good adherence, will reconsider XR +/- MRI and poss sports med / ortho ref then.  

Time: ~15 mins, most on education + expecation managment and negotiating no MRI today.  

[Note: pt also briefly asked about “getting my iron checked again” – advised book separate appt for general check/bloods – not done today.]
