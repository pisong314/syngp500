New pt to practice.  

C/o L knee “bit weird, the bump’s on the side, like the front bone’s off to the side”. Worried re “bone cancer” / “growing wrong”.  

27F, retail, on feet all day, lots of squatting to low shelves.  
Pain front of L knee x ~6–8/12, gradual, no injury. Achey behind/around kneecap, sometimes sharp “jab” with squats. Worse: stairs (esp down), deep squats, sitting >30–40 mins (car/TV). Better: standing/walking flat. Takes Nurofen “when I remember”, maybe 1–2x/week. No true locking, giving way, big swelling, no fevers, wt loss, night pain.  

Prev GP apparently said “kneecap tracking problem” and suggested physio – she never went, did a few exercises then stopped. “I’m pretty bad with appointments”. No other knee issues known, no past knee surgery. NKDA. No regular meds.  

O/E  
BP 112/70, HR 76 reg, afeb. BMI ~28.  
Gait normal.  
L knee: no obvious effusion or erythema. Patella looks slightly lateral compared with R. Tibial tuberosity on L seems a bit more lateral but bony contour symmetrical, no discrete mass. Peripatellar + retropatellar tenderness L. No medial or lateral joint line tenderness. Patellar compression and glide reproduces pain, +PF grind L. Full ROM, pain at end flex esp loaded. Cruciate/collateral tests stable. Single leg squat L brings on anterior knee pain, mild valgus. Hams tight, L quads/VMO weaker vs R. Feet: mild pes planus, pronation L>R. NV intact.  

Impression  
→ Patellofemoral pain syndrome L – typical history/exam, no red flags, likely related to biomechanics (VMO weakness, hip control, pronation, lateral tuberosity position).  
→ Laterally placed L tibial tuberosity – anatomical variant, contributing to tracking but not sinister.  
→ Hx poor adherence to physio/exercise. Prognosis dependent on actually doing rehab.  

Ix  
No imaging today – explained clinical dx, no trauma/red flags, MRI/XR not needed at this stage.  

Plan (a bit rushed, end of session)  
- Reassured re: not cancer, bone not “pushed sideways” from kneeling.  
- Strongly encouraged physio for PF program: hip abductor/ER + quads/VMO strengthening, stretch hams/ITB, look at patellar taping and off‑the‑shelf orthotics given pronation. Written referral to local physio (bulk-billing options discussed briefly).  
- Showed quick starter exercises: SLRs, gentle wall sits within pain limits. Handout given.  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (max 4 g/day).  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food for up to 5 days during flares (OTC, no script). Avoid regular long‑term use.  
- Work/sitting: advised avoid deep squats/kneeling where possible, break up long sitting.  

Adherence strategies (brief): suggested tying exercises to daily routine, phone reminders for physio. Pt nods but “I’ll try… I just forget”.  

F/U 4–6/52 to review pain/function and check physio attendance. If not improving or worsening → consider plain XR and possibly sports med/ortho opinion.  

Safety net: RTC earlier or ED if acute big swelling, locking, giving way, significant trauma, or systemic sx.  

(Back pain she mentioned in passing – deferred, asked her to book separate appt if ongoing.)
