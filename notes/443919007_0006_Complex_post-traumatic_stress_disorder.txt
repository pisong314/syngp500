F/U re mood irritability sleep PTSD  

HPC  
Known cPTSD dx last yr  
Here 2/52 r/v mood  

Says "probably nothing just been abit snappy"  
On Q:  
- ongoing ↑ irritability at home + work blowing up at partner + customers raising voice throwing things x2 last month nil physical violence  
- boss commented she seems on edge pt worried re losing shifts though says "I’ll be right"

Feels sx ↑ last 3–4/12 delayed booking "didnt want to go on tablets"  

Substance use  
Alcohol most nights 3–4 premix cans nightly up to ~8 on w/e nil am drinking partner concerned  
Cannabis "couple of cones before bed" most nights  
Minimises "everyone I know drinks and smokes it helps me sleep"  

Thinks irritability maybe from energy drinks lights music in shop explained these may contribute but underlying trauma poor sleep ETOH/THC likely main drivers  

Reluctant meds "dont want to be zonked" open to "talking to someone" if culturally safe local  

Psychosocial  
Lives with female partner relationship strained by arguments partner supportive encouraged visit  
Casual retail large regional shopping centre irregular shifts incl evenings financial stress when shifts cut  
Feels disconnected from culture since moving off Country prefers Aboriginal health worker/psych if possible

Assessment  
1 cPTSD ongoing currently ↑ arousal/reactivity irritability anger outbursts hypervigilance poor conc sleep disturbance nightmares sx worse 3–4/12 impacting work home nil acute safety red flags today  
2 Problem ETOH + cannabis use using to self medicate PTSD + sleep contributing to irritability fragmented sleep mood/anx not ready for cessation some ambivalence  
3 Reluctant help seeking tends to delay r/v minimises severity reluctant pharmacotherapy referrals needs engagement focus and practical access options  

Plan  
# Psychoeducation / therapy  
Explained PTSD/cPTSD in simple terms normalised sx as trauma response not weakness  
Discussed trauma focused CBT EMDR as 1st line pt open "as long as they get mob and dont just tell me to calm down"  
eReferral done via HealthLink to local ACCHO / AMS SEWB team / Aboriginal MH worker if available otherwise psych with trauma focus exp working with Aboriginal clients preference noted  
Introduced basic grounding diaphragmatic breathing brief demo provided generic handout (Head to Health Beyond Blue links)  

# Meds  
Discussed role SSRIs/SNRIs as 1st line pharmacological adjunct for PTSD esp if sx mod–severe not sedatives take wks to work  
Pt currently reluctant to start daily meds decision to defer for now will revisit once therapy engagement underway  
Explained ETOH/THC interfere with sleep mood and will ↓ effectiveness of any future meds  

# Substance use  
Brief MI re pros/cons  
Agreed initial goals  
- Alcohol trial ≥2 alcohol free nights per week avoid >4 std drinks any one session avoid using ETOH after nightmares instead try grounding/breathing get out of bed briefly  
- Cannabis track daily use for next week nil firm reduction target yet will discuss next visit  
Provided local AOD service phone no + 24/7 helpline info pt not ready for formal ref today  

# Sleep / nightmares  
Basic sleep hygiene discussed avoid energy drinks and ETOH close to bed ↓ screens in bed try more regular pattern as roster allows  
Mentioned imagery rehearsal therapy for recurrent nightmares to be considered by psych noted on ref  
Prazosin option discussed in principle for persisting nightmares if BP allows pt prefers to "try talking stuff first" so deferred
