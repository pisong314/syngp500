2) Analgesia/NSAID request – already on OTC ibuprofen; no indication for ongoing high-dose NSAIDs/opioids  
3) ?MRI – not indicated at this stage  

P:  
- Explained sprain natural hx (4–6/52), 2/52 sx = expected. Reassured no clinical # or gross instability  
- POLICE discussed briefly; advised compression brace and elevation PM (pt nods, “I’ll try when I’m not wrecked after work”)  

Meds:  
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/day)  
- START naproxen 500mg BD with food x 5 days only (PBS gen), then STOP → if ongoing pain, use low-dose OTC ibuprofen PRN only
