Impression  
L lat ankle sprain likely G1–2 (ATFL/CFL) D4 post injury  
No clinical features # / syndesmosis / DVT / infection  
Pt anxious + high expectation for imaging  

Plan  
No repeat XR / MRI indicated today explained ligament sprain clinical dx MRI if poor progress 3–4/52  
Cont paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN (max 4g/d)  
Cont ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food x5–7d (no hx GI/renal)  
Provided proper elastic compression bandage + brief POLICE advice (protect, gradual WB as tol, ice, elevate)  
Ankle ROM + basic proprioception ex sheet given  

Referrals  
Private physio – sports focus – today if possible (pt keen)  

Work  
Med cert: unfit usual 12h nursing shifts/heavy manual handling x7d  
Adv light duties/shorter shifts after review depending progress  

Pt repeatedly requesting MRI / “stronger than Nurofen maybe codeine”  
Discussed MRI not routine for simple sprain + opioids not indicated minor soft tissue injury while pain controlled with simple anlgesia  
Agrees trial conservative mx + physio for now  

Safety net  
RTC/ED if ↑ pain/swelling, unable to WB, new deformity, redness/fever, calf pain/swelling, neuro sx  
GP review ~1/52 or earlier if worse / no improvement
