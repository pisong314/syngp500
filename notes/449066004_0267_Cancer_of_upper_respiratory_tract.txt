Telehealth – phone  

Reason  
Centrelink / Housing Commission medical form re impact of oropharyngeal Ca on fxnal capacity  

ID  
71yo Anglo‑Aus male retired construction worker lives alone in rental unit large rural town known oropharyngeal SCC HPV+ under tertiary ENT/onc  

Subjective / Hx  
Hx partly from EMR as pt poor historian forgetful with dates + tx details  
Dx oropharyngeal SCC approx 10/2024  
EMR shows stage III treated with combined CRT 11/2024→02/2025 ongoing surveillance palliative symptom focus as per tertiary ENT/onc letters  

Today  
Requesting “that Centrelink form for the cancer so I can get the payments and maybe move to a quieter unit”  
On age pension nil work for “years” form appears more about disability impact for housing/support than RTW  

Symptoms currently  
Throat discomfort chronic dysphagia esp solids has to wash food down with water  
On soft diet most days avoids meat crusty bread  
Intermittent coughing esp if drinks quickly ?microaspiration but nil hx aspiration PNA in EMR  
Voice hoarse esp later in day  
Fatigue marked “buggered just going to hang the washing out” needs rests with light tasks  
Weight – pt unsure no recent wt recorded in EMR since 03/2025 76kg then 08/2025 72kg → likely ongoing ↓wt clothes “looser than last year”  
Breathless if rushes or after 5–10 mins walk on flat but can speak full sentences on phone nil stridor nil waking SOB nil haemoptysis  

Function / ADLs (re form)  
Lives alone brother “couple of hours away” limited informal supports  
Personal ADLs independent but slower showers sitting on plastic chair due to fatigue  
IADLs does own shopping if takes time often taxi as walk from bus stop “too much”  
Stopped driving after “getting a bit mixed up at the roundabout” self‑ceased licence  
Can walk ~5–10 min on flat then needs rest due to fatigue + mild SOB  
Unable to manage heavy house/yard work “used to be on the tools now cant even mow the lawn”  

Mood / cognition  
Reports ↓mood some social withdrawal but SI nil  
Clear difficulty recalling medical hx meds timelines contradictory answers “last year no maybe this year”  
Likely mild cognitive impairment vs treatment related cognitive effects vs low health literacy  

Risk factors  
Prev long term smoker ~30–40 pack‑yrs quit 2018  
Prev high EtOH 6–8 beers/day now “odd one on the weekend”  
Occupational exposure construction work possible asbestos “white dust” and other dusts chemicals  

Meds (per EMR 10/2025 – to reconcilie F2F)  
Paracetamol 1g QID PRN  
Oxycodone 5mg 1–2 q6h PRN severe throat pain palliative script  
Omeprazole 20mg mane  
Docusate + senna nocte PRN  
Pt unsure “little white pill or is it blue” so med concordance ?  

Allergies  
NKA in EMR pt unsure “not that I know of”  

Systems focused (phone)  
Airway nil stridor nil stertor nil drooling speaking full sentences  
Resp nil cough nil haemoptysis nil fever mild exertional SOB only  
Neuro nil headaches nil facial or arm swelling SVC obstruction unlikely  
Nutrition soft diet smaller portions avoids tougher textures nil PEG  

Objective – telehealth  
No vitals  
Pt sounds tired but not in acute distress  
Speech mildly hoarse coherant full sentences nil audible stridor/wheeze over phone  
Cognition oriented but forgetful poor recall of tx and meds sequence  

Recent results (EMR)  
ENT letter 08/2025 post CRT changes residual scarring nil frank airway obstruction plan surveillance q6/12  
CT neck/chest 07/2025 post‑rad changes nil SVC obstruction nil central airway mass  
No imaging since then  

Assessment  
1 Oropharyngeal SCC HPV+ stage III post CRT  
   Currently clinically stable by hx with chronic dysphagia hoarseness fatigue  
   Nil current red flag airway sx on phone hx however high risk future airway compromise aspiration progressive wt loss fxnal decline  
   Ongoing tertiary ENT/onc r/v q6/12 as per head and neck Ca guidelines  

2 Functional limitation / disability 2° malignancy + tx effects  
   71yo retired heavy construction worker  
   Marked ↓exercise tolerance ~5–10 min walk then rest  
   Unable heavy domestic or yard work soft diet dependence pacing of ADLs  
   Lives alone limited supports at risk social isolation  
   Unlikely to have realistic capacity for future physical employment prognosis chronic likely permanent fxnal impact  

3 Cognitive concerns – poor historian ?mild cognitive impairment vs chemo brain vs low health literacy  
   Difficulty recalling meds appts timelines ↑risk med mismanagement missed oncology r/v  
   Needs more formal cognitive screen MMSE/MoCA and collateral hx F2F  

4 Psychosocial / support needs  
   Some low mood but SI nil  
   Struggles with forms systems “gets confused with all the forms”  
   Likely to benefit from structured supports My Aged Care community services transport  

Plan  

#1 Centrelink / Housing medical form  
Completed form during consult based on EMR + pt hx  
Documented  
- Dx oropharyngeal SCC post CRT under tertiary ENT/onc care  
- Prognosis chronic with ongoing morbidity risk of progression permanent impact on heavy physical work  
- Fxnal impact as above limited mobility fatigue soft diet cant do heavy house/yard work requires low maintenance housing close to services  
Scanned copy to record  
Advised may need update if condition changes  

#2 Ongoing cancer care / complications monitoring  
Reinforced importance of keeping ENT/onc appts at tertiary centre  
Safety net  
ED/000 if  
- new or worsening noisy breathing stridor loud snoring‑type noise when awake  
- sudden inability to swallow with drooling or unable to manage secretions  
- acute severe SOB chest pain haemoptysis confusion or rapid onset facial/arm swelling  
Asked to book long F2F r/v here in next 2–3 wks for  
- wt BP general exam nutritional assessment  
- med reconciliation bring all boxes/blister packs  
- cognitive screen + mood assessment  
- consider refs dietitian speech pathologist for dysphagia local palliative care team for symptom control advance care planning as per national palliative guidelines  

#3 Psychosocial / supports  
Discussed potential My Aged Care referral community nursing transport help domestic support  
Pt interested but overwhelmed by admin  
Plan My Aged Care referral at next long F2F once consent confirmed may involve brother if available  
Encouraged to bring family/friend to assist with hx and planning  

#4 Lifestyle / education  
Smoking cessation maintained reinforced  
EtOH – advised keep to occasional low risk intake  
Explained balanced nutrition more important than strict sugar avoidance in context Ca + wt loss offered oncology dietitian ref at next visit  
Acknowledged concern re asbestos / construction dust exposure likely contributory RF but not modifiable now noted in hx for any future compensation queries  

Time  
Phone consult ~15 mins majority on functional assessment + form completion some safety netting  
Non urgent items cognitive screen detailed mood workup My Aged Care paperwork deferred to next long F2F  

F/U  
Book long F2F appt 2–3/52 or earlier if clinical deterioration or new red flag sx
