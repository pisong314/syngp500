27yo M sparky – “general check-up” but mainly foreskin issue once prompted.

Hx all over the place re duration – says “few months or maybe since last year”. Tight foreskin, harder to pull back esp when erect. Some small cracks at edge, stings a bit if split. No discharge, no fevers, no dysuria/haematuria. No hx urinary retention, stream ok (“maybe a bit slower if really tight”). No ballooning. Not sexually active currently, no known STI hx, declined STI screen today (“another time, got to get back to work”).

No known DM, denies classic sx. No regular meds, NKDA. No prior urology surgery.

Exam (brief – chaperone offered, declined):  
Vitals ok – BP 122/74, HR 72, afebrile, BMI ~25. Abd soft, no SP tenderness.  
Genital: foreskin won’t fully retract even when flaccid, tight fibrotic ring at preputial opening, some mild erythema and old healed fissures, no obvious discharge or ulceration, glans partly seen only. Meatus normal. Testes normal, no hernia, no inguinal LAD. No evidence paraphimosis, no acute infection.

Impression:  
– Pathological phimosis, mild–mod, symptomatic, no obstruction, no acute balanitis.  
– Need to r/o diabetes as contributing factor.

Plan (ran out of time for “general check” + back pain – asked to book separate appt):  
- Betamethasone 0.05% cream: apply small amount to tight ring bd x 6/52 with gentle retraction only to mild tension. Told him to avoid harsh/ perfumed soaps on foreskin, just warm water, stop if cracking/bleeding.  
- Explained if no improvement 6–8/52 or worsening → urology for circumcision vs preputioplasty (public vs private briefly discussed, regional centre likely).  
- Red flags: ED if can’t pull foreskin back over glans (paraphimosis), can’t pass urine, marked swelling, severe pain, fevers or pus.  

Investigations ordered (S&N form given – asked to go fasting):  
- Fasting BGL  
- HbA1c  
- Urine ACR  

Review 4/52 to check response to steroid + stretching and review results. RTC earlier if worse/concern.

Billing: standard consult, bulk billed.
