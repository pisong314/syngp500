76yo M – new pt, bulk billed walk‑in  

CC:  
“keep getting light‑headed / crook when its warm or standing round too long”, near blackouts, no full LOC.  

Hx:  
Longstanding “low BP when I stand up”. DLB dx by neuro ~2y ago, T2DM >10y on “sugar tablets” (likely metformin) but ran out “few weeks ago”. Poor med adherance, misses appts.  
Sx worse last month – malls, hot shower, queues, after sitting upright a while. Relieved by lying down. No CP, no palp, no focal neurosx, no SOB. 2–3 near falls at night to toilet, no injury.  

Meds (unclear):  
- ?Metformin – out of tablets now  
- ?Donepezil / ?rivastigmine  
- prev “BP pill” stopped as made him dizzy, name unkown  
No Webster.  

Ex:  
Thin elderly male, mildy dishevled, coop but vague.  
BP supine 132/76 HR 66 → stand imm 104/60 HR 68 → 3min 98/58 HR 70.  
→ clear postural drop >20 syst / >10 dias with minimal HR rise – c/w autonomic failure / neurogenic OH.  
HS dual, no murmur, chest clear. Brief neuro – shuffly gait, mild resting tremor, no gross focal deficit.  

Impresson:  
1) Orthostatic hypotension – likely neurogenic in context DLB + DM/autonomic failure. Symptomatic presyncope, high falls risk.  
2) T2DM – control unknown, currently off meds, ?peripheral neuropathy.  
3) DLB – cognitive impairement, poor adherence, needs carer involvment.  

Plan:  
- Orthostatic OH  
  • Non‑pharm advice re slow position change, avoid long standing / hot envrionments, ↑fluids (simple terms).  
  • Discussed compression stockings – pt relucatnt but advised may help.  
  • No anti‑HTN started/restarted today given clear postural drop + uncertain hx.  
  • Falls safety discussed briefly (night light, support when mobilising).  

- Diabetes  
  • Restart low‑dose metformin 500mg mane with food (PBS) as temp measure till results back – counselled re GI upset, stop if severe abdo pain / D&V.  
  • Path ordered (bulk billed): FBE, U&E/Cr/eGFR, LFTs, HbA1c, fasting lipids, BSL, urine ACR.  
  • Will adjust DM meds once results + old records avail, consider other agents depending renal fn + HbA1c.  

- DLB / adherence  
  • Strongly requested wife attend next review with all meds / boxes.  
  • Suggested Webster/dosette via local pharmacy.  
  • Longer appt later for full cog + falls + supports (My Aged Care etc).  

- Records:  
  • Need to chase prior GP / neuro letters re dx, previous meds, BP/DM hx before considering fludrocortisone / midodrine etc.  

Safety net:  
- Adv to attend ED / call amb if actual faint, fall with injury, new CP, SOB, focal neuro sx or worsened confuson.  

Follow‑up:  
- Book standard f/up in ~1 week (same GP if poss) – review bloods, reconcile meds, orthostatic sx, bring wife + all pill bottles.
