24F f/up BSLs – actually BP results / postural dizziness  

Hx  
Ongoing “low BP / dizzy when stand up too fast”  
On NaCl 600mg bd since last review – taking  
Still pre-syncope ~3–4x/wk, esp am, queues at uni, long café shifts, hot days  
No syncope  
No CP, palps, SOB, neuro sx, fever, GI loss  
?worse after big carb lunches + lots of coffee  
On COCP, no missed pills  

O/E  
Looks well, NAD  
Postural vitals:  
Lying 104/68 HR64  
Stand 0min 86/60 HR86  
Stand 3min 84/58 HR92  
→ sig postural drop, mild light-headed on standing only, settles quickly  
CVS/resp abdo grossly N  

Path (SNP QML last visit)  
FBC N (Hb 127)  
UEC N (Na 138, K 4.1, eGFR >90)  
LFT N  
TFT N (TSH 1.7)  
Fasting BSL 4.8  
Ferritin 28 (low–N)  

Impr  
1) Orthostatic hypotension / orthostatic intolerance – young well 24F, likely constitutional + contribs (heat, prolonged standing, big carb meals, high caffeine, ↓sleep). No red flags for cardiac / endocrine / renal / neuro cause on screen so far  
2) Borderline low iron stores – no anaemia  

Plan  
– Reassured re benign nature currently, no syncope / red flags  
– Cont NaCl tabs 600mg bd for now  
– Encourage ↑fluids (aim ≥2–2.5L/d) & moderate ↑salt in diet  
– Postural advice: slow position changes, avoid prolonged standing where poss, legs up if presyncopal  
– Trial ↓caffeine (≤2–3 coffees/d) + smaller meals re ?post-prandial drop  
– Consider compression stockings on long café shifts  
– Iron: diet ↑ Fe (meat/legumes/greens + vit C). No Fe tabs yet, monitor  
– Symptom diary 2–3/52 (timing, triggers, severity)  
– RTC / ED if syncope, CP, palps, SOB, neuro sx  

F/up  
Review 4–6/52 for BP + sx. Repeat postural BP then.  
If ongoing sig sx despite conservative Mx → consider tilt table / cardiology or gen med opinion  

[Added 16:30 by Dr Kaur – pathology results checked again, all N as above, no further tests ordered today. Sleep/stress around exams noted but not fully explored – defer to next review]
