Pt: 29F, primary school teacher  

Reason: "feeling really low and worried about my health", hoarse voice + sore throat ~5 days  

HPI:  
- 5/7 hoarsness + sore throat, started after big week of paret-teacher interviews, lots of talking / raising voice  
- mild dysphagia only due to soreness, still eating/drinking ok, no choking  
- no fevers/rigors, no night sweats, no sig cough, no SOB, no stridor  
- had mild nasal congestion start of week, now betetr  
- non smoker, no passive smoke, no recent intubaton, no chem exposure  
- very anxious re "throat cancer" and "silent reflux" after googling. Repeats "are you sure it's not something serious, should I get a scan or camera?"  

Mood / MH:  
- Reports feeling "really down and teary" this week, clearly linked to throat worries  
- longstanding pattern health anx, frequent checks, but no formal dx depression/anx previously  
- sleep broken, ruminating on throat, appetite ok, still working but says "hard to focus"  
- enjoying time with partner/freinds when distracted, so no clear anhedonia  
- denies SI / self harm, no ETOH excess, no drugs  
- on phone sounds tearful at times, thought content dominated by catstrophic health worries, no psychotic sx  

SHx: lives with partner, works FT teacher, high voice use  

Meds/allergies:  
- No regular meds  
- NKDA  

Exam/obs (tele):  
- Speaking full sentnces, voice hoarse but clear  
- No audible stridor, no laboured breathing, not short of breath on phone  
- Drinking water during call without difficutly  
- Alert, orientated, anxious affect  

Impression:  
1) Acute laryngitis – likely viral / voice strain related  
   - Short duration, post heavy voice use, mild URTI sx, no red flags, non-smoker  
   - Malignancy very unlikely given hx + time course  

2) Health anxiety / adjustment-type low mood  
   - Reactive low mood centred on current sx and fear of serious illness  
   - No current risk issues, but ongoing health anx pattern – needs longer MH review  

Plan:  
Acute laryngitis:  
- Reassured re benign, self-limiting nature, explained no indicatoin for ABx or steriods at this stage  
- Voice rest as able, hydration, simple measures (steam etc) – briefly discussed  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1g PO q6h PRN (max 4g/24h) – advised OTC  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg PO TDS PRN with food if needed, no hx asthma/ulcer/renal per pt  
- No meds changed/ceased (N/A)  
- Safety net: attend ED / urgent review if ↑SOB, stridor, can’t swallow fluids, drooling, high fevers or feels very unwell  

MH / health anx:  
- Normalised some worry but pointed out pattern of catastrophsing  
- Brief psycho-ed re "Dr Google", suggested limiting online searching, recommended Healthdirect etc  
- Discussed option MHCP + CBT-based psych for health anx – pt "keen but wanna fix the throat first"  
- Plan longer 20–30 min review (F2F or tele) in 1–2/52 for full MH assess + consider MHCP/referral  

Ix:  
- None today – explained early, uncomplicated laryngitis, invx (bloods / scans / scope) not helpful now and may worsen anx. Pt still asking "are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests?" – reiterated rationale  

Work:  
- If still hoarse and struggling to teach by Monday, advised can call back for med cert – deferred for now  

F/U:  
- Review 7–10 days if not improving, earlier if any red flags as above  
- Book separate longer MH appt in 1–2/52  

Pt understanding:  
- Pt verbalises understanding but remains quite anx, repeatedly asks if "100% not cancer". Reassured based on current info, emphasised need to RTC if change in sx or new concerns.
