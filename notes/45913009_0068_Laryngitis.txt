No SOB, no stridor, no CP, no dysphagia/odynophagia. Eating/drinking ok. No fevers x5–6d.  
Non-smoker. No reflux sx. No wt loss, no B sx. No prev similar prolonged hoarseness.  

Meds

Ex  
Obs WNL (afeb, sats 99% RA). Well, speaking in hoarse/breathy voice but full sentences, NAD.  
ENT: mild pharyngeal erythema, no exudate, no tonsillar ↑, no oral lesions. Neck NT, no LN↑, no masses. Chest clear, no wheeze/stridor.  

Ix  
Nil today – clinically c/w viral laryngitis. ENT scope only if persists >4/52 or red flags. No path ordered. (Prev review 03/05/23 15/08/24 labs all WNL)  

Dx  
1) Acute laryngitis on resolving viral URTI – day ~10  
   - heavy occupational voice use → sx worse at work  
   - no red flags (non-smoker, afeb, -ve wt loss, -ve dysphagia, -ve stridor)  
2) Temp ↓ capacity for usual teaching duties – Centrelink/HR paperwork  

Plan  
- Reassured typical course; may take 2–3/52 to fully settle in heavy voice users  
- Voice rest as able, avoid shouting/whispering, keep hydrated  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/d). Can trial ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN short term if no GI/renal issues  
- No abx, no steroids indicated – pt happy to avoid “extra meds”  
- Centrelink med cert + separate work certificate done: dx acute laryngitis, limited capacity for full classroom teaching; fit for light/modified duties (↓ prolonged speaking) for ~7–10d. Suggested up to 5 more days sick leave / modified role  
- RTC/ED if SOB, stridor, ↑ pain swallowing, drooling, high fevers, neck swelling  
- Review if not much better by 2/52, ENT ref if hoarseness >4/52  

Pt: “Should I be worried it’s still croaky after a week and a half?” → reassured, understands plan.
