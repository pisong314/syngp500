CC: eye “swelling” L>R

HPC  
Few months bilat eye discomfort “burning and gritty, like sand”, worse last 1–2/52. ↑blur later in day, with reading/TV.  
Last night L eye “really cloudy and puffy, like there was a film over it”, slow to clear this am → wife made him call.  
Mild photophobia only. No halos, no severe pain, no N/V, no purulent d/c, some watery tearing.  
Vision “a bit worse than it used to be but probably just old age”. No curtain, flashes, floaters. No trauma/FB/chemicals. No CL use. Last optom ~2 yrs ago.  
Hx “dry eyes” in past, poor adherence to drops (“I don’t really like taking tablets or using drops all the time”).  
Denies fever, facial rash, jt pains. Occasional dry mouth only.

Allergies: NKDA

Exam (phone only)  
No red flag sx by Hx as above. Able to read newspaper if brighter light + more breaks. Speech clear, mildly slow. No reported inability to close eyes.

Impression  
1) Exacerbation chronic dry eye / KCS in setting PD (↓blink, enviro factors – heater, screen)  
2) Episode cloudy vision L ?corneal involvement vs other corneal pathology – needs F2F eye exam to r/o more serious cause. No clear Hx for acute angle closure / retinal detachment but cannot exclude by phone  
3) PD – stable by Hx  
4) Known poor adherence / delayed presentation (“I nearly didn’t call, it’s probably nothing”)

Plan  
- Strongly advised F2F eye review ≤24–48h  
  → Pt to book local optom this week (pref) for VA, IOP, cornea check. Will arrange ophthal referral if optom/GP finds sig corneal damage/oedema etc. Pt reluctant re “another specialist” but agrees to optom (“need new glasses anyway”).  
  → Also booked F2F review here 1/52 (earlier if worse) for own eye exam + BP etc.

- Start OTC preservative‑free lubricating eye drops QID both eyes + PRN  
  → explained likely need for frequent use, PF due to frequency  
  → Night gel/ointment both eyes nocte (warned temp blur). Wife to help remind. 2/52 trial.

- Non‑pharm (brief): avoid direct heater, ↑breaks from screen, maintain hydration.  

- PD context: explained PD + ↓blink → ↑risk dry eye, need regular drops not just when “real bad”.

Safety net  
Red flags: sudden severe eye pain, marked redness, sudden ↓vision, halos, headache, N/V, “curtain” or new flashes/floaters → ED / 000. Pt + wife verbalise understanding.  

F/up  
F2F 1/52 or sooner if deterioration. Revisit need ophthal (e.g. ciclosporin, punctal plugs) if severe / poor response. PD/falls review deferred – longer appt 4–6/52.
