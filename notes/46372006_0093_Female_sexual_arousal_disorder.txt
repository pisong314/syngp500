57F f/up  

CC: vax “everything I’m due for” + ongoing low libido  

Hx:  
Wants “the pneumonia one, the shingles one, and whatever COVID and flu you’ve got… just get it all done today”. Frustrated re access “sick of waiting weeks for an appt”.  
Vax hx:  
- Flu: ? “couple of years ago”  
- COVID: 2-dose primary 2021, no boosters  
- Shingles: nil  
- Pneumo: unsure, none on AIR  
No recent febrile illness, no prev vax rxn, no anaphylaxis, not on anticoag  

Mentions feeling “a bit off” last few wks, blames “mould in the office aircon” and “hormones + sex drive”. No sig resp sx.  

Known HSDD / low libido post-meno + VVA. On oestriol PV 2–3x/wk but admits often forgetting. Dryness a bit better, still ↓ desire, ↓ arousal, orgasm diff. Pen sex sometimes still “uncomfy” if misses oestriol.  
Mood stable, denies dep / SI. Some work stress, hours cut. No SSRIs/opioids etc. PMHx no IHD, DM, breast Ca, VTE.  

Today strongly requesting testosterone: “My friend’s doc put her on testosterone and she’s a new woman… why can’t you just do that today as well?” Wants “proper stuff, not more cream that does nothing”.  
Expl TGA restrictions, off-label use, need full risk assess + longer consent. Pt pushing back “I don’t have time for all these hoops”. Agrees (reluctantly) to longer appt later.  

O/E:  
Gen well, NAD, mildly impatient, on phone  
BP 128/76 HR 76 afeb SpO₂ 99% RA BMI ~28 (prev)  
No contra to vax. Pelvic deferred (done prev, no new sx)  

Impr:  
1) Vax catch-up 57F – due flu, COVID booster, shingles, likely pneumo  
2) HSDD / female sexual interest/arousal disorder post-meno – chronic, distressing, multifactorial, suboptimal oestriol adherence, requesting T  
3) VVA – partial response to oestriol, intermittent dyspareunia  

Plan:  
1) Vax today  
- Check AIR + practice record → no shingles/pneumo recorded  
- Give today (nurse):  
  • Flu vax (current season, IM)  
  • COVID-19 booster (mRNA, as per ATAGI)  
- Discussed Shingrix (2-dose, likely private cost) + pneumo (Pneumovax 23 as per age schedule). Pt keen “just do it”.  
- Arranged with PN now for Shingrix dose 1 + Pneumovax 23 if stock/PBS eligibility confirmed. If no stock → PN to book nurse clinic  
- Brief SE / red flag advice, RTC if sig rxn  

2) HSDD / low libido  
- Reiterated common post-meno, not “broken hormones”  
- Not starting T today – need dedicated review: assess cardiometabolic risk, breast hx, discuss limited evidence, SE (acne, hirsutism, virilisation), avoid male/compounded prep  
- Pt frustrated “I still don’t see why you can’t just try it” → explained safety / medico-legal, she eventually accepts longer appt  
- Interim: encourage regular oestriol PV 2–3x/wk, lubricants PRN, comms with partner  
- At long appt (note for self):  
  • Detailed sexual / relationship / MH hx  
  • Check old bloods, order fasting lipids, HbA1c/glucose, LFTs if >12/12  
  • Consider systemic MHT / tibolone if broader meno sx  
  • Discuss non-pharm (psychosexual therapy, CBT, sex therapist)  
  • Consider low-dose female T gel if persistent distress >6/12, no contra, with monitoring plan  

3) VVA  
- Continue oestriol PV 0.5mg 2–3x/wk, emphasise adherence  
- Moisturiser / lubricant suggestions (brief)  
- Reconsider pelvic exam at long review if still painful  

Ix today: nil (time, vax focus). Bloods next long appt as above  

F/up:  
- PN now for vax as arranged  
- Book long 20–30 min consult 2–4/52 specifically for sexual function / meno / possible MHT or T and psychosexual referral  
- RTC earlier if vaccine reaction, new breast sx, mood change, pelvic pain
