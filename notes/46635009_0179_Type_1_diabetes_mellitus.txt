P  
Cough  
- Explained post-viral cough common 2–3/52 sometimes longer, no current indication CXR  
- Agreed defer Ix today unless persists or red flags  
- Symptomatic only: saline nasal spray/irrigation, fluids, honey/simple linctus PRN  
- May trial OTC dextromethorphan nocte short term – avoid codeine  

T1DM  
- Reinforced sick day plan: DO NOT stop basal, ↑BGL checks (q4h while awake), adjust bolus to BGL + intake  
- Check blood ketones if BGL >15 x2 or feels systemically unwell → ED if ketones >1.5 or DKA sx  
- No change insulin doses today  

Health anxiety  
- Brief reassurance re very low cancer/PNA risk given age, exam  
- Offered future discussion re MHCP/psych – pt “maybe next time”  

Ix  
Nil today – plan CXR ± further w/u (spirometry etc) if cough >4/52 or earlier if new sx  

Safety net  
RTC 7–10/7 if no improvement, earlier if ↑SOB, CP, haemoptysis, high fevers, feels acutely unwell  
ED if DKA features as above  

F/up  
- GP review 10–14/7 if ongoing cough  
- Longer 20–30 min appt 4–6/52 for full T1DM + MH review
