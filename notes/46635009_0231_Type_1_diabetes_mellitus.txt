32F review – LBP + T1DM  

LBP  
- 10/7 mid→lower lumbar, R>L, dull ache + sharp twinge on flexion/lift  
- Insidious onset, no trauma, no single heavy lift  
- Worse end of teaching day / marking at table, better lying flat + heat  
- No radicular sx, no neuro sx, no bowel/bladder change, no night pain, no wt loss, no fevers, no hx Ca  
- No urinary sx, no CVA pain  
- Very anxious re “cancer or kidneys”, asking for MRI “to be sure”  
- New firmer mattress ~3/52 + ↑ gardening may have triggered  
- Analgesia so far: ibuprofen 400 mg up to TDS x4/7 + paracetamol PRN  

Exam back  
Gait normal, SLR -ve bilat, mild R paraspinal tenderness L3–5, no midline tenderness, power/sensation/reflexes LL normal, no saddle anaesthesia, no CVA tenderness  

Ix today  
- Urine dip: SG 1.020, pH6, no protein/blood/nitrites/leucs, gluc +, no ketones  
- BGL 7.8 pre-lunch  

T1DM / co-morbid  
- T1DM dx 17yo. Basal–bolus: Optisulin 18u nocte, NovoRapid with meals (carb count). SMBG ~6–8x/d. Interested CGM  
- Last HbA1c 7.3% ~3/12 (prev 7.1%? – check old result)  
- UEC/LFT/lipids/TSH all WNL ~6/12 ago. ACR normal ~1/12 ago. Retinal screen 18/12 ago – normal → due soon  
- Few mild hypos last month on busy teaching days, self-treated, no LOC  
- Coeliac on strict GF diet, serology -ve last yr  
- Autoimmune hypothyroid on thyroxine 100 mcg mane, clinically euthyroid  

Mental health  
Longstanding health anxiety. Today “I just want full body bloods to check for cancer and kidney damage”. Lots of Dr Google. Needs high reassurance.  

A/P  
1) Mechanical NSLBP – acute 10/7, no red flags, MSK strain likely (posture/gardening), kidneys unlikely  
   - Reassured extensively re benign exam + normal urine, no indication imaging now  
   - Analgesia: paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN; ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food max total 5–7/7 then stop  
   - Warned re NSAID + kidneys esp with DM  
   - Encourage activity, avoid prolonged sitting; heat pack ok  
   - Physio referral done (local physio – letter printed / sent via EMR)  
   - Red flags discussed – RTC/ED if neuro deficit, bowel/bladder change, fevers, wt loss, severe unrelenting pain  

2) T1DM – reasonable control, no acute issue today  
   - Cont current insulin regimen  
   - Reinforce carry hypo tx + glucagon (teach partner next visit)  
   - SMBG ≥4–6x/d  
   - Path forms printed today for upcoming DM review (pt keen to “check everything”): HbA1c, UEC, LFT, fasting lipids, urine ACR, TSH, coeliac serology  
   - CGM option to be discussed more at dedicated DM appt  

3) Coeliac – stable GF diet → monitor via annual serology (ordered)  

4) Autoimmune hypothyroid – stable, TSH due (ordered)  

5) Health anxiety  
   - Validated concerns, explained stepwise approach rather than “full body tests”  
   - Suggested psych/CBT – pt “too busy in term” but will think about it  
   - Plan: trial conservative mgmt LBP 2–3/52; if no better or new red flags → reconsider imaging  

Follow-up  
- Review LBP 2–3/52 or earlier if worse/red flags  
- Book longer DM/chronic dz + MH review 4–6/52 (school hols) once bloods back – full foot check, vax, CGM, glucagon education etc  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – ignore, old recalls – new recall set for DM review as above.
