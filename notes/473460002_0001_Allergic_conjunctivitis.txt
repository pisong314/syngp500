Ongoing bilat red itchy eyes watery discharge worse @school and outdoors esp windy days  
Nil purulent d/c nil lids stuck AM nil sig pain nil photophobia nil ↓vision nil FB sensation nil trauma nil CL use  

Strongly convinced infection from kids  
"youre wrong I know my body this is an infection not allergies"  
Requesting chloramphenicol "like I always give the kids" challenging advice "you doctors never listen"   

Hx seasonal sneeze rhinorrhoea each spring worse this wk high pollen reported in media uses loratadine intermittently not regular nil asthma nil eczema  

Nil fever malaise URTI sx nil sick contacts home  

Meds nil regular NKDA

Eyes  
VA 6/6 OU with pinhole  
Lids normal nil crusting  
Conj bilat diffuse injection more palpebral marked chemosis esp inf  
Watery clear d/c nil mucopurulent  
Cornea clear nil staining on fluorescein nil FB  
PERRL nil RAPD EOMI nil pain  
Nil preauricular LAD  

Nose pale boggy mucosa clear rhinorrhoea  
Throat clear chest clear nil wheeze  

Behaviour argumentative repeatedly requesting abx required repeated reassurance became mildly confrontational when abx declined  

A  
1 Allergic conjunctivitis bilat ongoing likely seasonal aeroallergen related  
Clinical picture c/w allergic rather than bacterial/viral as per RACGP red eye guidance  
Prominent itch watery d/c bilat involvement normal VA nil pain or photophobia nil mucopurulent d/c afebrile nil CL nil trauma nil red flag features for keratitis uveitis acute glaucoma etc  

2 Allergic rhinitis seasonal under treated  

P  
# Allergic conjunctivitis  
Explained dx and reasoning in detail emphasised  
- itch + watery d/c  
- bilat symmetrical involvement  
- normal VA no pain photophobia  
- absence mucopurulent d/c or systemic sx  
Discussed topical abx eg chloramphenicol not indicated here unlikely benefit potential harm incl resistance allergy pt disagreed but informed  

Meds  
- Start olopatadine 0.1% gtts 1 gtt OU BD during symptomatic period advise may take 1–2/7 for max effect PBS  
- Continue lubricating saline drops PRN up to hourly  
- Cool compresses over closed lids PRN itch chemosis  
- Oral antihistamine suggested cetirizine 10mg nocte or loratadine 10mg mane PRN high pollen days pt familiar  

Avoidance / self care  
Advise minimise eye rubbing frequent handwashing esp after classroom materials  
Try avoid sitting near open windows on windy high pollen days  
Acknowledged concern re new eco cleaning products suggested observe if sx clearly worse post cleaning and discuss with school OHS if pattern though likely pollen main trigger rather than almond milk etc  

Safety net  
Advised urgent r/v or ED if  
- sudden ↓vision  
- sig eye pain or marked photophobia  
- unilateral severe redness or corneal haze  
- d/c becomes thick pus like  
If nil improvement after 5–7/7 regular tx will escalate  

If poor response or atypical features develop plan optometrist or ophthalmology opinion  

# Allergic rhinitis  
Start intranasal corticosteroid  
- Fluticasone furoate 27.5mcg 2 sprays each nostril mane x 1/52 then 1–2 sprays each nostril mane through allergy season  
Technique demonstrated written instructions given  
Explained nasal allergy control often → improvement ocular sx  

# Investigations  
None indicated typical allergic picture explained to pt that routine bloods eye swabs not useful in this context she queried lack of "tests"  

Other issues  
Pt raised feeling "tired all the time" requesting "full blood check" today discussed time constraints and need for separate standard appt to explore fatigue and consider bloods thyroid iron etc asked to book  

F/U  
R/V 1/52 or earlier if worsening to assess response to olopatadine + nasal steroid  
If still symptomatic or any red flags will refer optom/ophthal for further assessment
