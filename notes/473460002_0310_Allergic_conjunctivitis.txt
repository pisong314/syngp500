Impression  
# Allergic conjunctivitis R>L likely seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ± contact irritant 2° new eye products  
No red flags nil pain nil photophobia nil ↓vision nil corneal signs so bacterial conjunctivitis / keratitis / uveitis unlikely  
# Mild allergic rhinitis  

Pt initially very insistent on abx drops "my old GP always gives them" time spent explaining allergic vs bacterial picture lack of indication for abx and abx overuse pt ultimately accepted though not entirely happy  

Ix  
Nil bloods or imaging indicated today  

Plan  
- Stop new eye cream makeup remover and current OTC drops ?preservative related irritation  
- Start olopatadine 0.1% oph drops 1 gtt OU BD during symptomatic period PBS  
- Preservative free lubricating artificial tears PRN q4–6h  
- Cool compresses PRN itch avoid rubbing eyes  

- For nasal sx and ongoing control  
  → Suggested OTC non sedating oral antihist eg cetirizine 10mg mane PRN high pollen days  
  → If rhinitis worsens can add intranasal steroid spray at later r/v  

Safety net  
Explained olopatadine should start to help itch within hours to 1–2 days  
Advised avoid vasoconstrictor "get the red out" drops eg naphazoline re rebound redness  
Red flag advice given  
→ urgent GP or ED if ↑pain marked photophobia ↓vision copious purulent d/c marked swelling or rapid deterioration  

Work  
Pt to remain at work teaching Mon ok reassured allergic not contagious emphasised hand hygiene avoid touching eyes  
No med cert requested  

F/U

Needs longer appt 20–30min with usual GP for full skin check + work stress discussion noted in file for f/u
