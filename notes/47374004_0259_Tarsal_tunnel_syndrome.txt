Context  
Working ↑ hrs on feet staff shortages  
Says has been rushing meals lots of coffee trialling new chilli dip at work wonders if this is irritating stomach  
Also queries if new tighter ankle brace for tarsal tunnel (started 3/7 ago) could affect "circulation or nerves" to stomach reassured unlikely

Tarsal tunnel brief r/v  
Ongoing medial ankle / foot tingling burning by end of shift consistent with prev dx  
Some improvement with brace + orthotics still flares when on registers too long  
↑ ibuprofen use this wk as above asks if "Nurofen could be upsetting my stomach" advised likely contributor

On guided self palpation nil marked focal tenderness guarding or rigidity described pain mainly epigastric discomfort / pressure  

Assessment  
1 Epigastric / central abdo pain likely gastritis / dyspepsia 2° NSAID use ± dietary triggers  
Pattern meal related epigastric crampy temporal assoc with several days regular ibuprofen plus spicy / acidic foods → likely gastric irritation / dyspepsia  
Nil current red flags on Hx telehealth limitations noted  

DDx discussed  
– NSAID related gastritis / uncomplicated dyspepsia most likely  
– PUD ? esp with NSAID use though sx short duration  
– Biliary colic less likely nil RUQ pain nil fatty food trigger  
– Pancreatitis unlikely nil severe constant pain nil radiation to back nil sig N/V nil heavy EtOH  
– Early appendicitis considered but nil migration to RIF nil fevers nil anorexia bowels normal  
– Gyn causes unlikely by Hx LMP 2/52 regular nil pelvic sx  

2 Tarsal tunnel syndrome L ankle known dx stable sx  
Neuropathic type pain / paraesthesia end of shifts still present  
↑ oral NSAID use contributing to gastritis risk  
Requires F2F r/v for chronic pain plan ↓ NSAID reliance workplace mods  

Plan  

# Abdo pain suspected NSAID related gastritis / dyspepsia  
– Cease ibuprofen and other oral NSAIDs for now  
– Start PPI esomeprazole 20mg mane 30 mins pre breakfast for 2–4/52 PBS script  
– Analgesia: paracetamol 1g up to QID PRN pain max 4g/24h  
– Avoid aspirin other OTC NSAID products  

Diet / lifestyle (brief)  
– Smaller regular meals avoid large heavy late dinners  
– ↓ coffee to ≤2/day avoid very spicy / acidic foods and fizzy drinks short term  
– Avoid lying flat 2–3h post meals  
– Limit EtOH until sx settled  

Safety net  
Advised urgent ED / 000 if  
• sudden severe ↑ pain esp if localises RIF or RUQ  
• persistent vomiting or unable to keep fluids down  
• haematemesis or coffee ground vomit  
• melaena or fresh PR blood  
• high fever rigors collapse chest pain or SOB  
If pain persists >5–7/7 despite PPI or worsens at any time to book urgent F2F for exam bloods ± imaging  

Investigations  
Nil ordered today given short duration sx and likely uncomplicated dyspepsia stepwise approach  
If persisting or any alarm features at r/v will consider  
– FBC U&E/Cr LFTs lipase CRP  
– H pylori stool Ag or breath test  
– Abdo US if atypical features  
– Gastroscopy referral if ongoing dyspepsia or red flags  

# Tarsal tunnel syndrome  
– Explained frequent oral NSAID use likely contributing to gastric sx  
– Advise continue orthotics ankle brace but ensure not overtight  
– Non NSAID strategies: stretching / foot ankle exs simple measures discussed in brief written sheet to be given F2F  
– Consider topical NSAID gel local application as alt to oral lower systemic risk  
– At longer F2F r/v plan to  
  • reassess sx and impact conc@work  
  • discuss physio ref  
  • consider letter to employer re more seated tasks shorter standing blocks  
  • consider neuropathic pain options eg low dose amitriptyline or gabapentin if indicated to reduce NSAID reliance  

Follow up  
– F2F or telehealth r/v in 5–7/7 to reassess abdo pain response to PPI pt prefers after work hours to book  
– Earlier F2F if nil improvement over next 48–72h  
– Separate longer appt in next 2–3/52 for comprehensive tarsal tunnel / pain management review pt agreeable  

Pt understanding  
Pt attentive asked re seriousness of ibuprofen side effects explained risk gastritis / ulcer and key warning sx  
Pt able to repeat back red flags coherantly  
Agreed to stop ibuprofen start PPI modify diet as above  
Reliability with f/u and meds appears good
