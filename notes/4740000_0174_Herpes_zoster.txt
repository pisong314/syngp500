42M Aboriginal, HIV+ on ART (Royal [city] Hosp)  

Reason: wants repeat valaciclovir “just in case”  

Hx: shingles L thoracic ~3/52 ago  
→ seen here then, valaciclovir 1g tds 7/7 completed  
Rash now healed ~5/7, only mild intermittent tingling / brief stabbing pains  
No new vesicles, no spread, no fever, sleep/work ok, no reg analgesia  
No eye/face/ear involvement, no neuro red flags by hx  

Meds:  
- TAF/FTC + DTG daily (pt says fully adherent)  
- PRN paracetamol  
- Valaciclovir course finished  

Allergies: NKDA  

O/E (brief): looks well, rushed  
BP 124/78 HR 76 afeb SpO₂ 99% RA  
Skin L mid-thoracic: healed hyperpigmented patch only, no active vesicles, no erythema/warmth, not tender  
Neuro grossly NAD  

A:  
1) Herpes zoster L thoracic – resolved, mild residual neuropathic sx only, no e/o PHN yet  
2) HIV infection – stable by hx, immunocompromised, f/up tertiary clinic  

P:  
- No repeat valaciclovir – no active infection, no indication for suppressive Rx  
- Analgesia PRN only (paracetamol up to 4g/day discussed)  
- If pain persists/worsens esp >3/12 → consider PHN Rx (lidocaine patch / gabapentin)  
- Asked to bring last HIV clinic letter/viral load/CD4 next visit  
- Needs longer appt (20–30min) in next 1–2/12 for HIV + vax review (incl zoster vax timing), gen prev care & bloods  
- No tests today – clinically well, zoster healed  
- Red flags explained: facial/eye rash, fever, severe pain, neuro sx → urgent review/ED  
- RTC earlier if any new rash or systemic sx  

No scripts given today – rationale discussed, pt initially unhappy but accepts plan.
