32F – “quick check” rash  

PC: “large blisters that popped & now stinging” trunk/thighs. Only wants brief review, needs to get back to childcare.  

HPC: 3–4/7 rapid onset large thin-walled blisters lower abdo/groin/prox thighs → ruptured → red raw patches. Mildly tender + itchy. No fevers documented, felt “a bit hot” last night. No N/V, no rigors, no jt pain.  
Hx eczema. Recent scabies & tinea Rx OTC – mostly settled per pt. Using Dettol baths + bandaids.  

OE (limited – pt declined full skin check):  
Afeb 36.9 HR 86 BP 114/72 RR 14 SpO₂ 99% RA  
Lower abdo/prox thighs: ~8–10 superficial erosions 0.5–2cm, erythematous, some collarette scale, light honey crust edges, mild surrounding erythema, no ↑warmth, no induration, no fluctuance. No intact bullae now but phone photo 2/7 ago shows large flaccid clear-yellow bullae same sites → c/w bullous impetigo. Background mild eczematous change waistband. Feet: mild interdigital scale only.  

No systemic red flags on brief exam.  

A:  
1) Bullous impetigo – likely staph, multiple lesions, extensive → oral abx indicated.  
2) Underlying dermatitis (atopic/irritant) – barrier issue, not main focus today.  
3) Hx scabies/tinea – ?ongoing low-grade itch but no clear active burrows today.  

P:  
- Start flucloxacillin 500mg PO QID x5/7 (ok to cease after ≥3/7 if clearly improving, no new lesions) – pt has tolerated penicillins prev.  
- Topical: simple non-soap wash, soften crusts with Vaseline, non-adherent dressings to weepy areas.  
- Work: no childcare work until ≥24hrs after starting abx & lesions covered → med cert provided.  
- Swab offered – declined (time). Plan swab / change abx if poor response.  
- RTC/ED if fever, feels very unwell, rapidly spreading erythema, ↑pain, pus, or no improvement 48–72hrs.  

Dermatitis etc:  
- Suggested regular emollient, avoid Dettol baths.  
- Pt requested “cream” today – deferred steroid/antifungal choice to longer appt.  

Ix: none ordered today (acute straightforward impetigo, systemically well).  

F/up:  
- Review 3–5/7 if not clearly improving or sooner if worse.  
- Book long appt (20min) in 1–2/52 AM before work for full skin review (eczema, tinea, ?scabies, prevention).  

10:01 – running late, rest to be done next visit.
