72M, Anglo-Aus, retired electirican  

Reason for visit  
F/up “strokes” + Parkinsons – wants to “sort out what’s going on with these strokes”, short appt only.  

HPC  
Known Parkinsons dx ~5 yrs ago (neuro Newcastle, good levodopa respones per old letter – scanned 2020? 2021?). Over last ~18 mths reports step-wise drops in function, told “mini strokes”:

- ~18 mths: sudden worse shuffle + balance over a day, never back to old baseline, had ED obs o/night in Newcastle, ?CT brain – no report in file today.  
- ~9 mths: few mins slurred speech + R hand “not doing what I wanted”, self resolved, no ED.  
- ~3 mths: woke with R leg weaker, needed walker ~1 wk, now better but still not baseline.  

Today no acute FAST sxs. More gait difficulty, freezing in doorways, 2x falls last 6 wks, no head strike, no LOC. No CP, palps, SOB. Pt thinks maybe “standing up too quick” / “new mattress twisting my back cutting off blood to brain”.  

Wife (on phone on speaker for part of consult) says he is “definatly slower and more wobbly” over last year, more forgetful but still paying bills etc.  

PMHx (relevent only)  
- Parkinson disease ~5 yrs  
- ?TIA/CVA x several – details unclear, likely cerebrovasc disease  
- Chronic constipation  

Meds  
- Levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 TDS (07:00, 11:00, 17:00)  
- Docusate/senna PRN  

No antiplatelet, anticoag, statin or BP tab documented prior. NKDA.  

Obs (today)  
BP 148/84 sitting, 132/78 standing 3 mins (mild postural drop, asymptomatic)  
HR 76 reg, RR 16, afebrile, SpO2 97% RA, BMI ~25  

Exam (focused)  
Neuro: alert, orientated. Speech clear. Face symetrical. Mild bilat bradykinesia, cogwheel L>R, resting tremor L hand. Power 5/5 all limbs, no obvious acute focal defecit. Shuffling gait, reduced arm swing L, turns en bloc, mild postural instability but recovers. FAST neg.  
CVS: HS dual, no murmur, no irreg.  
Rest not examined in detail – time.  

Impression  
1. Probable cerebrovascular disease with hx of TIAs / small strokes, step-wise decline in pt with Parkinsons. No acute stroke today. Needs secondary prevention.  
2. Parkinson disease – moderate, wearing-off, falls, ?mixed picture vs vascular parkinsonism given stepwise hx.  
3. Vascular risk factors incompletly worked up – mild HTN, unknown lipids/DM.  
4. Constipation – chronic, Parkinson + inactivity + diet.  

Plan  

Cerebrovasc / “strokes”  
- Commenced secondary prevention today:  
  • Aspirin 100mg mane (PBS genric, new script).  
  • Atorvastatin 40mg nocte (start low-ish high intensity; discussed muscle aches/LFTs).  
- Bloods ordered: FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, HbA1c, fasting glucose, TFT.  
- ECG requested with nurse today if time (screen AF). If not done, do at next review.  
- Imaging: req for MRI brain (incl small vessel disease, basal ganglia) – if MRI not available then CT brain + CT angiogram neck/head (radiology request sent).  
- Carotid Doppler U/S ordered.  
- ED if any new FAST sxs, sudden severe headache, acute visual loss, collapse etc.  

Parkinsons  
- Continue levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 TDS for now – no dose change today due to dx uncertanty and stroke risk workup pending.  
- Referral back to Neurology / movement disorder clinic Newcastle: review dx idiopathic PD vs vascular parkinsonism / mixed, optimise regime (consider more frequent dosing / MR preps), assess cognition + falls.  
- Suggested physio for gait/balance & falls prevention – to be done under CDM; needs longer appt for care plan (pt says “no time today”).  

BP / risk  
- Mildly high BP today. Will repeat next visit + consider home BPs or 24hr ABP.  
- Consider start ACEi (eg perindopril) once serial BPs + bloods back.  

Constipation  
- Briefly advised ↑fibre + fluids, more walking.  
- Offered macrogol regularly instead of just PRN stimulant – pt wants to “try food first”, will review.  

Driving / safety  
- Still driving short local trips. Advised not to drive with any new neuro sxs or if feels “off”. Will revist after neuro opinion + imaging. Wife agrees to monitor.  

Follow up  
- Std review 1–2 wks: check bloods, ECG (if done), BPs, tolerence of aspirin/statin, chase imaging.  
- Longer appt later for CDM/physio and to go over other issues (sleep, bladder, mood – only briefly mentioned today).  

Time  
Booked std, ran ~15 mins. Pt kept saying “need to go get the grandkids” so some things deferred. Old neuro letters partly reviewed – some dates in file 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – will recheck next visit.
