# Impression  
1 PD suboptimally controlled due to poor adherence to levodopa/carbidopa motor sx ↑ but nil acute red flags today  
2 Psychosis 2° PD chronic mild insight preserved likely fluctuates w "off" periods currently non distressing to pt more concerning to wife  
3 Constipation chronic multifactorial PD + diet + ↓ activity  
4 ED longstanding not addressed today  
5 Non adherence missed appts high risk for motor decline falls psych issues needs simple regimen wife support  

# Plan today  
PD / meds  
- Restart regular levodopa/carbidopa 100/25mg 1 tab TDS eg 08:00 12:00 16:00 w food if nausea  
- PBS script 1/12 supply + 2 repeats provided  
- Discussed importance of strict timing explained irregular dosing can worsen stiffness tremor haluc  
- Suggested weekly pill box + phone alarms involve wife to supervise meds  

Psychosis  
- Given stable insight non threatening content and current med instability will not start antipsychotic today  
- Documented to avoid typical APs and SGAs that worsen PD eg haloperidol risperidone olanzapine  
- Plan reassess freq/distress of haluc once on steady levodopa 2–4/52 may need neuro/psychogeriatrician input ± quetiapine vs clozapine later  

Constipation  
- Start macrogol 3350 eg Movicol 1 sachet daily titrate to effect script given  
- Brief diet advice ↑ fibre fluids gentle walking advised to minimise colon cleanse products  

ED  
- Acknowledged not priority today offered longer appt later pt says can live with it ok to defer  

Adherence / systems  
- Flagged in EMR as at risk of non attendance  
- Spoke briefly w wife on speaker she agrees to help with reminders and supervise dosing  
- Offered practice nurse chronic disease r/v PD focused meds schedule falls risk constipation etc pt agreed if not too early in morning nurse appt request sent  

Referrals  
- Re-referral to movement disorders neurology clinic sent via HealthLink for stage r/v med optimisation psychosis mgmt noted prev non attendance asked wife to help ensure he goes  

# Safety net  
- Advise ED or urgent GP if sudden severe ↓ mobility new fall or head injury new confusion acute change in speech vision weakness marked ↑ haluc or behaviour change severe abdo pain PR bleed vomiting or wt loss  
- If milder ↑ stiffness tremor haluc or constipation not settling book earlier GP r/v  

# F/U  
- F/U w regular GP Dr Smith in 2–4/52 booked before leaving to  
  - check adherence and response to levodopa/carbidopa  
  - r/v haluc freq/distress  
  - r/v constipation on macrogol
