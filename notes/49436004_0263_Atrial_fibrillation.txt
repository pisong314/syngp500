A  
1 Mechanical LBP likely flare of chronic lumbar spondylosis / OA 2° posture mattress/chair ergonomics  
   - No features of cauda equina spinal infection fracture malignancy or retroperitoneal bleed at present  
2 Persistent NVAF clinically stable on rate control + apixaban  
3 COPD stable no current exacerbation  
4 Elderly pt on DOAC polypharmacy needs renal fxn monitoring for safe dosing  

P  

#1 Mechanical low back pain  
- Education re likely mechanical cause reassured not cardiac / DOAC related on todays findings  
- Safety net: advise pt + staff to report immediately if new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia bowel/bladder change severe sudden back pain or systemic sx  
- Analgesia  
  - Change Panadol regimen → paracetamol 1g TDS regular for 5–7/7 then reassess max 4g/d keep PRN charted but nursing to avoid >4g total  
  - Continue to avoid NSAIDs given age AF DOAC COPD HTN  
- Non pharm  
  - Nursing staff to encourage short frequent walks w 4WW vs prolonged sitting in soft lounge chair  
  - Simple lumbar flexion stretches within comfort verbal advice  
  - Req RACF to check mattress firmness seating ergonomics consider firmer overlay if avail  
- Ix  
  - Nil immediate imaging indicated in absence of red flags  
  - If pain persists >4–6/52 or worsens or red flags → consider LS spine XR ± further w/u  

#2 AF – persistent NVAF  
- Stroke risk high CHA₂DS₂‑VASc ≥4 age HTN etc anticoagulation appropriate  
- Rate controlled haemodynamically stable nil change to metoprolol or apixaban today  
- Ix ordered via RACF pathology  
  - FBC U&E eGFR LFT TSH INR (baseline only despite DOAC)  
- Counselled re bleeding risk vs stroke prevention pt asked “should I be worried about these side effects” discussed signs of bleeding melena haematuria large bruises sudden severe back or abdo pain instructed to alert staff/GP/hosp if occurs  

#3 COPD  
- Clinically stable continue tiotropium bud/formoterol salbutamol PRN  
- Asked about “getting a bit more puffed on really hot days” explained expected w COPD and heat staff to monitor  
- Plan dedicated COPD r/v next visit to check vax (flu pneumo COVID) action plan spirometry hx  

#4 Meds / monitoring  
- Med change today  
  - Paracetamol 1g BD → 1g TDS regular short term as above  
- Check renal fxn with ordered bloods to confirm ongoing safe apixaban dose adjust if eGFR ↓  

Communication / follow up  
- Nursing staff informed of back pain plan paracetamol dose change mobilisation advice physio r/f and red flag monitoring  
- Physio r/f requested for back pain exercises + bed/chair assessment  
- Pathology form left for routine bloods in next 7–10/7  
- Plan GP r/v next RACF round ~1–2/52 or earlier if  
  - Back pain ↑ significantly or any red flag  
  - New AF sx CP palps syncope bleeding sx  
  - Resp status deteriorates
