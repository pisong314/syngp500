22/11/25 10:05 home visit – f/up CVD / “just a blood test”

82yo male, known IHD (old NSTEMI ~5–6 yrs ago, medically managed per old discharge). Retired, housebound, wife main informant.

C/o “bit more tired, bit more puffed walking up the hallway” x ~2–3/12. Thinks “probably nothing, maybe that cheap instant coffee”. Wants “a blood test to see if everything’s alright”.

No chest pain, no chest tightness, no radiation, no acute SOB. No PND/orthopnoea (1 pillow). Mild ankle swelling PM, better AM; wife thinks worse last month. 2x brief light‑headed on standing over last 2/52, seconds only, no fall/syncope. No palps, focal neuro sx, speech/vision changes. Appetite slightly ↓ but clothes fit, bowels/bladder ok, no fevers or cough.

Known HTN, IHD. No known DM, CKD. No anticoagulant.

Meds found on kitchen table/Webster:
- Aspirin 100 mg mane
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte (admits missing “a couple of times a week”)
- Perindopril 5 mg mane
- Metoprolol succinate 47.5 mg mane
- GTN spray PRN (not used >12/12)
- PRN paracetamol

Says sometimes skips morning tabs if “staying in the recliner all day”. Wife nags re adherence.

Ex (brief, relevant):
Elderly, thin, in recliner, comfortable, talking in full sentences.
BP 132/68 sitting → 118/64 standing (1 min, “slightly woozy” but steady). HR 64 reg, RR 16, SpO₂ 97% RA, T 36.6.
CVS: S1S2, no obvious murmur, JVP not raised. Mild bilat pitting oedema ankles to mid‑shin.
Chest clear, no crackles/wheeze.
Neuro grossly non‑focal, mobilises short distance with stick, slow but steady.

IMP:
1) IHD – secondary prevention, very high risk. No current red flag ACS or acute decomp HF. Mild ↑fatigue + ankle oedema, likely multifactorial (age, venous, ?early HF, deconditioning).
2) Postural symptoms – mild orthostatic drop, ?meds + age + relative dehydration.
3) Fatigue – r/o anaemia, thyroid, renal, DM, etc. Needs updated bloods (none >18/12).

PLAN:
- Meds:
  - Continue aspirin 100 mg mane.
  - Atorvastatin: ↑ adherence rather than dose change for now. Switched to generic “atorvastatin 40 mg” script (PBS) as he prefers “whatever’s cheapest” – counselled must be daily even if feeling well.
  - Perindopril 5 mg mane – continue.
  - Metoprolol succinate 47.5 mg mane – continue, monitor postural sx.
  - No new HF meds today – avoid complicating until bloods back and see trend.
  - Asked wife to keep Webster next to recliner; both agree to “try not to skip”.

- Ix (home collection – local community pathology, forms given to wife):
  - FBC
  - UEC, eGFR, LFT
  - Lipids
  - HbA1c, fasting glucose (if practical, otherwise random ok)
  - TSH
  - UACR – urine pot left, path to collect with bloods
Results to be faxed/HealthLink to practice – mark as “GP to phone pt/wife”.

- Brief advice: small regular walks in house as tolerated, elevate legs when sitting. Limit coffee to a few cups/day, reassured tap water/instant coffee very unlikely cause. No med changes re BP today as BP acceptable and sx mild.

Red flags explained (wife mainly):
- Call 000 or ED if chest pain/pressure, marked SOB esp lying flat, new neuro deficits, collapse/faint.
She verbalised understanding.

Follow‑up:
- Await bloods (3–5 days). Plan phone review with wife + pt when results back (within 1–2 wks). Likely further home visit after that to review CVD management, consider echo / cardiology vs conservative depending on results and goals of care.
- Longer visit later for falls risk, vaccines, ACP, possible My Aged Care referral – deferred today due to time.
