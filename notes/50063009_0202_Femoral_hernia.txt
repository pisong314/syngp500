Telehealth – phone (pt at home, GP in rooms). ID confrimed x3.  

CC:  
“Feeling really down and scared somthing serious is going on”

HPC:  
72 yr old F, known to practice with long hx health worries.  
3–4 wks low mood, “flat and teary”, poor slep (early waking), ↓ appettie but still 2 meals/day, low enegy but still managign housework. Anhednoia, stopped seniors exercsie group as “keep thinking something bad will happen”.  
Main worry = R groin lump. CT in ED ~3 mths ago – small R femoral hernia, reducible, non‑obstruc (per prev notes). Has gen surg OPD booked ~6 wks.  

Now: mild intermitant R groin discomfort only, worse standing, settles w rest. Lump still reducible lying down. No sev abdo pain, no constnat pain, no distension, N/V, bowels OK, passing wind, no PR bleed, no fevers.  

Marked health anx. Googling femoral hernia, fixated on strangulaton/cancer – repeatedly asking “are you sure they havn’t missed cancer / should we do more tests before it’s too late”. Checks and pokes area multiple times/day, which ↑ ache.  

Mood symps mostly around health. No panic attacks but “heart racing” when reading online. No CP, SOB, presyncope.  
Denies SI/SH: “I don’t want to die, I’m just scared I might”. Future‑focussed (talks about Xmas, seeing grandkids, surg appt).  

PMHx:  
- R femoral hernia – small, reducible (CT ED ~3/12 ago).  
- No formal psych dx, prev brief grief reaction after husband died ~10 yrs ago, no meds.

Exam (phone – limited):  
Speaking in full sentnces, no audible SOB.  
Thoughts coherrent, speech normal. Mood “worried and low”, affect congruent, slight tremor in voice. No cog concerns in convo. No red flag GI or systemic symps by hx.  

Impresson:  
1) Health‑related anx / health anx d/o with situational depressive symps. No current suicidality.  
2) Known R femoral hernia – sounds uncomplicated today (mild intermitant discomfort only, reducible, no obstructive/systemic features).  

Plan:  

Mental health:  
- Discussed link betwen “Dr Google”, health anx and low mood.  
- Brief intro to CBT ideas.  
- Pt keen to try talking therapry first, declines meds for now (will reconsider if worsens / fxn declines).  
- Arrange F2F 30 min in 1–2 wks for Mental Health Treatment Plan + baseline K10/DASS‑21 and referral to psych (focus on health anx).  

Hernia / safety net:  
- Reassured re prior CT + ED assess – no e/o malignncy, explained hernia structural not cancer.  
- Red flag advice for urgent ED: sudden sev groin/abdo pain, irreducible hard tender lump, N/V, abdo distension, unable to pass wind/open bowels, fevers/feeling very unwell. Pt states understands.  
- Advised avoid repetetive poking at area.  
- Confirmed surg OPD appt still booked; will reviw again after she sees surgeon if needed.  

Ix:  
- No urgent tests today – clinically no red flag features.  
- Plan basic screen next F2F if symps persit: FBC, UEC, LFT, TSH, B12/fol, fasting BSL/lipids (SN/QML form to be given then).  

Follow‑up:  
- Book 30 min F2F within 1–2 wks for MHTP + review mood/anx + hernia symps.  
- Sooner appt if mood worsens or fxn drops.  
- ED if acute hernia/abdo red flags as above.  

Time:  
~14 min phone – mainly health anx/low mood + hernia safety‑net.
