22/11/25 10:34 Telehealth video (metro → pt in rural). Video dropouts x2

72F “check up” but main issue cough. Limited English – daughter on screen translating. Anglo background but CALD, nods a lot, ?understanding

HPC
~7–10d cough. Started dry → now productive small amt yellow sputum. No haemoptysis. Chest “sore from coughing” only  
Mild SOB on exertion only (“little puff walking to kitchen”), none at rest. No pleuritic CP  
Had low‑grade fevers first 3–4d, now afebrile per daughter. Appetite ↓ a bit, fluids ok  
Mild coryza early, now settled. No sore throat, no sinus pain  
Daughter denies confusion, ankle swelling, orthopnoea, PND. No report of tachypnoea at rest  
No known COVID contact, RAT -ve 3d ago. No recent travel/procedures. Non-smoker (quit >30y, light). No known COPD/asthma/bronchiectasis

PMHx
Not fully explored today (time/lang). Pt/daughter deny known heart/lung disease, DM, stroke

Meds
PRN paracetamol 500 mg, OTC cough mix  
No reg meds. NKDA

O/E (video only)
Elderly F, looks tired but NAD, speaking full sentences. RR ~18–20, no obvious accessory muscle use, no cyanosis. Occasional loose cough. No vitals (no home BP/SaO2)

Daughter: “worried chest infection but she ok sitting”. Pt: “maybe cold air from window”

Impression
1) LRTI – likely acute bronchitis, uncomplicated. Clinically stable, low suspicion pneumonia but cannot fully r/o w/o exam  
2) “General health check” – deferred, needs longer appt + interpreter

Plan
– No abx – likely viral, no red flags on TH today  
– Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/d) for discomfort/fever  
– Continue warm fluids / honey etc if helpful  
– No scripts changed/added; consider SABA trial or abx if worsens at F/U or F2F exam

Safety net
– ED/000 if SOB at rest, pleuritic CP, high fevers/rigors, confusion, haemoptysis, blue lips/face, marked deterioration  
– If not improving or worse 48–72h → see local GP F2F for exam, vitals, ?CXR, ?viral swab

Ix
None today (telehealth, low risk, rural). Local GP to organise obs + CXR if concern

Gen health
Brief only – ex‑smoker, denies major chronic dz. Explained proper health check needs 20–30 min + TIS interpreter. Pt says “son help next time”

Plan F/U
– TH or local GP review 5–7d if not improving; earlier if any concerns  
– Book longer appt later for full health assessment + prevention when acute settled, with daughter/son + interpreter

11:02 addendum: noted again – needs interpreter flagged in file, avoid relying solely on family for complex discussions
