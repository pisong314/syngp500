S  
72 yr Anglo-Aust male retired factory worker  
Known COPD asthma overlap ex smoker 40+ pack yrs stopped ~10 yrs ago  
R/v 5 days ago dx LRTI on background COPD given Augmentin Duo Forte 875/125 bd + pred 25mg mane 5/7  

Today  
Still SOB at rest  
Says breathing faster even sitting watching TV more aware of RR  
Cough still productive yellow sputum ↓vol vs earlier in week nil haemoptysis  
Wheeze chest tight esp nocte using salbutamol puffer 3–4x/day with some relief  
Finished first pred course this morning says has taken all meds as directed nil missed doses  

Systemic  
Felt hot/cold first 2/7 nil fevers last 48h  
Nil rigors nil confusion nil pleuritic CP  
Appetite ↓ drinking ok  
Nil ankle swelling weight subjectively stable  
Nil orthopnoea nil PND  

Wife noticed ↑RR at rest encouraged review  
Pt asking if should be worried still “so puffed even after the tablets”  

Thinks fan on at night maybe making chest worse  
Stopped usual short walks “so I wouldn’t make the infection worse” now feels more breathless  

Meds (per EMR confirmed)  
Tiotropium/olodaterol daily  
Budesonide/formoterol 200/6 bd  
Salbutamol MDI prn  
Salbutamol neb prn at home used twice this week  
Paracetamol prn  
NKDA  

Lives with wife independent ADLs drives nil current smoking ETOH minimal  

O  
Gen elderly male sitting upright speaking full sentences mild SOB at rest looks tired not toxic AOx3  

Obs  
BP 132/76  
HR 96 reg  
RR 24–26  
Temp 37.4  
SpO2 93% RA (baseline 94–95 in notes 2024)

Chest expansion sl ↓ but symm  
Percussion resonant  
Ausc: widespread exp wheeze bilat coarse crackles + rhonchi R mid lower zones partly clear with cough nil focal bronchial breath sounds nil pleural rub  

CVS dual HS nil added sounds nil oedema JVP not ↑  

No obvious red flag for severe pneumonia sepsis or CCF today  

A  
1 LRTI on background COPD asthma overlap partial response to 5/7 Augmentin persistent tachypnoea wheeze no clear focal consolidation ?early pneumonia vs ongoing bronchitis vs COPD exacerbation  
2 COPD with asthma overlap mild acute exacerbation 2° infection sats borderline but stable speaking full sentences  
3 Tachypnoea at rest – concerning but currently haemodynamically stable nil sepsis features  

P  
LRTI / COPD exacerbation  
– Continue Augmentin Duo Forte to complete 7/7 total  
– Restart pred 25mg mane further 3/7 then cease discussed short course SEs sleep mood BGL advised mane with food report any black stools or major mood change  
– Salbutamol MDI 2–4 puffs q4h prn via spacer prefer puffer routine reserve neb if puffer not helping if needing neb repeatedly → urgent review / ED  
– Continue usual tiotropium/olodaterol + bud/formoterol  

Non pharm  
Encourage gentle mobilisation short indoor walks avoid full rest  
Sleep with HOB ↑ can turn fan away from face if bothers him explained fan unlikely main cause  

Ix  
– CXR PA/lat ordered today QML to exclude pneumonia or complication  
– FBC CRP UEC LFT ordered SN path to assess inflammatory markers and baseline biochem  
– Nasopharyngeal swab resp viral PCR incl influenza COVID ordered  

Results pending will adjust abx / consider hospital r/v if CXR or bloods concerning  

Safety net  
Standard resp safety net given  
Pt advised to attend ED / call 000 if  
– SOB ↑ esp if unable to speak full sentences  
– SpO2 <90% if checked at home  
– Fever >38.5 rigors  
– New CP confusion or sudden marked ↓exercise tolerance over hrs  

Wife present appears capable both verbalise understanding  

Follow up  
– F/U 48h standard consult to reassess RR SpO2 WOB chest signs r/v CXR + bloods  
– Earlier r/v or ED if any deterioration as above  

Chronic COPD care  
COPD asthma action plan due for update will book long appt with PN + GP in ~2–3/52 for full review spirometry vacc status (flu pneumo COVID) etc  

Pt summary  
Pt engaged asks appropriate Q re cause of ↑RR and need for more steroids abx  
Repeats back plan “finish antibiotics take extra 3 days of steroids come back in two days go to hospital if I get a lot more puffed” appears reliable with meds and f/u  

[Addendum 16:30 – Dr K Lee  
Path and CXR not yet available in Best Practice will r/v results next appt and call earlier if any abnormals]
