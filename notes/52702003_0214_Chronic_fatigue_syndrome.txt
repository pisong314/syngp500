ME/CFS: baseline fluctuating fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, “brain fog”  
Last 2–3/52 feels worse even pre-URTI “just can’t bounce back from anything”  
Sleep poor – takes 1–2h to get off, wakes unrefreshed  
Non-adherent: stopped melatonin “ran out a few weeks ago”, missed last 2 CFS nurse appts, never booked psych (“didn’t get around to it”), no diary, pacing erratic – overdoes on good days then “crashes for days”

A  
1) Acute viral URTI on background ME/CFS  
   – No red flags for pneumonia, bacterial sinusitis, strep throat  
2) ME/CFS – established, currently suboptimally controlled, adherence issues  
3) Behavioural/adherence barriers (forgetful/overwhelmed, frequent DNAs)  

P  
URTI  
– Reassure viral, no ABx  
– Paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day)  
– Nasal saline spray PRN; consider INCS if congestion >1/52  
– Honey/simple linctus nocte for cough  
– Red flags given: SOB, pleuritic CP, T >38.5 >48h, confusion, neck stiffness, any deterioration → ED/RTC  

ME/CFS / sleep  
– Time limited today – brief only, needs longer review  
– Restart melatonin: Melatonin MR 2 mg nocte 1–2h pre-bed. Suggested putting pack by toothbrush/bed as cue  
– Simple sleep hygiene focus: fixed wake time; no screens in bed x 30 mins pre-sleep (already has handout)  
– Pacing: explained “energy budget” keep activity steady, avoid boom–bust; asked to jot 3–4 word daily note in phone re activity/crash days instead of full diary  

Adherence  
– Suggested phone calendar reminders for meds/appts  
– Encouraged involve partner as reminder – pt agreeable “I’ll try, I just get too tired to think about it”

– Plan next review: FBC UEC LFT TFT ferritin CRP (last >12/12 ago)  

F/up  
– Booked long f/up 2–3/52 (20–30 min) for structured ME/CFS review, sleep, pacing, bloods, mental health screen as needed + check URTI resolved
