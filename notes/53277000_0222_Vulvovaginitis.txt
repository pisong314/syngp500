A  
1 Vulvovaginitis likely uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis partial response to short topical azole  
   Persistent external itch with improved discharge → likely residual inflam / irritant dermatitis rather than tx failure  
   RFs tight synthetic clothing daily panty liners perfumed body wash  
2 Threadworm infection ?enterobius – unlikely  
   No classic nocturnal perianal itch on waking nil worms seen nil GI sx adult pt  
   Pt still somewhat preoccupied re “worms”  

P  
1 Candida vulvovaginitis / vulval irritation  
   - Fluconazole 150mg PO stat today single dose pt prefers oral one off  
     May repeat 150mg in 3/7 if minimal improvement advised not >2 doses without GP r/v  
   - Hydrocortisone 1% ointment thin layer externally to vulva BD up to 5–7/7 avoid internal use  
   - Advice brief  
       • Avoid perfumed soaps body washes wipes bubble bath use non fragranced wash or water only  
       • Loose cotton underwear avoid tight leggings where possible change out of damp clothes  
       • ↓ or stop daily panty liners if can non scented if needed  
       • Avoid scratching pat dry after shower  
   - Mentioned topical creams can weaken condoms advised care if using  

2 ?Threadworm  
   - Explained typical sx nocturnal perianal itch esp in kids why current picture not suggestive  
   - No empirical mebendazole given clinical suspicion low  
   - If develops classic perianal nocturnal itch or worms seen can try OTC mebendazole single dose repeat 2/52 and treat close contacts advised GP r/v if unsure
