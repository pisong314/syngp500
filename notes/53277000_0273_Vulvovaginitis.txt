2) Suspected candida vulvovaginitis on background recurrent thrush + T2DM + irritants. No features PID/STI/BV  
3) T2DM – suboptimal control likely, contributing to recurrent thrush / skin issues  
4) Dermatitis hx – poss irritant component vulval. Threadworm quiescent

P:  
HA  
- Reassure re low concern for acute neuro event today  
- Paracetamol PRN, max 4 g/24h  
- Adv reg meals, ↓ caffeine, breaks from screen etc (brief)  
- Red flags explained – attend ED/000 if sudden severe “worst ever” HA, focal neuro, vision/speech change, confusion, fever/neck stiff, vomiting, trauma  
- If persisting >1/52 or ↑ freq → F2F for BP + neuro exam ± imaging/eye review

Vulvovaginitis  
- Likely candidal (non-severe) in setting DM + irritants. Reassured not STI  
- Pt prefers tablet “the cream is messy, the tablet’s easier”  
→ Fluconazole 150 mg PO stat (PBS)  
→ Hydrocortisone 1% ointment ext vulva BD PRN up to 5–7/7 (not internal)  
→ Soap substitute (e.g. sorbolene), avoid perfumed washes/wipes, ↓ daily liners, loose cotton underwear (briefly discussed)  
- Partner treat only if symptomatic – will need own review  
- Needs F2F 1–2/52 for vulval exam + HVS MCS to confirm candida / r/o BV, derm conditions if ongoing. If ≥4/yr consider long-term regimen / gynae or derm referral

DM  
- Discussed link poor control ↔ recurrent thrush. Pt keen to “get back on top of my sugars”  
- Continue metformin + gliclazide as prescribed (dose to confirm F2F)  
- Warned fluconazole may ↑ sulfonylurea levels → watch for hypo (sweats, shakes, dizzy, confusion). Adv reg meals. Pt verbalises understanding  
- F2F 1–2/52 (20 min) for DM review: BP, wt, feet; bloods: HbA1c, FBG/lipids, U&E, LFT, urine ACR; review meds, diet, poss diabetes educator

F/up / safety net  
- Book F2F 1–2/52 for vulval exam + DM review + bloods  
- RTC earlier / ED if HA red flags, vulval pain severe, spreading erythema, fever / systemically unwell, abn vag bleeding  

Pt engaged, asking “Should I be worried about these headaches?” – reassured but safety net given. Agrees with plan.
