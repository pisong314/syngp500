29F, works in hospital admin.  

Presenting  
“Genral health check” + 4–5 days “shocking cold/flu”, asking for abx and CXR “to be safe”.  

HPC  
4–5 days sore throat (burning first 2 days, now better), blocked nose, rhinorhoea, dry then now mildy productive cough.  
Subjective fevers/chills first 2 nights, none since, no temp taken.  
Mild frontal HA, myalgias early, now settling.  
No SOB, no pleuritic CP, no wheeze, no haemoptysis. Eating/drinking ok.  
RAT day 2 neg, no known COVID contacts. Work collegues with “colds going around”.  

Very keen on abx: “my usual dr always gives me antibitoics and it knocks it on the head… I can’t be sick, I work at a hospital”. Mildly frustratd when advised likley viral.  

No signif PMHx. No regular meds. NKDA. Non-smoker. ETOH modest. Missed flu vax this year.  

Examination  
Looks well, talking in full sentances, mild nasal congestion.  
Obs: BP 118/74, HR 88 reg, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA, T 36.9.  
ENT: mild pharyngeal erythema, no exudate, no tonsillar swellling, TMs normal, mild clear nasal d/c, small mobile ant cerv nodes only.  
Resp: chest clear, good AE, no wheeze/crackles/bronchial sounds. No use of acc muscles.  
CVS: HS dual, no m.  

Impression  
1) URTI – likely uncomplicated viral. No red flags, obs normal, chest clear, short duration and already improving. No features for PNA, sepsis or pertussis. No indication for abx or CXR.  
2) Preventive care – generally well 29F, due for routine screenign and immunisn review but not done fully today (time, acute issue).  

Plan  
– Explained likley viral URTI, expected course ~7–10 days, cough may last longer.  
– Discussed why no antibitoics: no evidence bacterial infection, risks > benefit. Pt not happy initially but agreed to trial sx tx.  
Meds:  
• Paracetamol 1g PO q6h PRN (max 4g/day).  
• Ibuprofen 400mg PO tds PRN with food for throat/myalgia (avoid if abdo upset).  
• Saline nasal spray PRN.  
• Can try non-sedating antihistamine eg cetirizine 10mg mane for congestion/post-nasal drip.  
• Honey/lozenges/simple linctus PRN cough.  

No abxs. No CXR. No bloods – results unlikely to change managment today.  

Preventive (brief only)  
– BP ok, weight looks in healthy range (BMI to do next visit).  
– Rec annual flu vax esp as works in hospital – to book with nurse once better.  
– Brief diet/exercise chat; reassured coffee x3/day not causing “weak immune system”.  

Follow up / safety net  
RTC / urgent review if SOB, CP, high fevers >3–4 more days, confusion, neck stiffness, much worse cough or persists >4 weeks.  
Book longer “health check” appt in 4–6/52 for full preventive review (lipids, glucose, cervical screen status, immunisns etc).  

[Addendum 22/11/25 16:10 – JS]  
Pt rang reception asking again if “stronger antibiotics” could be sent to chemist so she can be “right for work Monday”. Reiterated via phone no abx indication based on today’s exam; advised continue sx care and RTC if deteriorates. Pt verbalised understanding, still dissapointed.
