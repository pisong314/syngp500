CC: neck + R arm pain – wants rpt pain meds  

Hx: known C6/7 radiculopathy + mild cervical myelopathy (MRI proven lat disc). Flare x3–4/52. Sharp shooting pain R neck→shoulder→lat arm→thumb/index. Worse at night + overhead work. OTC ibuprofen “when I remember”. Ran out of previous meds, poor adherence. Did not attend neurosurg f/up, no physio done. No trauma.  

Red flags:  
- Weakness: mild “clumsy” R hand but no clear change vs baseline  
- Gait: nil unsteady, no falls  
- Sensory: no saddle anaesthesia  
- Bladder/bowel: no incontinence/retention  
- Sys: no wt loss, fevers, night sweats  

Ex: appears uncomfortable  
Neck ↓ROM ext + R rot (pain)  
UL neuro: R wrist + elbow ext 4+/5, rest 5/5. ↓LT/pin over R C6–7 (lat forearm, thumb/index). R biceps/triceps reflex ↓, L N. Hoffmann –ve. Gait N. No new myelopathy signs.  

Dx:  
1) C6/7 cervical radiculopathy 2° lat disc – flare, neuro signs similar to prev  
2) Known mild cervical myelopathy – clinically stable today  
3) Poor adherence to meds + specialist f/up  

Plan:  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN (adv reg for 1–2/52) – script: Panadol 500 mg, 2 tabs q6h PRN, max 8/d, qty 100, rpt ×1 (PBS gen)  
  • Naproxen 500 mg PO BD wf 5–7/7 then PRN – script: Naproxen 500 mg, qty 30, no rpt. Avoid other NSAIDs.  
  • No pred today – concern re adherence, neuro stable. Review option at f/up if still severe.  
  • Avoid cervical manipulation (chiro) – risk given myelopathy.  

– Physio: re‑referral sent (cervical radiculopathy program, stabilisation + neural glides).  

– Neurosurg: re‑refer public clinic for review of known myelopathy + persistent radic. Emphasised risk if progression.  

– Ix: bloods for NSAID safety/age – FBC, U&E, eGFR, LFT, CRP (form given, suggested today).  

– Adherence: discussed phone alarms, reg dosing, limited repeats, needs review before further scripts.  

Safety net: ED if ↑weakness/numbness, unsteady gait/falls, bowel/bladder change, new electric shock sensation, rapid deterioration.  

F/up: 2/52 long appt booked – review pain, function, adherence, consider steroids/repeat MRI if worsening. Earlier PRN.
