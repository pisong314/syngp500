32M intl student – 1st visit  

CC: TB review – smear +ve sputum, on tx via hosp TB clinic  

HPI:  
Dx pulm TB last wk via resp clinic (after 3–4/12 cough). Pt very tangential, hard to pin down. Says “they told me the sputum was positive, TB for sure” and “my cough is a bit less since the tablets”.  
Cough ~4/12, now productive yellow sputum, no haemoptysis. Had fevers/night sweats + wt loss (“belt another notch”) pre‑dx. No pleuritic CP, no sig SOB at rest, “only puffed if I run for the bus”.  
On TB meds x 6 days – “four tablets once a day, the orange one makes my wee orange”. Likely HRZE. Missed 1 AM dose y/day (took PM instead), otherwise compliant. Mild nausea if empty stomach, no vomiting, abdo pain, dark urine, jaundice, visual change, paraesthesia.  
Today: still coughing but ↓, no fever today (“felt hot 2 nights ago”), tired, appetite a bit better. No headache, confusion, neck stiffness, urinary sx, joint or back pain. Worried about work/visa – “housemates will kick me out if they know it’s TB”.  

PMHx: recent smear +ve pulm TB. No DM/HIV/CKD/Liver dz by hx. Nonsmoker, minimal EtOH.  

Meds: “4 TB tablets” (likely INH/RIF/PZA/ETH). No B6 mentioned. NKDA.  

O/E:  
Obs: BP 118/72 HR 86 RR 18 SpO₂ 98% RA T 36.9  
Gen: thin but not wasted, looks tired, NAD, talking full sentences  
Chest: mild crackles/bronchial BS RUL, rest clear, no ↑WOB  
Abdo: soft NT  
Neuro grossly non-focal. No jaundice. Anxious, circumstantial.  

Impr:  
1) Pulm TB – smear +ve, early tx (day 6) – clinically stable, mild improvement, no red flags for CNS/disseminated TB or DILI currently. Likely drug‑susceptible on standard HRZE via hosp TB service (needs confirmation). Still likely infectious.  
2) Infection control / contacts – share house, close contacts need screening.  
3) TB drug monitoring – on hepatotoxic regimen, baseline LFTs unknown.  
4) Psychosocial stress re work / visa / stigma.  

Plan:  
- TB regimen:  
  - Explained ongoing TB mgmt via hosp TB clinic; GP support only.  
  - Pt to bring all TB med boxes + hosp letters next review (written reminder).  
  - Will request hosp resp/TB clinic letter → confirm regimen, doses, sensitivities, planned duration, sputum/CXR schedule.  

- Ix today (baseline here – aware likely done in hosp but not on file):  
  - FBC, UEC, LFTs ordered (Sonic).  
  - Review results in 1/52.  

- Advice / safety net (brief – time):  
  - ED/000 if ↑SOB, CP, haemoptysis, persistent high fevers, confusion, severe headache/neck stiffness, jaundice/dark urine/severe abdo pain, sudden visual change, marked numbness/weakness.  
  - Emphasised strict daily adherence – no skipping doses; if forget and same day → take when remembered (not double).  

- Infection control / work:  
  - Advised likely still infectious, off work (hospitality) at least 2/52 or until TB clinic clears.  
  - Stay home except medical appts, cough etiquette, hand hygiene, try to sleep separate from others if possible.  
  - Encouraged to tell housemates to get checked – public health/TB clinic to assist.  

- Pyridoxine / comorb screen:  
  - Will check with TB clinic if B6 already on board; if not, consider pyridoxine 25 mg daily next review.  
  - HIV/DM likely already screened in hosp per pt (“they took lots of blood”) – will confirm when letters arrive; if not done, will arrange.  

- Psychosocial:  
  - Brief reassurance re visa (“treatable, main issue is sticking with treatment”).  
  - Suggested uni student support for financial/academic issues.  
  - Provided simple med cert today “unfit for work x 2/52” – no TB details; will clarify with TB clinic/public health before any more detailed workplace letter.  

- Other issues (back pain, “weak immunity from too much screen time”) not addressed today → needs separate appt.  

Follow‑up:  
- Review 1/52 with results + hosp correspondence + med boxes. Reassess sx, adherence, SEs, infection control.  
- Earlier ED review if red flags as above.  

Billing:  
- Level C, bulk billed.
