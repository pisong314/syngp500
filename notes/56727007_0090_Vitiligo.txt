P  
Vitiligo  
- Start pimecrolimus 1% cream BD to affected facial areas (peri‑oral/eyelids) x 3/12  
- Start mometasone furoate 0.1% oint OD to depigmented patches hands/ankles/feet only x 3/12 then review. Avoid face/flexures/genitals.  
- Sun protection discussed briefly. Pt interested in cosmetic camouflage – advised can trial OTC high‑coverage products.  
- If poor response by ~6/12 → consider derm re‑referral for phototherapy (pt aware work/time issues).  

Thyroid  
- TSH, fT4 ordered today (S&N). Will review and adjust thyroxine PRN – call/MyHR once results back.  

Pernicious anaemia  
- Continue hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM q3/12 with PN (next due ~2/52). FBC next chronic review.  

Mental health  
- Acknowledged distress re appearance. Offered Better Access psych – pt prefers to wait, will reconsider at review.  

F/U  
- Review 3/12 vitiligo response + TFT/B12/FBC planning, longer appt for “tired all the time” etc  
- RTC earlier if rapid spread, new eye/ear sx, cream reaction, mood deterioration/SI.
