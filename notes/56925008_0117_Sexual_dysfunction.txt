Path (S&N, done last visit – revwed today)  
- FBE: WNL  
- UEC, LFT: WNL  
- Lipids: TC 5.8, LDL 3.6, HDL 1.1, TG 1.9 → mild dyslipidaemia  
- HbA1c 5.7% (high-normal, no DM)  
- TSH 1.8 (N)

Assesment  
1. Sexual dysfuntion – low libido, dyspareunia, ↓orgasm. Likely multifactoral (mood, body image, wt, reln factors). Need to excl local pelvic pathology (endometriosis/PID/vaginismus/pelvic floor etc).  
2. Depressive d/o, currently untreated, no acute risk disclosed.  
3. Obesity (BMI ~40) with disordered eating pattern – ↑CVD risk, impacts mood + sexual function.  
4. Vit D insufficency.  
5. Mildly abn lipids – ↑long term CVD risk, not diabetic.  

Plan  
- Explained blod results in simple terms (via daugther): thyroid and “sugar” ok, no diabetes; cholestrol a bit high; Vit D low.  
- Start Vit D: cholecalciferol 1000 IU PO daily (OTC ok).  
- Discussed sexual issues briefly, validated concerns, advised common and treatable.  
- Red flags screened – none currently (no PCB, no abn discharge, no systemic sx).  

Further workup / fup  
- Book LONG appt 20–30 mins in 2–3 wks, with prof interprter (not family) + female dr if can:  
  - Full mental health review (consider K10/PHQ9, MHCP if agrees – Better Access).  
  - Screen for eating d/o, consider dietitian/psych referral (eating/body image, sexual health).  
  - Pelvic exam + swabs as indicated, STI screen, pap/HPV status check, consider pelvic floor issues.  
  - Discuss options for antidepresant with lower sexual SE profile if treating mood.  
- Lifestyle: brief discusion re gentle ↑activity, small wt loss benefits; defer detailed plan to long appt given ED hx.  
- Provided crisis contacts (Lifeline etc); advised ED/000 if SI emerges/worsens.
