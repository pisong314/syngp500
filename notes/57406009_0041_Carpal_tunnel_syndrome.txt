- NCS explained, recommended given duration + DM – pt declined  
- Surg referral not indicated – no weakness/thenar wasting  
- RTC earlier if ↑numbness, weakness, dropping objects, constant severe pain  

Plan – chronic dz (brief today):  
- Explained DM/thyroid/RA ↑CTS risk  
- Pt wants quick consult, defers full review  
- Path (S&N):  
  - HbA1c, fasting lipids  
  - UEC, LFT, urine ACR  
  - TSH, FT4  
  - FBC, ESR/CRP (MTX + inflam arthritis)
