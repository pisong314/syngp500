- Intermittent foul L otorrhoea esp post‑shower / dusty sites. Settled last 3/52 after ciproflox/hydrocort gtts.  
- L CHL – “turn my good ear esp w/ background noise”.  
- No current otalgia at rest, no vertigo, no fevers, no facial droop, no severe HA.  
- Reports no visible L pinna/auricular swelling or discharge today.

ENT letter (4/12/24 – copy in file, reviewed)  
- Conf L attic cholesteatoma + CHL. For tympanomastoid “when theatre time available”.  
- Advice: strict dry ear, avoid instrumentation, ↓high‑noise exposure, prompt Tx of infective flares, red flag education (vertigo, facial palsy, severe pain, systemic sx).

Admin / forms  
- Pt: “They said they need something from my doctor to explain why I can’t be around too much dust and noise all day.”  
- Also requesting support re quieter, less damp housing (current rental noisy/damp).  
- Agreed to complete Housing NSW / Centrelink forms today based on hx + ENT corr.

A:  
1) L attic cholesteatoma + chronic OM w/ L CHL – currently clinically stable, awaiting ENT surgery.  
2) Occupational aggravation (noise/dust) → sx flares.  
3) Housing issues contributing (damp/noise) – needs more suitable envt for chronic ear dz and future post‑op recovery.  
4) Admin: Housing NSW / Centrelink medical report.

P:  
- Forms: complete today – document:  
  • Dx: L attic cholesteatoma + chronic OM, L CHL.  
  • Requires surgery at tertiary ENT; currently on wait list.  
  • Needs: dry ear, avoid water ingress; avoid prolonged high‑noise/high‑dust exposure; regular follow‑up.  
  • Note functional impact: hearing impairment, ↑sx w/ dust/noise, difficulty resting in noisy/damp housing; recommend more stable, quieter, less damp accommodation.  
- Meds: no change. No new scripts. If flare (↑pain/otorrhoea) → review same day for otoscopy ± repeat ciproflox/hydrocort gtts (PBS).  
- Work: advised minimise very high‑noise/high‑dust tasks where possible until post‑op; offer work letter/cert if needed (pt to request).  
- F/U:  
  • Routine F2F 2–3/12 or earlier if flare.  
  • Same‑day/ED if red flags: new vertigo, facial weakness, severe HA, high fever, sudden ↑unilateral HL.  
  • Pt briefly mentioned ↑fatigue – asked to book separate std F2F for general review/bloods if persists (not addressed today due to time).
