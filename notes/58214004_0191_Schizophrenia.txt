22/11/25 TH video f/up – metro

42M Aboriginal on DSP. Hx schizophrenia (on depot), COPD/asthma overlap, poor dentition. Lives alone.

Reason: wants to “check I’m doing the right thing with my food” / lifestyle.

HPC  
Very tangential, needs constant redirection  
Diet: says “been trying to eat better since that diabetes talk on TV”. No known DM. Still lots of takeaway, skips brekky, soft drink ↓ a bit (“don’t have it for brekky anymore, just when the footy’s on”). Mostly white bread from corner shop. No structured exercise, occasional walk “to Centrelink and back”.  
MH: reports “pretty steady… voices there but like background radio”. No recent admit. On LAI q4/52 via CMHT, next due ~6d. Sleep late, wakes late. Denies SI/SH when asked clearly. Low motivation, stays home mostly.  
Resp: known COPD/asthma overlap, heavy smoker ~1 pack/day (“I know it’s no good but it calms me down”). Cough “same as usual in the mornings”, no ↑SOB, no CP, no change sputum. Wonders if “mould in the bathroom and the cat hair” making breathing worse.  
Dental: “bad teeth”, intermittent L upper toothache, worse chewing that side. No facial swelling, no fever, no dysphagia. Eats softer foods some days.

SH (brief): on DSP, low income, uses cheap takeaway a lot. Linked CMHT. Telehealth via mobile, video glitchy but ok.

Meds (per record + pt)  
- LAI antipsychotic (paliperidone/risperidone type) q4/52 – via psych clinic, next 6d  
- Salbutamol inhaler PRN – 1–2 puffs AM if “tight”  
- ICS/LABA preventer previously – pt “had the brown one, don’t know where it is now”  
NKDA

MSE (via video)  
Casually dressed, a bit dishevelled, talkative, tangential but cooperative. Mood “alright… bit flat sometimes”. Affect mildly restricted. TF: tangential, not grossly disorganised. TC: background voices, reality testing ok, no delusions voiced. No SI/HI. Insight partial, accepts need for depot.

Exam (TH limited)  
Looks well, speaking full sentences, no audible wheeze, no ↑WOB. No obvious cyanosis. Gross neuro non-focal. Missing upper teeth visible, points to L upper molar region.

Dx  
1) Schizophrenia – chronic, stable on LAI, residual +ve/-ve sx, no current risk  
2) Lifestyle / ↑cardiometabolic risk in SMI – poor diet, sedentary, antipsychotic, ?metabolic screen overdue  
3) COPD/asthma overlap – clinically stable today, ongoing heavy smoker  
4) Poor dentition with intermittent dental pain – no current red flags  
5) Social disadvantage (Aboriginal man on DSP) impacting diet/dental access

Plan  
MH  
- Cont LAI via CMHT as arranged  
- Reinforced adherence (“jab keeps you steady even when you feel ok”)  
- Crisis nos reminded (Lifeline, MH triage)  
- Review MH ~3/12 or earlier PRN

Diet / lifestyle  
- Simple goals only (given tangential):  
  • swap 1 soft drink/day → water or sugar-free  
  • ≥1 piece fruit/day if affordable  
  • 10 min walk ≥4d/wk (“walk round the block after the news”)  
- Explained ↑risk DM/heart dz with schizophrenia + meds  
- Pt agreeable in principle to dietitian via GPMP/TCA – arrange at longer F2F 20–30 min in 4–6/52  
- At that visit: check wt, BP, fasting lipids, fasting BSL + HbA1c, FBC, U&E, LFTs

Resp / smoking  
- No features AE today.  
- Reiterated smoking main issue > mould/cat.  
- Brief MI – not ready to quit, willing “maybe half a pack some days”.  
- Offered NRT + Quitline – wants to “think about it first”.  
- Plan: F2F lung review next visit – spirometry, sats, confirm need for preventer, inhaler technique.

Dental  
- Paracetamol PRN (≤4 g/day). Salt water rinses PRN.  
- Eligible public dental via DSP – advised to book; suggest CMHT/AHW help with appt.  
- Red flags: facial swelling, fever, dysphagia, rapidly ↑pain → ED/urgent review.

Investigations (next F2F – not done today TH)  
- Fasting bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, lipids, fasting glucose, HbA1c  
- Consider ECG (antipsychotic monitoring) if >12/12 since last  
- Spirometry + oximetry F2F  
- Dental review via public dental

Coordination  
- Send brief summary to CMHT case manager (pt ok) → focus on diet, smoking, dental, need help with public dental + pathology attendance  
- Next longer appt: GPMP/TCA for chronic psychosis + resp dz + metabolic risk. Plan referrals: dietitian; consider EP if engages.

Safety net  
- Advise 000/ED if acute SOB, CP, haemoptysis, rapid MH deterioration (distressing/command voices), or facial swelling/fever/dysphagia.  
- Book F2F 20–30 min within 4–6/52 for physical review, bloods, lung review, GPMP/TCA. RTC earlier if worse.
