Screening impression

ASSESSMENT  
1 Occupational burnout 58535001 in context of high demand hosp nursing role emotional exhaustion depersonalisation/irritability ↓personal accomplishment ↑absenteeism sig functional impact at work preserved function at home  
2 At risk anxiety/depn disorder currently subthreshold no acute risk features  
3 Work related stress requires structured mgmt plan workplace engagement rather than ad hoc sick leave alone  
4 Fatigue likely 2° above but need to exclude common reversible causes (iron deficiency thyroid B12 etc) esp given pt concern re “iron”  

Clinical reasoning  
Pattern tightly temporally linked to work environment w partial remission on days off argues for occupational burnout rather than primary MDD  
Retained capacity for pleasure in non work domains nil pervasive anhedonia nil global psychomotor change further supports  
Risk profile currently low given clear denial SI good supports future orientation but high occupational risk if sedation used given RN role hence avoid benzos as per national deprescribing and psychotropic safety guidance  

PLAN  

# Mental health / burnout  
Explained dx of occupational burnout overlap vs distinct from MDD and GAD as per current MH guidelines emphasised modifiable factors self care boundaries workload negotiation early psych input  
Recommend longer consult within 1/52 for full MH assessment MHCP consideration and more detailed risk review pt agreed reluctantly  
Discussed re engaging w EAP for short term counselling advantage of workplace specific understanding  

Psych referral  
Explained typical wait for private psych may be several weeks–months will still generate referral letter today at pt request but advised cannot guarantee appt within 4/52 interim mgmt via GP + psychol/EAP  
?public psych access limited without clear severe mental illness criteria discussed briefly  

Meds  
Discussed in detail why benzos eg diazepam not appropriate for ongoing work stress esp for shift working RN responsible for pt safety risks sedation impaired alertness dependence tolerance as per local and national guidelines  
Offered stepped approach non pharmacological first sleep hygiene ↓caffeine behavioural strategies  
Explained if insomnia and mood/anx sx persist or escalate could consider SSRI or possibly short term sedating AD (eg low dose mirtazapine) or melatonin after full MH review and baseline bloods at next R/V  
Pt visibly frustrated queried “other doctors dont have a problem with it” boundaries reiterated emphasised professional obligations and AHPRA expectations re safe prescribing eventually accepted plan though sceptical  

# Work / certificates  
Provided med cert to cover previous 2/7 absent + additional 3/7 from today total 5/7 to allow rest + time to organise supports  
Explained any extension beyond 5/7 or formal RTW/modified duties plan will require longer f/u assessment possibly involve occ health/HR  
Pt requested “2 weeks minimum” advised will reassess sx function at R/V before longer cert issued  

# Fatigue / baseline Ix  
Ordered bulk billed pathology  
- FBC  
- U&E LFT  
- TSH  
- Iron studies incl ferritin  
- B12 folate  
- Fasting glucose lipids (opportunistic baseline)  
Explained rationale exclude common reversible contributors to fatigue acknowledge likely normal but appropriate given sx and pt concern re iron  

# Lifestyle / self management  
Brief advice  
- Caffeine aim ↓ esp after midday on day shifts and limit on nights  
- Sleep hygiene wind down routine avoid phone in bed relaxation strategies  
- Encouraged re engage in enjoyable activities on days off walks time w partner/friends to counteract cynicism/withdrawal  
- Alcohol aim ≤1–2 std drinks on days she chooses to drink several AFD/wk reminded EtOH can worsen sleep architecture mood  

# Safety / crisis  
Risk currently low SI nil good supports  
Provided info re crisis supports Lifeline Beyond Blue and local ED if acute deterioration SI or unable to cope  
Advised RTC earlier if mood worsens emergent SI self harm thoughts or if work performance errors concerning her  

Admin / billing  
Walk in std consult MBS 23 bulk billed  
Pathology forms given  
Psych referral letter to be typed and faxed later today  

Follow up  
Book long appt 20–30min within 1/52  
- r/v blood results  
- full MH assessment formal scales PHQ9 GAD7  
- consider MHCP psychol ref  
- reassess fitness for work need for further cert graded RTW plan if indicated  
Asked pt to bring any prev bloods/letters from usual GP  

Pt response  
Pt somewhat frustrated re no benzo and shorter cert “what’s the point of coming here then” reiterated understanding of distress clarified clinical rationale safety concerns outlined clear stepped plan  
Ultimately accepted pathology forms psych ref med cert booked f/u remains partly sceptical but engaged  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 — ignore old recall flags will update after next R/V
