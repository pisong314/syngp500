Reason: f/up bloods / “general check-up”, fatigue  

37F RN, rotating shifts public hospital. Says “I’m fine, don’t want to be a bother” but actually c/o months of tiredness, worse on work days. Thinks “just night shifts / getting older”. Some trouble sleeping esp after late/nights – can’t get to sleep, wakes a few times thinking about work. Getting ~4–5h on work days, a bit better on days off.  

Work stuff coming out slowly – feels “over it”, more tearful driving home, says she’s snappy with partner/colleagues, more cynical at work. Still enjoys partner/dog/TV when not exhausted, not really going out much socially. No panic, no SI, no self-harm thoughts. Still functioning at work but says making more “little mistakes”, double-checking meds more.  

Headaches tension-type after runs of shifts, using occasional Panadol/Nurofen. Some mild epigastric discomfort she blames on too much coffee on nights. No wt loss of concern (maybe 2–3kg over ~6/12, thinks due to skipped meals at work). Alcohol low – ~3–4 std drinks/week, no binge, no drugs. Non-smoker.  

PMHx essentially nil, no prior MH dx. NKDA. No regular meds. Lives with partner, supportive.  

O/E  
BP 116/74, HR 76 reg, RR 14, afebrile, SpO2 99% RA, BMI 23.4. Looks a bit tired but well. CVS/resp/abdo unremarkable. Neuro grossly normal.  
MSE: well groomed in work clothes, pleasant, guarded initially, minimises. Briefly teary re: work pressure. Mood “tired and over it”, affect mildly restricted but reactive. Thought form logical, no psychosis, no SI. Good insight re work stress but downplays own needs.  

Ix – results from last visit (fatigue screen)  
FBC, U&E, CMP, LFT, TSH all WNL.  
Fasting glucose, HbA1c WNL (first time checked).  
Lipids: TC 5.4, LDL 3.4, HDL/TG ok. No previous lipids on file to compare. No obvious organic cause for fatigue on current bloods.  

Impression (not in neat order sorry):  
- Occupational burnout / work-related stress (RN in busy public ward). Emotional exhaustion, reduced sense of achievement, cynicism, irritability, sleep disturbance, fatigue, headaches. Still functioning, no clear MDE at present but at risk if continues.  
- Sleep disturbance – shift work + stress.  
- Mild dyslipidaemia – non-urgent, lifestyle focus.  

Plan – limited time today, standard consult, mainly addressed MH/work:  

• Burnout / MH  
  - Normalised/validated, discussed as occupational stress, not “personal weakness”.  
  - Encouraged limiting extra shifts, ok to say no to overtime; suggested consider talking to NUM re roster (fewer consecutive nights if possible).  
  - Discussed psychology (CBT, stress mgmt, boundaries). Pt initially reluctant “others have it worse” but open to think about it.  
  - Plan for formal Mental Health Treatment Plan next longer appt (needs more time for full hx + K10 etc).  

• Sleep  
  - Non-pharm focus – basic sleep hygiene, reduce caffeine esp later in day, wind-down routine after shifts, environment for day sleep after nights. No hypnotics started.  

• Lipids / general health  
  - Brief lifestyle chat – diet, exercise. Will do proper CVD risk calc and lipid discussion at later review when not squeezed for time by MH issues. No meds today.  

• Meds  
  - No psychotropics started. Discussed SSRI as future option only if mood/anxiety worsens or function declines – not indicated now. Continue PRN simple analgesia for headaches.  

Safety: no SI, low acute risk. Advised to book earlier/ED if mood drops markedly, any SI, or unable to cope at work/home.  

Follow-up  
Booked long appt in ~2 weeks (20–30 min) for:  
- more structured MH review + MHTP  
- psychology referral  
- review sleep/fatigue and how work changes going  
- revisit lipids/CVD risk and broader preventive stuff  
Asked her to keep rough diary of shifts, sleep hrs, and days she feels particularly “drained vs ok” to help tease out patterns.  

Billing: Level B today, bulk billed.  

[Note to self for next time: check if any previous lipids elsewhere, consider eHealth/My Health Record before deciding re repeat timing.]
