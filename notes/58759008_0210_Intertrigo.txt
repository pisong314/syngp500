HPC  
3/52 itchy red rash under both breasts worse heat/long shifts  
No new soaps etc  
No fevers wt loss night sweats  
Very anxious re “breast cancer / flesh-eating bug” wants “bloods + scan”  

O/E  
Obs WNL afebrile  
Breasts: bilat inframammary erythematous plaques in folds, maceration + superficial fissures, fine scale, few small satellite papules. Mild odour. No pustules/ulcers.  
No masses, no nipple change, no peau d’orange, no LAD. Lesions confined to folds only  

A  
1) Intertrigo inframammary – likely candidal  
2) Health anxiety re malignancy  

P  
- Explained likely candidal intertrigo, low suspicion IBC/malignancy today (bilat, fold-limited, no mass or nipple changes)  
- No ix today – agreed will consider swab + fasting BSL/HbA1c if poor response at review  
- Clotrimazole 1% crm bd x14/7 then 3/7 post-resolution (20g, 1 rpt)  
- Hydrocortisone 1% crm thin layer od prn itch max 5/7 (15g, no rpt)  
- Advise keep folds dry, cotton bra, avoid talc/irritants, can add zinc oxide barrier after a few days (OTC)  
- Reassured but pt still somewhat fixated on cancer – offered longer appt to discuss anxiety / poss psych referral → pt agreeable, to book 20 min separate  

Safety net  
RTC 10–14/7 or earlier if ↑redness, pain, spread beyond folds, systemic sx, nipple change or lump  

F/U  
Review rash 10–14/7  
If not much better → swab MC&S, fasting BSL ± HbA1c, reconsider dx (psoriasis/contact derm/erythrasma)
