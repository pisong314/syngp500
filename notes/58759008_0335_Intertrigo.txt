72F known to practice  

Cc: rash under breasts / “general check-up”

HPC  
Rash under bust “on and off for months” worse last 2–3/52  
Itchy, burning, red, “moist”, slight odour when bad  
↑ with heat, sweating, bra on all day, gardening  
Better if aired. Using sorbolene + talc. Had “white tube” antifungal from usual GP ~6/12 ago, used ~1/52 then stopped, rash recurred  
No fever, rigors, spreading erythema, pus, systemic sx  
No groin/perianal rash atm  
Pt keen on abx – “my usual doctor always gives me antibiotics for this” → explained not indicated

PMHx: denies DM, CVD, other chronic dz  
Meds: PRN paracetamol only  
NKDA

Exam (limited TH)  
Well, NAD, speaking full sentences  
Skin: video view inframammary folds bilat – erythematous, macerated plaques, well-demarcated, ?satellite papules, no obvious ulcer, no pus, no clear cellulitis. c/w intertrigo likely candidal

Dx  
1) Intertrigo inframammary – chronic/recurrent, ?candida, mild–mod, no systemic red flags  
2) Gen health check – not done today (time, pt focus on rash)

Mx  
– Explained dx + why no oral abx (no cellulitis)  
– Topical clotrimazole 1% cream bd to affected areas x ≥2/52 & few days after resolved  
– Zinc-based barrier cream (thin layer) after antifungal absorbed, esp hot days  
– Advice: keep area clean/dry, avoid soap/perfume, loose cotton bra/clothes, change bra daily, low-fragrance detergent  
– Avoid talc on moist/broken skin

Ix  
None today – plan fasting bloods (HbA1c, lipids, UEC, LFT, +/- FBC) at dedicated health check appt (QML/SNP) given age + recurrent intertrigo ?occult DM

Safety net  
RTC/f2f urgently if ↑redness, warmth, swelling, pus, systemic sx, or no improvement / worse in 7–10/7

F/up  
– Review rash TH or f2f ~2/52  
– Book longer appt 4–6/52 for full 75+ health check incl BP, wt, CV risk, screening, vax + order bloods then  

Pt verbalised plan (“fungal cream twice a day, keep it dry, barrier cream”) though still prefers “stronger cream” – will reconsider steroid short course at review if poor response.
