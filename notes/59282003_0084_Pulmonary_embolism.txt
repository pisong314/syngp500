72F f/up post hosp PE/AF  

HPI  
Admit 10d ago GCH w SOB + pleuritic CP  
CTPA: seg/subseg PE RLL/RML  
Trop↑ (peak 85) RV strain on echo (mild RV diln, mild ↓RV fxn, LV ok) no lysis  
Now day 4 apixaban (10 bd → to 5 bd D8)  
Today: much better, mild SOB stairs only, no CP at rest, tiny pleuritic twinge R base, no haemoptysis, no leg sx, no presyn/syncope  
Very worried “heart blood test high / heart attack?” → explained likely from PE not classic MI  

AF hx >5y, now more persistent per hosp. On ↑metop succ 47.5 mg mane. No palps today. Mild fatigue only  

Pt with “list” (shoulder, toenail, bloating, skin, vax etc) → advised focus PE/AF today, book long appt. Pt agreeable but keeps circling back  

PMHx (relevant)  
PE (new, interm risk)  
AF  
?HTN (prev perindopril – unclear)  
?HCL  

Meds  
Apixaban 10 mg bd x7/7 then 5 bd  
Metoprolol succ 47.5 mg mane  
Paracetamol prn  
Stopped fish oil (bleed risk)  

Allergies: NKDA  

Exam  
BP 132/78 HR 88 irreg irreg RR18 SpO₂ 95% RA afeb BMI~30  
CVS: AF, rate controlled, no oedema  
Resp: ↓BS + fine crackles R base only, no wheeze  
No clinical DVT  

Ix today  
ECG: AF VR ~80 no ST-T ischaemic changes (similar to ED)  
Bloods ordered: FBC U&E LFT coag fasting lipids HbA1c (baseline on DOAC + CV risk)  
No trop rpt (asx, recent)  

A/P  
1) PE interm risk, improving  
- Unprovoked (no surg/travel/HRT), RF age/BMI/AF  
- Cont apixaban as per hosp plan (10 bd total 7/7 then 5 bd ongoing)  
- Likely 6–12/12 AC → final duration after review RF/bleed risk + poss haematology/cardio input  
- Avoid NSAIDs/OTC that ↑bleed  
- Red flag: SOB/CP/haemoptysis/collapse/major bleed → ED/000  

2) AF persistent, rate OK  
- Cont metop succ 47.5 mg mane  
- CHADS₂-VASc ≥3 → stroke cover via apixaban (dual indication AF+PE)  
- Need BP trend + full CV risk next long appt  
- Consider cardiology once acute PE phase settled (AF strategy, review trop story, long-term AC plan)  

3) Trop↑ in hosp  
- Likely type 2 pattern from RV strain not primary ACS  
- No current CP, ECG non-ischaemic, obs stable  
- Will do structured CV risk w lipids/HbA1c + BP review next visit; consider further cardiac w/u depending results/sx  

4) “Shopping list” issues (shoulder, nail, bloating, skin check, vax etc)  
- Not addressed today (time, post-hosp priority)  
- Long appt booked 1/52 to go through 1 by 1 + review bloods, BP, PE/AF progress  
- She eligible flu + COVID booster → plan next visit once stable  

Driving: ok if feels well, avoid if dizzy/SOB  

F/up  
- 1 week long appt (20–30 min) booked – recall set  
- RTC earlier / ED if SOB/CP/haemoptysis/bleeding  

Billing: Level C, bulk billed
