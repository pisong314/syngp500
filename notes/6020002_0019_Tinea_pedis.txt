34M miner WA FIFO – known tinea feet. "Prob nothing but want it checked"

Hx:
– Interdigital maceration 4th–5th toes bilat R>L. Itch ↓ but still there. Mild burning end of shift in boots  
– Terbinafine 1% cream using ~od x ~2/52, often forgets bd, esp night shifts  
– Heavy steel caps 12–14h/d, very sweaty feet. Synthetic socks from work  
– No spread up foot, no nail ∆ per pt, no breaks/ulcer, no discharge, no malodour  
– No fevers/rigors, no red tracking, no calf pain  
– Mild groin itch "nowhere near as bad as toes" using same cream prn  
– PMHx: recurrent tinea pedis/cruris, plantar hyperhidrosis, mild atopic derm (quiet). No DM known

O/E (video – limited):
Looks well NAD.  
Feet: 4th–5th web spaces bilat white macerated skin + mild scaling, slight erythema edges, no obvious fissures, no weep/pus. Nails on view ok

Dx:
1) Tinea pedis – interdigital, partial response, ongoing RFs  
2) Tinea cruris – mild  
3) Plantar hyperhidrosis contrib  
4) Atopic derm stable

Ix:
– No mycology prev. If persists → in-person + scrapings (S&N / QML) + consider LFTs pre oral terbinafine

Plan:
– Optimise topical: terbinafine 1% cream bd to toe webs + 1–2 cm margin x min 14/7 then od x 1/52 after clear  
– Groin: terbinafine 1% od x 2–4/52  
– Gen measures briefly discussed: keep feet dry, change socks, thongs in shared showers etc  
– Consider antiperspirant spray to soles/toe webs for hyperhidrosis. If still bad → separate appt re stronger options

Red flags explained: ↑redness/swelling/pain, pus/foul smell, streaking up leg, fevers → urgent face-to-face (GP/ED)

F/up:
TH review 3–4/52 around off-swing. If no better → in-person review + mycology ± oral AF + LFTs

Pt: "I’ll be more consistent with the cream and socks" – agrees
