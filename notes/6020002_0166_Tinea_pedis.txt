22/11/25  Home visit  F/U  

82M Anglo-Aust, retired builder  

Reason: wants “COVID + flu jabs, quick one” + brief skin review  

Hx:
Known chronic tinea pedis + plantar hyperhidrosis + tinea cruris, onychomycosis prev noted  
Feet “same as always” itch / scale soles + webspaces, worse heat. Uses OTC clotrimazole intermittently only. Old steel-cap boots 20+ yrs, ↑ odour. No pain, no spreading redness, no fevers, no hx cellulitis  
Groin itch on/off yrs, worse sweating, using talc only  
No systemic sx today (no SOB/CP/cough/fever)  

Vax hx: last COVID booster ~11/12 ago (pt unsure), last flu last season at pharmacy. No prior vax rxn  

PMHx (relevant only): HTN, HLD, chronic fungal feet/groin, ?onychomycosis. No known liver disease, no DM (HbA1c 6.0% ~1 yr ago)  
Meds: amlodipine, atorvastatin, aspirin, OTC topical antifungal PRN  
Allergies: NKDA  

O/E (brief – pt rushing):  
BP 132/76 HR 78 RR16 T 36.6 SpO₂ 97% RA  
Looks well, NAD  
Feet: moccasin-type fine scale soles, mild erythema. Interdigital maceration/scale 3–4 + 4–5 toes bilat, no fissures, no ↑ warmth, no cellulitis, no ulcers. Mild malodour. Nails thickened yellow distal, c/w onychomycosis (unchanged)  
Groin: erythematous annular plaques with scale in inguinal folds bilat, c/w tinea cruris. No obvious 2° bacterial infxn  
CVS/resp – grossly normal  

Dx:
1) Need for vax – COVID-19 booster + seasonal flu  
2) Chronic tinea pedis (moccasin + interdigital) + plantar hyperhidrosis – persistent, no 2° infxn  
3) Chronic tinea cruris  
4) Onychomycosis – longstanding, reservoir, not treated today  
5) Chronic disease review deferred (time)  

Plan:
Vax:  
- COVID-19 mRNA booster IM (age-appropriate) today  
- Flu vax 2025 (adjuvanted ≥65) IM today  
Observed ~15 mins post – no immediate issues  
Flu vax + COVID recorded for AIR  

Skin:  
- Start terbinafine 1% cream (OTC or Rx) to BOTH feet incl between toes OD x14/7 then continue OD 1–2/52 after cleared  
- Same terbinafine 1% cream to groin OD x2–4/52, 1/52 past clearance  
- Gen measures discussed briefly: dry feet/groin well, avoid heavy old boots if poss, change socks more often. Advised more soap/bore water not helpful  
Hyperhidrosis feet:  
- Trial aluminium chloride hexahydrate 20% topical to soles nocte 2–3x/wk PRN (warned about irritation, apply to dry skin, wash off AM)  

Onychomycosis:  
- Explained likely contributing to recurrence. Oral tx (e.g. terbinafine PO) NOT started – need baseline LFTs + interaction review, and pt “doesn’t want tablets today”. Revisit later  

Ix:  
None today (time, stable)  
Plan next visit: fasting bloods – HbA1c, LFTs, U&E, lipids (for CVD review + if considering oral antifungal). Consider scrapings if poor response  

Safety-net:  
RTC/ED if ↑ redness, warmth, swelling feet esp tracking up leg, fevers/rigors, cracks/ulcers, difficulty walking, any post-vax red flag sx (SOB, chest pain, anaphylaxis features)  

F/U:
Home or clinic review 4–6/52 – check response to topical tx, reconsider oral antifungal, do chronic disease review + bloods. Pt agrees if home visit and “not too early”  

Billing:  
Home visit, bulk billed (rural). Vax supplied under NIP / COVID program, no charge to pt  

[Note: chronic HTN/HLD review + meds check to be done next visit – not covered today d/t time]
