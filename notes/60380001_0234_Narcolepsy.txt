A  
1 Narcolepsy w cataplexy established stable on modafinil daytime sleepiness and cataplexy unchanged  
2 Disturbed nocturnal sleep in context of narcolepsy + ↑stress + health anxiety → probable stress related insomnia sleep fragmentation common in narcolepsy  
3 Health anxiety longstanding pattern catastrophic misinterpretation of benign sx  

No current red flags for OSA cardiac or neuro pathology

P  
# Sleep / narcolepsy  
- Reassured pt exam and vitals reassuring nil signs CCF acute neuro or resp pathology explained nocturnal fragmentation common in narcolepsy  
- Discussed why “full body scan” not indicated potential harms overdiagnosis  
- Sleep hygiene discussed  
  • Consistent bed wake times even days off  
  • Avoid screens in bed suggest 30–60min wind down keep phone off bedside or DND  
  • Limit caffeine after ~1200 avoid energy drinks large coffees mid–late arvo  
  • Avoid clock watching wearables o/n if awake >20min get up quiet activity then back to bed  
- Encouraged planned 20min daytime naps on days off as per specialist but not after ~1500  
- If ongoing o/n awakenings >3/12 despite measures or partner later notes snoring gasping → re r/v sleep physician ± repeat PSG to re‑exclude OSA  

# Health anxiety / stress  
- Normalised some concern but highlighted pattern “cancer brain tumour dementia” despite normal findings brief CBT style explanation worry → ↑arousal → poor sleep cycle  
- Offered psych r/v for CBT re health anxiety and CBT‑I pt agreeable but cost concern will check PHI  
- Provided recommendation and letter for local psych service suggested reputable online resources eg Sleep Health Foundation instead of general Google  

# Ix  
Pt keen on “full bloods to check everything” negotiated limited screen  
- Ordered via SNP  
  • FBC  
  • UEC  
  • LFT  
  • TSH  
  • Ferritin  
  • B12  
  • Fasting glucose  
Explained if all WNL further testing unlikely to change mgmt at this stage  

# Meds  
- Continue modafinil 100mg mane 100mg midday as per sleep physician nil change today  
- Avoid sedative hypnotics given narcolepsy safety concerns if insomnia persists despite non pharm + psych input will discuss options w sleep physician  

# Driving / safety  
- Pt already avoids driving when very sleepy nil night shifts reinforced Aust fitness to drive standards advised to inform us or specialist if daytime sleepiness worsens  

F/U  
- R/v 3–4/52 std or long appt  
  • Check bloods  
  • Reassess sleep pattern health anxiety  
  • Consider MHCP if still problematic  
- Earlier R/V if new sx loud snoring witnessed apnoeas chest pain neuro sx sudden ↑daytime sleepiness mood deterioration  

Pt still abit worried asked again “Are you sure we shouldn’t do more tests” reiterated rationale she accepted plan will trial sleep hygiene and proceed w bloods today
