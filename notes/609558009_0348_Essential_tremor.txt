Has not done RAT – "wasn't sure if I needed to for just a temp". Flu vax this year. No known COVID contacts.  

Concerned re meds – "Could this be from the tremor tablets?" On propranolol 20 bd >3/12, tremor better, no recent dose change, no dizziness/syncope/wheeze/brady sx.

O/E (tel only)

Home obs: T 37.8, HR 74, BP 128/72. Denies feeling very unwell or light-headed.  

Imp  
1) Acute febrile illness – likely mild viral URTI vs early COVID/flu. Low risk, stable, no clear bacterial focus on hx  
2) ET – stable on propranolol. Fever unlikely drug-related (on tx long term, no rash/joint sx/mucosal involvement)  

Plan  
- Do RAT today → if +ve COVID follow current guidelines, call back/telehealth to discuss antivirals if indicated  
- If RAT -ve and sx persist/worse → F2F review 24–48h for full exam ± COVID/flu/RSV PCR, urine dip etc  
- Paracetamol 1 g up to QID (max 4 g/24h) prn  
- Fluids, rest  
- Safety net: ED/000 if SOB, CP, confusion, can't stay awake, blue lips/face, very unwell with high fever not settling. Review here same day if fever >48–72h, ↑ cough, new SOB, new focal pain (urinary/abdo/sinus/ear)  
- Continue propranolol 20 bd – no indication to stop  
- Routine ET/med review separate appt 4–6/52 if well  

No immediate bloods – watchful waiting reasonable given mild sx + supports. If sx >3–5d or localising → FBE, UEC, CRP, resp PCR, urine as indicated.  

Pt agrees with plan, "happy just to watch it at home for now as long as I know when to worry".  

F/up: telehealth or F2F 2–3d if fever persists or earlier if deteriorates.
