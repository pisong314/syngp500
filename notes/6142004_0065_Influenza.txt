72F f/up – HA, recent flu + chest infxn  

HPC  
Seen 5/7 ago here – fevers, myalgia, cough. Resp PCR +ve Influenza A. Sputum S. pneumoniae (sens pen/Augmentin). Started oseltamivir + amox/clav 875/125 BD.  

Today: ongoing HA “all over”, dull ± throb, ↑ w cough/bending fwd, ~6–7/10. No photophobia, no neck stiff. No focal neuro sx. Denies visual loss/diplopia/weakness/speech ∆/confusion/seizure. No vomiting. Eating ↓ but drinking some.  

Cough persisting, yellow sputum, says fevers mostly settled, feels “washed out”. Mild ↑ SOB on exertion but talking in full sentences. No CP.  

PMHx (from EMR – pt vague): HTN, HLD, OA knees. No AF, stroke/TIA, DM recorded.  
Meds (EMR): perindopril 5 mane, atorva 20 nocte, PRN paracetamol. Amox/clav 875/125 BD day 5/7. Oseltamivir 75 BD x5/7 completed.  
Allergies: NKDA recorded.  

O/E  
Obs: BP 138/76 HR 92 reg RR 18 T 37.6 SpO2 95% RA. Looks tired but well, speaking full sentences.  
Neuro: AOx3, GCS 15, CN grossly intact, power 5/5 all limbs, no focal deficit, gait steady, neck supple, -ve Kernig/Brudzinski.  
ENT: mild frontal sinus TTP. Throat mildly red, nil exudate.  
Resp: ↓AE bases, coarse crackles RLL, no wheeze, no ↑WOB.  
CVS HS I+II, no murmur.  

Ix (reviewed)  
Resp PCR (5d ago): Influenza A detected, COVID/RSV -ve.  
Sputum: S. pneumoniae sens to amox/clav.  
CXR (same day): RLL patchy consolidation c/w pneumonia.  

A  
1) HA in context recent Influenza A + pneumococcal pneumonia – likely post-viral / sinus / cough strain. No red flag neuro, no meningism, obs OK → low suspicion ICH/meningitis at present.  
2) Influenza A – clinically improving, completed oseltamivir.  
3) Pneumococcal LRTI/RLL pneumonia – day 5/7 amox/clav, clinically improving, residual cough/fatigue.  
4) 72F ↑risk complications – needs close f/up.  
5) ?suboptimal paracetamol use, poor historian.  

P  
- Reassured re low likelihood stroke/meningitis today  
- Analgesia: advise paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24h). Wrote dose on printout for pt. Avoid NSAIDs for now.  
- Continue amox/clav 875/125 BD with food to complete 7/7 (2 more days).  
- Expect slow improvement over next 1–2/52.  
- No further antivirals.  
- Safety net: ED/000 if sudden severe “worst” HA, confusion, ↓GCS, neck stiff, new focal neuro sx, seizure, ↑SOB, CP, pleuritic pain, high fevers. RTC if not improving next few days.  

- Deferred bloods today (clinically stable, improving). If sx not clearly better or any deterioration → FBC/U&E/CRP in 5–7d (QML).  
- Repeat CXR ~6/52 to confirm RLL resolution – to book at next review.  
- Vaccines: noted flu vax >12/12 ago, pneumococcal ? – to review/improve once acute illness resolved, longer appt, bring records.  
- Chronic dz review (HTN, lipids) + full med rec + cognition screen (GPCog) later when well, bring all meds.  

F/up  
Review 3–4d or earlier if worse (HA, SOB, fever, neuro sx). Ask daughter to attend next visit if possible to assist with hx/meds.  
Plan at next if stable: arrange 6/52 CXR, update flu/pneumo vaccines, chronic dz check.  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L. Smith – phone f/up]  
Pt’s daughter rang – confirms mum taking “the big antibiotic twice a day” x5d so far, paracetamol only “now and then”. Reinforced max 4 g/day paracetamol and to complete 7/7 amox/clav. No new red flag sx reported. Will bring pt + meds to review on Mon.
