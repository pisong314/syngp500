Ix ordered today  
– Resp viral PCR (incl flu A/B, COVID) – NP swab  
– Sputum MCS if able  
– FBC, U&E, CRP (local path)  
– CXR PA/LAT – query RLL pneumonia. Report pend  

Impression  
?Flu-like illness D6 in high-risk older pt  
→ Likely influenza  
→ c/b suspected RLL community-acquired pneumonia  
Need to r/o COVID co-inf  

Plan  
1) Antiviral  
– Oseltamivir 75mg PO BD 5/7 (PBS, age ≥65 + ongoing sx). Explained benefit ↓ as days pass but still reasonable. Warned N+V, take with food  

2) Abx – CAP  
– Amoxycillin/clavulanate 875/125mg PO BD 7/7 (RLL pneumonia cover Strep pneumo etc)  
– Emphasised complete course even if better  

3) Symptomatic  
– Paracetamol 1g PO QID PRN (max 4g/day) for fever/myalgia/HA  
– Rest, fluids – brief  

Safety-net  
Discussed hospital vs home – pt “really doesn’t want hospital unless I’m absolutely dying”  
Currently stable obs, sats OK → trial outpatient but low threshold admit  
Red flags explained: ↑SOB esp at rest, chest pain not just on cough, confusion, can’t keep fluids down, worsening fevers, collapse → ED/000  

F/up  
Review 24–48h with GP (booked) or earlier if worse  
Review CXR + path + PCR then – adjust abx/antiviral, consider hosp if no improvement  

Preventive (deferred)  
Briefly rec flu vax + COVID booster once well – pt “not big on jabs, will think about it”. To revisit later.
