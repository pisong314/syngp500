PMHx (problem list – from record + briefly confirmed)

Social

Telehealth “exam” / risk stratification  
- Voice coherant speaking full sentences  
- Nil SOB CP haemoptysis presyncope palps systemic sx by hx  
- Describes area L medial calf as “a strip maybe the length of my hand and not very wide” previously slightly warm now “seems to be settling”  
- Able to weight bear walk inside ok  
- Given limitations of phone unable to assess calf circumference tenderness Homan etc  

Recent results (from record)  
- Last BP in clinic 3/24 132/78 on perindopril  
- Lipids 2/24 TC 4.5 LDL 2.2 on atorva 20 (prev LDL 2.8 9/23)  
- eGFR stable ~78 over last 12/12  

Assessment  
1) Vax needs 72 yr woman on apixaban hx PE  
- Appears up to date pneumococcal and shingles  
- Due for COVID19 booster (last 5/24 age >65 chronic venous disease hx PE)  
- Next flu vax due autumn 2026  
- No apparent contraindication from VTE hx or current apixaban  
- IM vax on DOAC generally low bleeding risk with firm pressure post inj  

2) Recurrent superficial phlebitis L leg hx provoked PE now on long term apixaban  
- By hx sounds like mild localised superficial thrombophlebitis vs simple varicose vein irritation  
- Low suspicion for extensive DVT or acute PE from phone screen but limited by telehealth unable to examine for cord warmth oedema etc  
- Important red flag given hx PE and some recent non adherence with apixaban  
- Needs in person r/v for leg exam assessment of extent proximity to deep system consider venous duplex U/S if any concern  
- Also oppurtunity to reinforce VTE education leg elevation mobilisation compression stockings  

3) Hx PE on long term apixaban – pt reluctant to continue  
- Haematology letter on file rec ongoing AC due to recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis and venous disease despite original PE being provoked  
- Pt querying if can stop now complex risk benefit needs longer face to face discussion ± repeat haematology opinion  
- For today brief reiteration that missing doses ↑ VTE risk and that COVID infxn itself ↑ clot risk more than vax  

Plan  
# Vaccinations  
- COVID19  
  - Recommended updated seasonal mRNA booster as per ATAGI for >65  
  - Explained clot hx not a contraindication infection itself ↑ VTE risk  
  - Pt hesitant does not want “a whole bunch of them at once” but agrees to COVID booster alone for now  
  - Plan nurse appt within next 2–3/52 for COVID booster  
  - Continue apixaban usual dosing on day firm pressure 2–5 min post inj  
- Influenza  
  - Not yet available for 2026 season recall set for autumn  
- No further pneumococcal or shingles vax needed currently  

# L leg phlebitis / VTE risk  
- Explained sx most consistent with mild superficial phlebitis given short segment tender line over known varicosity and settling sx  
- However due to hx PE on AC and recent missed doses advised in person review  
- Booked F2F appt within 3–5/7 for leg exam vitals AC review  
- If on exam extensive superficial thrombophlebitis esp near saphenofemoral junction or any calf swelling etc will arrange urgent L leg venous duplex U/S  
- Safety net  
  - Advised ED/urgent care if any of  
    - Sudden or worsening calf/thigh pain or swelling  
    - New SOB CP haemoptysis feeling faint palps  

# Anticoagulation / PE follow up  
- Briefly re-explained rationale for ongoing apixaban per previous haematology advice  
- Encouraged strict adherence missing doses ↑ risk recurrent PE/DVT  
- Pt currently has enough apixaban ~1/12 will check repeats duration at F2F  
- Plan longer discussion next visit re duration of AC bleeding risk vs VTE risk consider updated haematology r/f if contemplating change  

Other issues  
- Pt asked if “sitting in the recliner too long” caused the clot advised prolonged sitting is a contributor but main focus on regular walking leg elevation when resting weight control and taking apixaban  
- Mentioned intermittent nocturnal “heartburn” chose to defer given time asked to book separate standard consult if persisting or worsening  

Follow up  
- Nurse appt 2–3/52 COVID booster  
- GP F2F in 3–5/7 for L leg exam vitals AC review detailed discussion re ongoing apixaban ± haematology r/f  
- Earlier ED if red flag sx as above  
- Pt verbalised understanding though tends to minimise sx “nearly didn’t bother ringing”  

Learning points (registrar)  
- Telehealth assessment of possible VTE quite limited phone hx can stratify but low threshold for in person exam esp with prior PE on AC  
- Good opportunity to link vax counselling with discussion re VTE risk from COVID infection  

[Supervisor addendum – Dr ___ 16:40]  
Reviewed case with reg  
Agree likely mild superficial thrombophlebitis by hx low suspicion DVT/PE but agree F2F exam within few days appropriate given hx PE and recent missed apixaban  
Happy with plan for COVID booster nurse clinic and to continue apixaban for now until proper risk–benefit discussion  
ED advice for red flags appropriate
