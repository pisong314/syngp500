22/11/25  RACF round – f/up

82M long-term RACF. Seen in room.

CC: “Just a general check-up doc” → focus today on swallowing

HPC  
Known benign oesoph stricture + GORD + Barrett + EoE. Last scope ~18/12 ago, Barrett no dysplasia, dilatation then.  
Last 2–3/52 eating slower, leaving meat. Intermittent solid dysphagia esp meat/bread – “feels like it sticks halfway down then I cough it back up with water”. No complete obstruction, handling saliva, no drooling. No odynophagia, no CP. + occasional regurg undigested food.  
Pt says “I’m pretty right overall” but staff note pants looser. wt chart ↓ ~2 kg/3/12 (78→76 kg). Appetite “ok but the food’s a bit dry”. Thinks tea “too strong” and “all the tablets together are scratching the food pipe”.  
Known poor PPI adherence – “I keep forgetting before brekkie… I ran out of those reflux tablets before I came in here and never bothered”. MAR: freq refusals/delays AM meds.  
RACF RN: often refuses meds, “couldn’t be bothered going into town” re previous appts. Pt confirms.  
No hx food bolus needing ED. No haematemesis, no melaena, no known IDA. No cough/asp/rec CXR issues.

PMHx (relevant)  
– Oesoph stricture – GORD/Barrett/EoE related, mult prior dilatations  
– Barrett oesophagus (non-dyspl last scope)  
– GORD  
– EoE (prev topical steroids via gastro)  
– HL, OA knees, mild CKD 2–3 (eGFR ~55)  

Meds (per chart, adherence poor)  
– Esomeprazole 20 mg mane (often late/omitted)  
– Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte  
– Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN  
– PRN antacid mix (rare)  
NKDA

Exam (focused)  
Gen: frail, NAD, talking full sentences, no drooling  
Obs: BP 138/76 HR 76 RR 16 SpO₂ 97% RA afeb  
Abdo soft NT, no epigastric TTP  
Wt per chart ~76 kg (↓ ~2 kg/3/12)

Recent ix  
RACF bloods 6/12 ago: FBC N (Hb 132), U&E eGFR 56, LFT N. No recent Fe studies. Last gastro letter 18/12 old – Barrett no dysplasia, stricture dilated.

A  
1) Oesoph stricture with GORD/Barrett/EoE – recurrent solid dysphagia, no acute red flags (saliva ok, no severe CP, no haematemesis). Likely progression in setting poor PPI adherence. Needs repeat scope ± dilatation, Barrett/EoE reassessment, r/o Ca.  
2) Poor med adherence – longstanding, contributing to sx.  
3) Mild unintentional wt loss – likely multifactorial (dysphagia, food texture, age). Needs monitoring.  
4) Barrett oesophagus – overdue surveillance.  
5) EoE – needs specialist review re med/diet.

P  
– ↑ Esomeprazole to 20 mg BD (before breakfast & evening meal) as per eTG. RN to give pre-meals, emphasise “for your swallowing/reflux”, document refusals.  
– RN: supervised admin all meds; flag if >3 PPI doses missed/week.  
– Diet: soft/moist diet, extra gravy/sauce, avoid dry meat/crusty bread, smaller slower mouthfuls.  
– Consider SP review if dysphagia persists or any asp concern.  
– Safety net to pt + staff: if unable to swallow saliva, drooling, severe CP post food, or food bolus not passing within ~1–2 hrs → call ambulance → ED for urgent scope.  
– Re-referral to local public gastro clinic for semi-urgent OGD + biopsies (Barrett surveillance, EoE, assess/widen stricture, r/o malignancy). Note prior reluctance to attend – will discuss with kids/EPOA to encourage + help with transport.  
– Bloods via RACF: FBC, Fe studies, U&E, LFT, CRP.  
– Wt weekly x 2/12; dietitian if ongoing ↓.  
– Plan to involve family next review to reinforce meds + need for gastro appt (no time to ring today).  
– Other chronic issues (HL, OA, CKD) stable, defer detailed review to next round.

F/up  
– Review 2–3/52 next RACF round: check dysphagia, PPI adherence, bloods, wt, gastro appt details.  
– Earlier review/ED if obstruction / red flag as above.
