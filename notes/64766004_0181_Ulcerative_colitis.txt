22/11/25  New pt – walk‑in BB clinic Newcastle  

32F h/o UC (~7y), EN, episcleritis. Wants “proper check‑up re UC”. Very fixated on diet/“chemicals”, argumentative re advice.

Cc: UC review / “general health check”  

S:  
UC dx’d RNSH colonoscopy per pt. Extent unclear (“whole colon stuffed”). Last scope ~2–3y ago “mild inflammation” – no report.  
Current sx 2–3/12:  
- 3–4 BMs/d, formed–soft  
- Small PR blood on paper ~1x/wk  
- Mild urgency few x/wk, no noct diarrhoea  
- No sig abdo pain (occasional mild cramp pre‑BM), no wt loss, fevers, NS, SOB, dizziness, syncope  
Meds: mesalazine (Salofalk) 2.4g PO od – admits ↓ adherence “miss a few days”; PR Salofalk enemas PRN, last ~6/12 ago. No steroids/biologics currently (last pred ~2y).  
EN last flare ~1y ago, resolved. Episcleritis ~6/12 ago, settled w lubricants (optom only). No current eye sx.  
Strong belief gluten/tap water trigger flares. Wants less focus on meds “mesalazine pointless – YouTube US specialist said”.

O:  
Obs: BP 112/68 HR 78 RR 14 T 36.8 SpO₂ 99% RA BMI 23 (wt stable by report)  
Abdo: soft, mild LLQ/suprapubic tend on deep palp only, no G/R, no masses, BS N.  
Skin: no active EN. Eyes: no injection.  
PR exam declined.

A:  
1) UC – likely mild activity, clinically stable. No red flags for acute severe UC. Extent + mucosal status unknown (no recent scope). Adherence suboptimal. Needs specialist FU + surveillance colonoscopy (7y dz).  
2) EN / episcleritis – currently quiescent.  
3) Preventive care gaps – not addressed today (time + pt not keen).

P:  
- Continue mesalazine 2.4g PO od (reinforced role in maintenance + CRC risk ↓ – pt sceptical but agrees “for now”).  
- If ↑ PR blood/urgency → restart mesalazine enemas nocte 2–4/52; if no improvement 1–2/52 → RTC.  
- No indication today for steroids/biologic escalation – mild sx, obs stable. Explained escalation usually via gastro + scope, not internet.  

Ix ordered (S&N):  
- FBC, U&E, LFT  
- CRP, ESR  
- Iron studies, B12, folate  
- Coeliac serology (tTG‑IgA, total IgA) – pt v focused on gluten, agreed to test once.  
Results pending – review next visit.

Refs:  
- Gastro (routine) – ongoing UC mgmt, confirm extent, plan surveillance colonoscopy, consider treat‑to‑target.  
- Ophthal – advised if episcleritis recurs / any eye pain/redness/↓vision → urgent review (pt not wanting routine ref now).

Safety‑net:  
Advised ED/urgent review if ≥6 bloody stools/d, severe abdo pain, T >38, vomiting, tachycardia, dizziness, unable to keep fluids, black/tarry stool; or acute eye pain/redness/visual change.  

Preventive care:  
Not covered today – time/rapport issues. Needs longer appt for CST, vax (flu, COVID ± pneumococcal if immunosupp planned), contraception etc – pt non‑committal.

F/U:  
RTC 1–2/52 (long appt if poss) to review bloods + UC sx + discuss colonoscopy/gastro plan. RTC earlier if worse.
