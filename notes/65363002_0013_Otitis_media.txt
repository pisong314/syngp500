Plan  

# Mum – AOM R  
- Discussed natural hx AOM  usu settles 2–3/7 sx may last up to 7/7  
- Start oral abx given sig pain bulging TM need to remain functional caring for newborn  
  • Amoxycillin 500mg PO 8 hourly x 5/7  
- Analgesia  
  • Paracetamol 1g PO 6 hourly prn max 4g/24h  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg PO 8 hourly prn wf if nil GI renal issues  
- Safe in breastfeeding at these doses reassured  
- Adv complete course  RTC if rash SOB severe diarrhoea or if pain ↑ despite regular analgesia  
- Red flags for urgent r/v or ED  ↑severe ear pain esp nocturnal  post auricular swell/redness  facial weakness  persistent high fevers feeling systemically very unwell  

# Baby – brief advice ?self limiting viral illness (no formal dx today)  
- Reassured current exam reassuring  emphasised age <2/12 high risk  low threshold for ED  
- Safety net given to mum  
  • ED immediately if temp ≥38 again (rectal/axillary)  
  • poor feeding eg misses ≥2 feeds or ↓wet nappies  
  • lethargic floppy difficult to wake  
  • fast or laboured breathing grunting blue lips  
  • persistent vomiting or new rash  
  • or "just not right" major change in behaviour  
- Smoke exposure  advised partner to smoke outside wash hands change shirt before handling baby where possible  wood smoke may irritate airways but unlikely main issue here  
- Visitors  ok to limit contact with unwell visitors esp from childcare  emphasised hand hygiene  

Meds changes today  
- New Rx Amoxycillin 500mg TDS x 5/7 for AOM  
- Suggested add ibuprofen prn in addition to paracetamol for pain control
