CC:  
28yo F – “ear’s playing up again, same as last time” – wants repeat abx for L ear infxn  

HPC:  
Hx recurrent OM. Seen UC ~3 wks ago for L ear, given amox 500mg tds 7/7. Says “I took every single one, didn’t miss any”. Much better by day 3, pain + fevers settlled.  
Last 3–4 days: L dull ear ache 3–4/10, blocked, ↓hearing L. “Sounds thru the implant are more muffled when it flares”. No R ear pain. No otorrhoea, no vertigo, no new tinnitus, no facial weakness, no mastoid pain.  
Mild temps at home to 37.8, a bit “tired and crook” but eating/drinking ok. No cough, ST, runny nose.  
Pt feels “it all came back when I stopped the antibiotics” and asks for same amox again. Worried heater at night “might be drying my ears and making them worse”.

- Down syndrom  
- Recurrent OM  
- L cochlear implant (implanted childhood, last ENT/audiology review ~6/12 ago, stable)  

Meds:  
- Nil regulr

O/E:  
Gen: alert, NAD, talking in full sentances.

- R ear: canal/TM normal.

No meningeal signs, gait normal.  

Ix:  
No tests today – clincally recurrent AOM L, no systemic toxicity.  
EMR checked – immunis up to date incl pneumo childhood. No recent ear swabs on file.  

Impression:  
1) Recurrent acute otitis media – L, in adult w Down syndrome + cochlear implant. Partial response then relapse post amox → treat as amox fail. ↑risk of complxns but no red flags for mastoiditis, facial palsy, intracranial spread today.  
2) L cochlear implant in situ – subjective ↓hearing when OM flares, no signs of implant site infxn.  
3) Down syndrome – predisposed to middle ear disease.  

Plan:  

- Abx:  
  → Start amoxycillin + clavulanic acid 875/125mg PO bd 7/7 (Augmentin Duo Forte – PBS).  
  Counseled: take with food, finish course. Common SE GI upset/diarrhoea, rash. Warned re allergy – “if you get hives, trouble breathing, lips/tongue swell, go straight to ED”. Pt had mild loose stools last time – reassured, keep fluids, RTC if severe.  
  No ear swab at this stage as uncomplicated and recent oral abx only.  

- Analgesia:  
  Paracetamol 1g q6h PRN (max 4g/24h).  
  May add ibuprofen 400mg tds PRN with food if needed.  

- Referrals / follow‑up:  
  → ENT ref done today (HealthLink) – recurrent L OM in pt with cochlear implant + Down syndrome. Ask for review of implant integrity, consider audiology + imaging if indicated.  
  Pt advised to ring cochlear clinic if persistant ↓hearing after infxn settles.  

- Safety net:  
  ED/urgent review if:  
  • ↑ear pain not settling with analgesia  
  • New dc, severe headache, vomiting, vertigo, new/worse tinnitus, sudden hearing drop  
  • Mastoid swelling/tenderness, facial droop, high temp, feels very unwell/confused.  
  If not improving or worsens after 48–72hrs on Augmentin, to see GP same day or ED given implant/Downs.  

- Preventive / other:  
  Briefly discussed recurrent OM; will need longer appt after ENT review to talk preventn, vacc check etc. Pt keen – “I just want to stop this happening all the time”.
