Reason for visit: fever / ear pain f/u  

S:  
32y F, Aboriginal, review of R ear infecton seen OOH 3 days ago. Was given amox 500mg tds x7/7 but very poor complaiance, “only had a couple when it got really bad”.  

4–5 days fever, Tmax ~38.8 at home, on/off, some relief with panadol.  
R ear: started sharp pain, now dull ache, worse at nite, blocked, ↓hearing. No d/c. No vertigo, no facial weaknes. Mild L ear fullness, much less. Mild HA.  
No cough, SOB, CP, sore throat, D/V. Feels “washed out”, stopped work yest.  

PMHx:  
- Recurrent ear infections as child, adenoid issues  
- L cochlear implant post meningitis age 12 – says hearing “fuzzier” last few days but still ok, no pain at implant site  
- Nil known immune issues  
Non-smoker.  

Meds:

L TM mildly injected, ?effusion, no bulging, ↓mobility.  
No mastoid swell/erythema/tenderness, no pinna protruson. Face symetrical.  
Neuro grossly NAD. Chest clear.  

(No recent labs for comparsion – last bloods >12m ago, not reviewed today.)  

A:  
1. Acute otitis media R, probable early bilat, persisting fever likely due to poor abx adherence  
2. L OM with effuson  
3. Higher risk – Aboriginal, L cochlear implant, childcare exposure, crowded housing  
4. Hx adenoid disease / ET dysfuncton  

No current red flags (no mastoiditis, facial palsy, meningism, stable obs).  

P:  
- Stop current irregular amox course, re-start as new regimen:  
  • Amoxicillin 875mg PO bd x7/7 (PBS, script given)  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1g q6h PRN (max 4g/24h)  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg q8h PRN with food if needed, no known CI  
- Adv: RTC/ED if ↑pain, new ear d/c + bad HA, mastoid swelling/redness, facial weakness, persistent vomiting, confusion, very high fever, or any concern at cochlear implant site (red, swollen, very sore, sudden hearing change).  

- If not improving in 48–72hrs on regular abx:  
  → change to amoxycillin–clavulanate 875/125mg bd x5–7/7  
  → arrange urgent ENT review (public metro ENT) to assess for complications / implant involvment  
  → consider FBE, CRP, UEC ± blood cultures if more systemically unwell.  

- Medical cert given for rest of week; advised off childcare work until fever-free 24hrs and feels better.  

- F/U booked in 2 days for ear re-check and symptom review (earlier if worse).  
  Next visit: check pneumo/adult immuns & consider non-urgent ENT if recurrent / not settling.  

Pt agrees to take abx properly now, declined immediate ENT today but ok with low threshold referal if not improving by review.
