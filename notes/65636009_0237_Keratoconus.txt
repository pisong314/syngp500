27M “general check-up + few things”  

Hx  
- Known bilat keratoconus dx ~2y via optom → public ophthal. On RGP CLs. Says “mostly fine, bit scratchy end of the day”  
- Asking if screens + pre-workout caffeine “making the cone thing worse / drying eyes out”  
- No acute red flags: no sudden ↓vision, pain, redness, photophobia, discharge, halos, diplopia  
- Hx eye rubbing (allergy) – says “trying not to now”  
- Last ophthal ~8/12 – told stable, ?CXL if progression. Next appt ~4/12 booked  

- Main non-eye issue = fatigue 2–3/12. FT IT helpdesk, high screen time, 5–6h sleep wkdays. No snoring/apnoeas reported  
- Feels “a bit run down, probably just screens and not moving much”  
- No wt loss, fevers, night sweats, SOB, CP, bowel change, bleeding, recurrent infx  
- Denies low mood / anhedonia / SI  

- Multiple extra issues raised but not covered (time): R shoulder ache at gym, clicking jaw, mild dandruff, wants skin check “few moles”, Qs re protein / pre-workout  

O/E  
Obs OK: BP 118/74 HR72 afeb SpO₂ 99% RA BMI ~27  
Eyes: no obvious corneal scar/opacity on torch, no red, no discharge. VA with CL ~6/7.5 OU. PERRLA, EOMI. No photophobia  
Otherwise NAD  

Ix  
Ordered today (baseline fatigue / FHx T2DM):  
- FBC  
- U&E, LFT  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
- TSH  
- Ferritin, B12, folate  

(No prior labs in file to compare)  

A  
1) Keratoconus bilat – stable on hx, no acute red flags, under public ophthal (next 4/12)  
   Screen time / caffeine unlikely to affect progression. Main RF = eye rubbing (discussed)  

2) Non-specific fatigue – likely multifactorial (↓sleep, sedentary, screens). Low suspicion serious pathology but reasonable screen given FHx metabolic dz  

3) Multiple minor issues (R shoulder gym pain, TMJ click, dandruff, skin check, supplements) – not addressed today due to time  

P  
- Keratoconus:  
  • Cont RGP CL + lubricants PRN (e.g. Systane)  
  • Reinforced NO eye rubbing, manage itch with drops/cool compress  
  • Reassured re screens/caffeine – OK in moderation  
  • Keep ophthal appt; earlier review if sudden ↓vision, pain, red eye, photophobia, CL intolerance → ED if severe  

- Fatigue:  
  • Bloods as above – fasting  
  • Brief lifestyle chat: aim ↑sleep, some regular exercise, better diet (↓takeaway)  
  • Review 1–2/52 for results + fatigue reassess  

- Other issues:  
  • Advised long appt (20–30 min) next few weeks for shoulder/TMJ/dandruff/skin check + supplement Qs – pt agreed (reluctant but understands)  

RTC 1–2/52 or earlier if worse
