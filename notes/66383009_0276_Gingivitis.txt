Follow up – “hard stuff on gum / teeth dirty” (pt via daughter, acts as interpreter).  

42 y/o Aboriginal woman, T2DM, epilepsy, depression. Works in disability support.  

Main issue today:  
- c/o “hard stone on teeth near gum”, “yellow rock on bottom teeth” x ~3–4 months, slowly worse.  
- Gums “red, bit puffy”, bleed when brushing. No pain. Family notice bad breath.  
- No fevers, no facial swelling, no swallowing issues, no loose teeth reported.  

Daughter also asking if “epilepsy tablets rotting her teeth” + worried about sugar/tea.  

Oral hygiene: brushes once daily, quick. Rarely floss. Lots of sweet tea/cordial/soft drink including at night. No dentist for >5 yrs (cost).  

Past hx (relevant):  
- T2DM ~6 yrs, on metformin XR 1 g mane. Last HbA1c 8.3% (S&N 3 wks ago).  
- Epilepsy – sodium valproate 500 mg BD, last seizure >1 yr.  
- Depression/anxiety – sertraline 100 mg mane.  
- Mild microalbuminuria – on perindopril 5 mg mane.  
No known drug allergies.  

Exam (focused):  
BP 126/78, HR 78, afebrile, BMI 31.  
Mouth: lips/mucosa intact, no ulcers/thrush. Generalised red, mildly swollen gums esp lower anteriors, bleed on gentle probing. Clear yellow-brown calculus along gingival margins esp lingual lower incisors, around upper molars. No obvious caries, no obvious loose teeth on finger pressure. No pus, no gingival recession. No cervical LAD.  

Impression:  
1) Gingivitis with calculus build-up – mild–mod, no clinical evidence of periodontitis today. Likely driven by plaque, sugary drinks, suboptimal brushing; diabetes contributing.  
2) T2DM – suboptimal control (HbA1c 8.3%), high sugar intake, oral health likely affecting control and vice versa.  
3) Epilepsy / depression – stable; meds may contribute a bit to dry mouth but not primary cause of current gum issue.  

Plan:  
- Explained to pt/daughter that this is gum inflammation + tartar, not infection needing abx, and not teeth “rotting from tablets”.  
- Oral care: advised brush BID with soft brush + fluoride paste, focus on gum line; start daily interdental cleaning – suggested daughter help. Kept instructions simple due to language/cognitive issues.  
- Short course chlorhexidine mouthwash:  
  • Chlorhexidine 0.12% 15 mL, swish 1 min then spit, BD x 7 days only, after brushing. Warned about possible staining/taste change, don’t swallow. No known allergy.  
- Dental: written referral to local public dental / AMS dental clinic for scaling and review (lower cost). Daughter to book; offered nurse help to call but daughter prefers to ring herself.  
- Diabetes: reinforced link between sugar, gum disease and BSLs; advised cut down sweet drinks esp overnight (water only after night brush). No med change today – review at next diabetes appt.  
- Path: no new bloods today (recent set via Sullivan Nicolaides with HbA1c 8.3% already). Will repeat diabetes panel (HbA1c, lipids, UEC, urine ACR) closer to next chronic disease review – to be ordered then.  

Family/carer input:  
- Daughter reports pt “doesn’t really understand” brushing instructions unless shown; she agrees to supervise brushing and reduce soft drink at home.  

Admin/billing:  
- Bulk billed. Dental referral letter printed and given to daughter.  

Follow up:  
- GP review 4–6 wks to re-check gums and see if dental visit done; also revisit sugars/diet.  
- RTC/ED/dentist sooner if gum pain, swelling, fever, trouble swallowing or sudden loose tooth.  

(Full diabetes/epilepsy review + foot check deferred – booked in ~2 months).
