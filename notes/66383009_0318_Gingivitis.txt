22/11/25  After hours GP – Brisbane metro  
New pt, no previous records. Bulk billed.

c/o “hard yellow stuff along the gums, doesn’t come off when I brush”. Thinks maybe from energy drinks / dry mouth / diabetes. No pain.

Middle‑aged Aboriginal man (~42) with known T2DM (off all meds “for ages”), depression/anxiety hx, smoker/vaper. Hasn’t seen dentist “5–6 years”.

Main issue today = teeth/gums
- Noticed yellow/brown build up esp lower front teeth, a few months at least, getting worse last 2–3/12  
- Gums “puffy”, bleed when brushing, not otherwise. No ulcers, no toothache, no facial swelling, no trouble eating  
- Brushing most nights only, no floss. Lots of soft drink/energy drinks. Partner has commented on bad breath sometimes

Exam (quick, limited – torch only)  
- Gen: well, NAD, afebrile, BP 132/82, HR 84, looks mildly overweight  
- Mouth: generalised soft plaque + obvious supragingival calculus along gingival margins, esp lingual lower incisors and buccal upper molars. Gums erythematous, mildly swollen, bleed a bit on gentle probing. No obvious caries, no broken teeth, no mobility on finger pressure. No pus, no abscess, no sinus, no trismus. Tongue/buccal mucosa/palate normal, no thrush.  
- Neck: no tender nodes

Imp/Plan (a bit all over the place due to time)

1) Gingivitis with calculus / plaque build‑up  
   - Looks like uncomplicated gingivitis, no evidence of periodontitis or acute dental abscess today. Reassured pt not an emergency but needs dentist for clean.  
   - No indication for abx.  
   - Rx: chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.12% 15 mL bd x 7 days then stop (PBS OTC – advised may stain teeth/taste change, don’t swallow, don’t use longer term).  
   - Advised brush bid with fluoride toothpaste, start floss/interdental cleaning – kept brief.  
   - Strongly advised dental review for scale/clean within next few weeks. Gave details for local public dental clinic + nearby ACCHS dental as he’s Aboriginal and low income.

2) T2DM – off treatment, likely poorly controlled  
   - Previously on metformin, stopped when ran out, hasn’t seen usual GP. Unsure last HbA1c but “a bit high”.  
   - Very brief chat re link between poor sugar control and gum disease.  
   - No scripts restarted tonight (after‑hours, single‑issue consult, no recent bloods).  
   - Asked to book longer daytime appt with usual GP or local AMS/ACCHS in next 1–2/52 for full diabetes review (HbA1c, UEC, LFT, lipids, urine ACR, meds restart). If can’t get in, can book long appt here.  

3) Smoking/vaping, ETOH, depression/anxiety – background only today  
   - Smokes ~10–15/day + nicotine vape, drinks “few beers most nights”. Past amphetamines (stopped per pt).  
   - Mood low in the past, off antidepressants now, no SI volunteered.  
   - Very brief advice re smoking effect on gums and general health, advised discuss cessation options + mental health plan with regular GP/ACCHS at review. No med changes today.

Safety net / follow‑up  
- Red flags discussed: seek urgent dental/ED/GP if facial swelling, severe tooth/jaw pain, fever, difficulty swallowing or opening mouth, feeling very unwell.  
- Needs:  
  - Dental appt 2–4/52 for scaling/clean and ongoing care  
  - GP/ACCHS appt 1–2/52 for diabetes + mental health/substance use review (long consult).  
- Time limited (~10–12 mins), more detailed chronic disease management deferred. Pt understands and “just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something serious”.
