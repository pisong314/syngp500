22/11/25 10:15 – Home visit – Brisbane

Reason: pt asked for home visit to “go through all the blood tests and scans properly, the calcium and the vitamin thing”.

79F, lives alone, known primary hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, Vit D deficiency, HTN, HLD.

Very tangential historian, long stories re neighbour, Google etc, needed repeated redirection. Main concern = meaning of recent bloods + fear of “too much calcium hardening arteries / kidney stones from vitamin D”.

Path results (S&N, done earlier this month – copied from last review, checked today):
- Corr Ca 2.82 mmol/L (prev 2.88)
- PTH 15 pmol/L (↑, similar to prior)
- eGFR 64 mL/min (stable), Cr 78
- Phosphate low–normal
- 25-OH Vit D 44 nmol/L (prev 28)
- ALP mildly ↑

Known hx:
- Primary hyperparathyroidism x ~3 yrs, likely single adenoma. Endocrinology at tertiary centre, last seen ~6/12 ago. Surgery discussed previously – pt strongly reluctant, endo happy with conservative mx while Ca only mildly ↑, kidneys ok, no stones, largely asx.
- Osteoporosis (DEXA ~18/12 ago: LS ~–2.8, hip ~–2.6). On alendronate weekly + Vit D. No Ca tabs.
- Vit D deficiency – on colecalciferol 1000 IU daily.
- No known CKD, no nephrolithiasis hx.

Today – symptoms:
Denies classic hyperCa sx: no polyuria, no polydipsia, bowels ok, no N/V, no acute confusion (daughter also apparently not concerned per phone last week). Longstanding mild fatigue only. No flank pain/haematuria. Chronic low back ache unchanged.

Meds (checked Webster in kitchen):
- Alendronate 70 mg weekly (Sat)
- Colecalciferol 1000 IU daily
- Perindopril 5 mg mane
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN
No Ca supplements (stopped ~18/12 ago). No OTC/herbals currently.

Obs at home:
BP 136/72, HR 76 reg, RR 16, SpO2 97% RA, afebrile. Looks well, hydrated, ambulates slowly with 4WW.

Brief exam only (time):
CVS/resp unremarkable, abdo soft NT, no CVA tenderness. No focal bone tenderness. Gait slow but steady with 4WW.

Assessment (scattered):

1) Primary hyperparathyroidism with chronic mild hypercalcaemia – stable  
Ca still only mildly ↑ and slightly improved vs last. PTH still ↑ as expected. Renal function preserved. No sx of severe hyperCa. Ongoing conservative mx appropriate per endo.

2) Osteoporosis – high fracture risk but clinically stable  
On bisphosphonate + Vit D, no recent falls or fractures. Some home falls risks (loose rugs).

3) Vit D deficiency – improving, still suboptimal  
44 nmol/L on 1000 IU daily. Need modest improvement only, avoid overtreatment given hyperPTH.

4) Communication style – tangential, but intact cognition once redirected. Impacts time/coverage of issues.

Plan:

Hyperparathyroidism / Ca:
- Continue current conservative approach.
- Reassured re: current Ca level, explained no urgent concern today.
- Avoid Ca supplements; dietary Ca in moderation ok.
- Encourage adequate fluids (no strict target documented).
- Tests ordered today via QML: UEC, CMP (incl Ca/PO4), PTH, 25-OH Vit D in 6/12 (or earlier if sx). Put reminder in system.
- Will forward summary + latest results to endocrinology before next review (~6/12).

Osteoporosis:
- Continue alendronate 70 mg weekly. Reiterated admin (upright 30 min, full glass water, empty stomach) as she reports occasional reflux when lies back down.
- Continue colecalciferol 1000 IU daily.
- DEXA: due around 2-year mark (another 6–12/12) – to arrange at clinic visit rather than from home (transport/logistics). Note in recall: “DEXA ~late 2026”.
- Falls/home safety briefly: advised removal/taping of loose hallway rugs; she will ask home care worker.

Vit D:
- Keep colecalciferol 1000 IU daily only. No high-dose loading.
- Aim Vit D ~50–80 nmol/L – recheck with 6/12 bloods.
- Reassured that at this dose + current Ca, kidney stone risk low, but we’re monitoring.

Other chronic issues:
- HTN, lipids appear stable today, scripts ok. Comprehensive chronic disease review (BP trend, lipids, vaccines, mood/cognition) deferred – asked to book longer appt (home or clinic) in 2–3/12.

Follow-up:
- GP review 2–3/12 (home vs clinic depending on mobility) for broader chronic care + check progress with home safety.
- Repeat bloods 6/12 as above unless new sx.
- Urgent review/ED if: new confusion, severe constipation or vomiting, can’t keep fluids down, new severe bone pain or fracture, marked ↑ thirst/urination, flank pain/haematuria.

Pt understanding:
She was able to summarise back (in her own way): “keep sipping water, don’t go mad on the cheese, stay on the little vitamin D, ring if I start weeing heaps or get really muddled”. Left brief written summary + copy of key results for her/daughter.

11:05 – left house.

[Added 16:30 by Dr K. Smith – quick review of note]  
Realised last DEXA date not in system – checked older scanned report: DEXA 04/05/24 (LS –2.8, TH –2.6). So next DEXA due ~05/26 not 2026/27 – corrected recall to “Review DEXA around 05/26”. Otherwise plan unchanged.
