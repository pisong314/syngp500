S  
72yo Anglo-Australian male r/v post hosp discharge 6d ago severe CAP c/b ARDS ICU + ETT  
C/O ongoing SOB + fatigue  

HPI  
Says mostly "alright just a bit puffed if I rush about" "dont want to be a bother" tends to minimise  
SOB  
- SOB walking lounge → clothesline ~20–30m + with 5–6 stairs needs to stop catch breath  
- nil SOB @ rest nil orthopnoea nil PND  
Cough  
- dry cough esp noc "bit of a tickle" nil sputum nil haemoptysis  
Chest discomfort  
- mild diffuse ache ant chest "like Ive pulled a muscle from all that coughing" nil pleuritic nil radiation nil diaphoresis nil N/V  
Fatigue  
- feels "abit washed out" naps arvo  

Since discharge nil fevers chills rigors appetite ↓ slightly but improving wt stable by report  
Nil leg swelling nil calf pain nil dizziness syncope confusion (wife agrees)  

Pt queries if "stale air in the house" with windows closed making lungs "crook" also worried re "too much tea" vs water intake reassured not main issue encouraged fluids  

Background  
Recent hosp stay ~3/52 severe CAP + ARDS  
- Intubated proned high FiO2  
- CT chest in ICU bilateral diffuse GGO ARDS pattern nil PE  
- Weaned to RA prior discharge  
Nil known COPD asthma HF prior  
Ex smoker quit ~25yrs 20 pack yr hx minimal ETOH  

Meds (per discharge confirmed)  
- Seretide 125 2 puffs BD via spacer 3/52 trial  
- Salbutamol 100mcg 2 puffs PRN SOB  
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN  
Nil other regular meds nil NKDA  

Social  
Lives with wife single level home metro previously independent walked to shops daily  
Wife present says he is "more short of breath than he lets on" transport ok  

O  
Gen thin elderly man stoic speaks full sentences mild ↑WOB when talking long nil distress @ rest  
Obs RA  
- BP 132/76  
- HR 88 regular  
- RR 18  
- SpO2 95% rest → 91–92% after brisk 20m walk corridor recovers 95% within 1–2min sitting  
- Temp 36.7  

Resp  
Chest expansion symm  
BS vesicular ↓ bases fine end insp crackles both bases L>R nil wheeze nil focal cons signs  
CVS  
HS dual nil murmur JVP not ↑ nil peripheral oedema  
Calves soft NT nil erythema nil swelling  
Neuro A+O speech coherant  

A  
1 Recent severe CAP with ARDS now early recovery phase  
   - Clin stable on RA mild exertional SOB + fatigue likely post ARDS changes + deconditioning  
   - Basal crackles likely residual inflam/fibrotic change post ARDS  
   - Nil current features to suggest recurrent infection HF or PE  
2 Post ICU deconditioning fatigue  
3 Psychosocial adjustment post critical illness coping ok tends to minimise sx good family support  

Diffs considered  
- Recurrent pneumonia unlikely afebrile nil sputum exam non focal  
- PE low prob nil pleuritic CP nil haemoptysis HR ok calves normal sats acceptable  
- Decomp HF unlikely nil oedema nil ↑JVP nil orthopnoea/PND  

P  
Ix today  
- Pulse oximetry rest + post exertion as above  
- Path today FBC U&E LFT CRP CMP incl albumin  

Ix ordered  
- CXR PA + lateral in 6–8/52 per hosp plan to assess resolution ARDS changes r/o evolving fibrosis  
- Spirometry + BD response ~8/52 once more stable to assess residual restrictive/obstructive pattern post ARDS  

Rx / Plan  
1 ARDS recovery phase  
- Continue Seretide 125 2 puffs BD via spacer for total 3/52 emphasised technique rinse mouth  
- Continue salbutamol 2 puffs PRN up to QID can use pre exertion if helpful  
- Graded activity advised  
  • short indoor walks 3–4x/day stop if markedly SOB  
  • gradual ↑ distance over wks avoid pushing through severe SOB "steady and slow wins this race"  
- Basic energy conservation strategies discussed sit for tasks pace activities  
- Ok to open windows for fresh air as tolerated reassured house air + tea intake not primary issue encouraged more water  

2 Rehab / referrals  
- Explained recovery from ARDS + ICU may take months normal to feel tired  
- Discussed pulmonary rehab pt initially reluctant "dont want to take a spot someone worse might need"  
  → plan consider ref to local hosp based pulm rehab at next r/v if ongoing limitation  

3 Psychosocial  
- Brief screen mood nil clear depn or anhedonia "just tired thats all"  
- Wife notes he is a bit quieter than usual plan closer mood review if persists  

Safety net  
Given tendency to minimise sx advised pt + wife seek urgent review / ED if  
- SOB ↑ at rest or with minimal exertion vs today  
- New chest pain esp central heavy or pleuritic  
- Fever rigors new productive cough  
- Marked ↓ exercise tolerance vs today  
- If they purchase oximeter SpO2 persistently <92% @ rest  

Deferred issues  
- Longstanding tinnitus "bit of ringing in the ears" non urgent book separate appt once resp status more settled  
- Full CVD risk workup lipids BP monitoring etc deferred until recovery phase  

F/U  
- GP r/v 2/52 re SOB function and bloods consider pulm rehab ref then  
- Further r/v ~8/52 with repeat CXR + spirometry results consider resp physician f/u per hosp plan send ref if not already arranged  

Pt understanding  
Pt + wife verbalise understanding though pt still abit dismissive of sx agreed to monitoring and to seek help if red flags
