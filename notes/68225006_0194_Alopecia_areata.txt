Rx / Plan 14:20  
- Dx alopecia areata explained briefly (autoimmune, patches, good chance regrowth w limited disease). Reassured not shampoo-related; tight hair may cause other alopecia but doesn’t fit.  
- Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% lotion scalp  
  - Apply thin layer to patches nocte, massage into skin (not hair) up to 3–4/12  
  - Avoid face/unaffected scalp  
  - Warned re local skin thinning if overused  
- Expectation: may see fine regrowth after several weeks; need ≥3/12 to judge.  
- Info re AAAF website given (noted in passing, pt in hurry).  
- FU 8–10/52 to review response (or earlier if rapid progression/new patches/brows/lashes involved/extensive loss).  
- If no response or worsening → consider derm referral / intralesional triamcinolone.  
- Safety-net: RTC/ED if sudden extensive hair loss, infection at site, or mood deterioration / thoughts of self-harm.
