32F review post LP / ?IIH  

Hx:  
Chronic daily HA ~4–5/12, ↑ last 2/12. Neuro o/p review 3/52 ago → ?IIH. MRI/MRV per pt phone: no mass, venous sinuses patent, “features c/w IIH”. LP last wk: OP 32 cmH2O, CSF normal (per pt).  
On acetazolamide 250 BD x 2/52. Says HA ~30–40% better but still 3–4 “bad days”/wk, needs dark room after work. No current N/V. Mild photophobia only.  
Visual sx: transient “grey out” secs esp on standing, a few/wk. Brief horiz diplopia when very tired. No persistent VF loss or ↓acuity reported.  
Concerned re LP result “high pressure” + side effects (paraesthesiae fingers, ↑freq urine) – tolerable, worried if “normal”. Also notes ~8kg wt gain last yr.  

Meds:  
- Acetazolamide 250mg BD (neuro)  
- COCP (EE/levonorgestrel) >10 yrs  

Allergy: NKDA  

O/E:  
Anxious but well, NAD  
BP 118/72 HR 78 RR 14 T 36.7 SpO2 99% RA  
BMI 32  
Neuro grossly non-focal, gait normal  
VA 6/6 OU with glasses, CF VF full, colour vision normal  
Fundoscopy (limited, direct): ?blurred disc margins bilat, ?papilloedema, view suboptimal  

Ix (today):  
- FBC, UEC/eGFR, HCO3, LFT, lipids, fasting BSL/HbA1c → SNP / QML (check result inbox)  
Prev Ix (per neuro letter/pt phone): MRI/MRV no mass, no hydro, venous sinuses patent, partially empty sella. LP OP 32, CSF biochem/micro normal. Awaiting official reports in Best Practice / HealthLink – will chase if not in 1/52  

A:  
1) Idiopathic intracranial HTN (benign intracranial HTN) – typical demo (young ↑BMI F), MRI/MRV + LP OP↑, HA + transient visual obscurations, ?papilloedema on GP exam. Partial response to acetazolamide  
2) Obesity (class I) – likely contributing  
3) COCP use – ?contributor / VTE + wt issues. Needs review  

P:  
- Reassured re LP: OP↑ expected in IIH, no immediate “brain damage” but ↑risk permanent visual loss → needs close monitoring  
- Cont acetazolamide 250 BD for now (PBS). SE explained – paraesthesiae + polyuria common, ok if mild. Adv good hydration, RTC if SOB, severe fatigue, flank pain etc  
- NOT ↑dose today – neuro review booked ~4/52 (Bendigo/Wagga-type). Pt to bring today’s results + any eye reports  
- URGENT local ophthal / neuro-ophthal if possible: request formal VF (perimetry), VA, colour vision, detailed disc assessment. Referral done today “urgent – IIH / papilloedema, risk visual loss”. Asked for appt ≤1–2/52  
- Red flags → ED: sudden persistent ↓vision, new fixed diplopia/ptosis, “worst ever” HA esp w N/V/neck stiffness, focal neuro sx, confusion, seizure  
- Wt: brief chat only (time). Aim 5–10% loss 6–12/12. Cut sugary drinks/takeaway, ↑walking as tolerated. Referred PN + dietitian (local/telehealth) for structured plan. PN review booked next wk for wt/BMI/waist + goals  
- COCP: flagged as possible issue (IIH, VTE, wt). No change today (time + need contraception). Plan separate long appt 2–3/52 to discuss non-oestrogen options (LNG-IUD, Cu-IUD, implant, POP). Continue current COCP until then if no new red flags (leg swelling, CP, SOB, HA change)  
- Work: brief advice re regular breaks / hydration. Offered cert PRN – pt declines for now  

F/U:  
- Review 1–2/52 after ophthal + bloods (or earlier if visual sx/HA worse)  
- Neuro appt ~4/52 as planned  
- Long contraception / preventive care appt 2–3/52
