Reason for visit:  
L shoudler pain, + issue at urine opening  

HPI:  
71 yr old Anglo Aus woman, new pt.  
L shoudler “a bit sore for a while now” ~3 mths, gradual, no clear injury. Dull ache antero/lateral, with sharpe twinge on some movts. Wakes if rolls onto L side, trouble hanging washing / reaching OH, doing bra behind back. No neck pain, no radiatn past elbow, no pins/needles, no true weaknes.  
Using panadol 500mg 1–2 tabs once/twice a week only, doesn’t want to “live on tablets”.  

Also mentions “little red lump” at urine opening x ~6–8 wks. Mild off/on stinging at end of wee, had 2x tiny spots of blood on paper last month, nil since. No dysuria, no freq/urg, no visible haematuria in bowl, no vag bleed or discharge. Remembers someone years ago said “little caruncle”.  

Husband in waiting room, pt says he’s been nagging her to get shoulder checked as she’s using R arm more for chores.  

PMHx:  
Postmenopausal (early 50s). Denies IHD, DM, inflam arthritis, malignancy hx.  

Meds:  
Panadol prn only. No HRT, no blood thinners.  
No med changes today.  

Allergies:  
NKDA (pt aware).  

Exam:  
Obs stable: BP 136/74, HR 74 reg, afebrile, sats 98% RA.  

L shoudler:  
No deformty/swelling. TTP over greater tuberosity/subacromial area, ACJ NT.  
Active flexn ~120° painful, abd ~100–110° with painful arc ~70–120°. Int rot limited (can’t reach bra strap), ext rot ~45° mild pain. Passive ROM near full but end range pain.  
Jobe/empty can: pain + mild weak vs R. Pain on resisted ER. Impingment tests (Hawkins, Neer) +ve.  
Neck full ROM, no radicular signs.  

GU (ext only, chaperone present):  
Atrophic vulval skin. Small ~5–6mm soft red polypoid lesion at post lip urethral meatus, mild TTP, not friable, no active bleed or pus. Looks like urethral caruncle. No obvious prolapse.  

Urine dip: SG 1.020, pH 6.5, no blood, no nitrite, no leucs, no prot, glu, ket.  

Impresson:  
1) L shoudler pain – likely rotator cuff tendinopathy / subacromial impingment. No trauma, no red flag features.  
2) Urethral caruncle – small, likely benign, mild sx only, no haematuria on dip, no UTI. Needs non-urgent spec review given age + prior spotting.  

Plan:  

1) L shoudler tendinopathy / impingment  
- Advise trial regular paracetamol 1g qid prn (max 4g/day) for 1–2 wks to help with exs.  
- Avoid routine NSAIDs for now (age). Can use short course ibuprofen 200–400mg tds with food if really needed and no gut/renal issues – disc risks.  
- Basic home exs shown (pendulum, gentle wall walk flexn, start isometric ER later). Keep shoudler moving, avoid heavy OH lifting / hanging washing high – suggest lower line / help from husband.  
- Imaging: order L shoudler XR (AP, lat, axillary) to check OA/degenerative change, high-riding humeral head, calcific tendinopathy.  
- If not improving 4–6 wks, will arrnage US shoudler and consider physio vs subacromial steroid inj.  

2) Urethral caruncle  
- Explained likely benign but need to rule out rarer malignancy given age + prior small bleed.  
- Ix: send urine MCS + urine cytology (if lab does) today.  
- Refer non-urgent to urology (or urogynae depending local service) for confirm dx and mgmt options (topical oestrogen vs obs vs excisn if sx ↑).  
- No topical oestrogen started here – leave to spec.  
- Safety net: attend earlier/ED if visible haematuria, more frequent bleeding, dysuria + systemic sx, or trouble passing urine.  

Follow up:  
Review 3–4 wks: check shoudler sx + function, review XR + urine results, chase urology appt.  
Pt reassured but says doesn’t want to be “a bother” – encouraged to come back even if “only a bit better but not right”.  

[Addded later 22/11/25 16:10 – Dr K]  
Urine sample taken and sent for MCS + cytolgy today.
