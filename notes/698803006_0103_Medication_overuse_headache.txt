Recurrent headaches known migraine  
"Headaches come back when the painkillers wear off"  

Hx  
Long Hx migraine since late teens previously 1–2/mth R sided throbbing assoc photophobia nausea relieved by sumatriptan  
Last 4–5/12 now headaches most days  
Describes baseline dull band like ache most days with superimposed typical migraine 1–2/7  
Using OTC paracetamol 1 g + ibuprofen 400 mg most days "pretty much every day after lunch" often again at night est ≥20 days/mth  
Sumatriptan 50 mg ~8–10 days/mth  
Says feels ok for few hrs after tablets then "as soon as they start wearing off the headache comes back sometimes worse" typically 4–6h post dose  
Pattern wakes with mild headache several mornings/week takes analgesia mid morning → improves → returns late arvo / evening  
Nil thunderclap onset nil worst ever headache nil focal neuro sx nil speech disturbance nil limb weakness nil visual loss nil fever nil neck stiffness nil head trauma nil seizures nil personality change nil wt loss nil nocturnal headache waking her  
Character of migraine otherwise unchanged just ↑freq + background daily pain  

Sleep 6–7h/night often broken by young kids (5 and 8 yrs)  
Caffeine 2–3 coffees/day pt wonders if "too much coffee" or "staring at the screen in that terrible office lighting" making things worse  
Mood feels "abit worn down" by constant pain denies pervasive low mood anhedonia anxiety attacks SI nil  
On COCP regular cycles nil ?preg  

PMHx  
Migraine without aura  
Nil signif med or surg Hx otherwise nil known depn/anx dx  

Meds  
Paracetamol 1 g up to q6h PRN currently 2–3 doses most days

Impression / Dx  
1 Medication overuse headache 2° frequent simple analgesic + triptan use on background migraine without aura  
   - Headache ≥15 days/mth heavy paracetamol/NSAID use most days triptan use near threshold clear rebound pattern as analgesic effect wears off  
   - Nil red flags nil focal signs so low suspicion intracranial bleed mass infection  
2 High frequency migraine suboptimally controlled due to MOH  
3 Psychosocial stressors work + parenting contributing to pain burden ↑analgesic use mood currently ok but at risk depn/anx  

Differential considered  
- Chronic migraine without MOH → likely co existing but pattern strongly suggestive of MOH  
- Cervicogenic headache → less likely given migrainous features normal neck exam  
- Intracranial space occupying lesion SAH meningitis/encephalitis → unlikely given chronic stable pattern normal exam nil systemic sx  

Plan  

Education  
Discussed dx of medication overuse headache explained frequent paracetamol/ibuprofen + triptan use perpetuating daily headache and rebound  
Reassured nil features today to suggest tumour bleed infection explained brain imaging not routinely indicated at this stage will reconsider if new red flags or fails to improve after withdrawal  
Acknowledged concern re caffeine screen time advised may contribute but MOH likely main driver  
Warned headaches may ↑ temporarily during withdrawal over 1–2/52 encouraged persevere  
Pt asked "Should I be worried about these side effects" re proposed meds and "How long until things start to settle" answered and provided written info on MOH + migraine  

1 Preventive therapy  
Start propranolol 10 mg PO BD for 1/52 then ↑ to 20 mg BD if tolerated  
Rationale migraine prophylaxis esp during analgesic withdrawal  
Discussed common AEs fatigue light headedness cold peripheries vivid dreams  
Checked contra indications nil asthma nil bradycardia nil hypotension today  
Advise continue at least 6–8/52 before judging full effect PBS script provided  

2 Analgesic withdrawal strategy  
Plan graded reduction over 2/52  
Week 1  
- Limit paracetamol to max 1 g BD on ≤10 days/mth  
- Cease routine ibuprofen use only if absolutely necessary and not daily  
Week 2  
- Aim most days without simple analgesics  

Bridging  
Naproxen MR 750 mg PO mane with food x5/7 in first wk then 3/7 in wk2 then stop  
Avoid other NSAIDs concurrently caution GI upset advised to seek r/v if black stools abdo pain  
Nil Hx PUD renal disease anticoagulants  

Acute migraine  
Continue sumatriptan 50 mg at onset may repeat once after 2h max 100 mg/24h restrict use to <10 days/mth  
Emphasised total simple analgesic use paracetamol/NSAIDs <15 days/mth long term to avoid recurrent MOH  

3 Non pharm  
Headache diary for freq severity triggers med use  
Sleep hygiene regular meals hydration moderate caffeine 1–2 coffees/day avoid sudden caffeine withdrawal  
Encouraged reg breaks from screen @work q45–60 min adjust monitor/lighting where possible  
Briefly touched on stress mgmt relaxation apps mindfulness time limited today  

4 Investigations  
No immediate imaging indicated given typical Hx chronic course normal neuro exam absence red flags  
Plan baseline bloods in context frequent NSAID/analgesic use  
- FBC U&E eGFR LFT ordered to local pathology (S&N) results via HealthLink  
Pt may attend nurse for bloods later this wk  

Safety net  
Red flags discussed sudden severe worst ever headache new neuro sx visual or speech change limb weakness confusion fever neck stiffness persistent vomiting change in personality → attend ED or call 000  
Advise earlier r/v if headaches much worse after 1 wk of withdrawal or intolerable SE from propranolol or naproxen or any concern  

F/U  
R/V 2/52 to assess  
- Tolerance propranolol naproxen  
- Reduction in analgesic use  
- Change in headache freq/intensity  
Consider ↑ propranolol dose further or alt prophylaxis eg topiramate amitriptyline if inadequate response or SE  
If ongoing high triptan/simple analgesic use at 4–6/52 consider neuro / headache clinic ref
