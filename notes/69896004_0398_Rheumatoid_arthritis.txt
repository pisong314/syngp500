Assessment  
1 RA seropositive longstanding clinically stable low–mod activity AM stiffness up to 60min tolerable pain nil flare today  
2 MTX monitoring overdue >6/12 needs 3/12 bloods ongoing  
3 Analgesia conservative NSAID use needs counselling re GI CV risk prefer PCM  
4 RA ↑CV + bone risk not fully addressed today  

Plan  

# RA / meds  
- Continue MTX 20mg weekly as per rheum  
- Continue folic acid 5mg weekly separate day  

Scripts today  
- Methotrexate 10mg tabs take 20mg (2 tabs) PO once weekly qty 24 rpt x1 PBS  
- Folic acid 5mg tabs 1 tab PO once weekly qty 12 rpt x1  
- Paracetamol 500mg tabs 1–2 tabs up to QID PRN pain max 4g/24h qty 100 rpt x2  

Analgesia  
- Advised PCM first line on worse days  
- Ibuprofen to use sparingly lowest effective dose with food avoid if indigestion persistent or any black stools or vomit blood → urgent r/v  

# Monitoring  
Pathology forms given today  
- FBC  
- U&E eGFR  
- LFTs  
- ESR CRP  

Plan 3‑monthly monitoring while on MTX or as per rheum copy results to rheum clinic  

# Education / safety net  
Explained her “abit stiff” still relevant for RA control encouraged to report ↑pain swell ↓fn early rather than just putting up with it  
Weather may aggravate sx but underlying inflam from RA  
Encouraged gentle activity hand/foot exercises heat packs if helpful  

Safety net  
- Seek urgent care / ED if  
  - Sudden severe pain swell in single joint esp hot red  
  - New fevers wt loss night sweats feeling very crook  
  - New SOB chest pain neuro sx or bowel bladder change  
- Also standard advice to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain or confusion  

# Preventive / chronic Dz (brief today)  
Mentioned ↑CV risk in RA and bone health need BP lipids vax review ?DEXA esp given chronic inflam + NSAID use  
Pt initially “I’m fine really don’t fuss” but agreed to longer chronic disease appt with nurse + GP next couple of mths  

Follow up  
- GP r/v 3/12 to check sx + bloods or earlier if deterioration or abn results  
- Already booked rheum appt ~2/12 asked to take latest bloods to that  
- Longer chronic disease / prevention review to be booked when suits pt  

Time  
Standard ~15min consult mainly scripts + MTX safety monitoring rest deferred
