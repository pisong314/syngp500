Telehealth consult tel  
Bulk billed metro GP clinic  

Reason for consult  
Rectal lumps and bleeding ?haemorrhoids ?need surgery  

HPI  
42yo male warehouse storeperson first presentation to this clinic  
Poor historian timing vague hx keeps changing details  

C/O "lumps coming out of my bum when I go to the toilet" present for "ages maybe a couple of months or longer" later "started this year sometime" so duration ~several mths  
Prolapsing tissue with BMs they come out on straining pt manually reduces in shower  
Intermittent bright red blood on paper + sometimes in bowl not mixed in stool  
Mild–mod discomfort itch perianal worse after multiple wipes or sitting long periods  

Nil constant severe anal pain  
Nil hx tense tender lump at anal margin  
Nil melaena nil clots nil mucus in stool when pressed initially said "maybe slimy" then denied  
Bowels usually daily but variable sometimes constipated then other days x2 BMs  
Admits straining "a fair bit" stool often hard at start then softer  
Often sits on toilet >10min scrolling on phone  
Nil abdo pain nil nocturnal diarrhoea nil wt loss nil fevers  

Pt theories forklift sitting work toilets coffee etc discussed more likely 2° straining low fibre  

Prior hx  
Told had "piles" a few yrs ago by unknown GP ?given cream or suppository details unclear  
Unsure if ever had banding initially says maybe banding then later thinks only cream  
Nil known personal or FHx bowel ca IBD coeliac  
Never had colonoscopy FIT kits usually discarded  

PMHx  
Pt denies major medical problems records here empty  
Hx reflux uses OTC "heartburn pill" PRN ?PPI vs antacid  
Nil known bleeding disorder nil prev surgery recalled  

Meds  
OTC heartburn tablet PRN exact name unknown  
Nil other regular meds

Lives with flatmates some support cost an issue prefers OTC PBS/public options  

Systems review targeted  
Nil SOB nil dizziness nil palps to suggest signif anaemia  
Nil urinary sx  
Nil perianal discharge pus or systemic fevers  

Exam  
Telehealth only no physical exam possible  
Explained limitation unable to grade haemorrhoids or exclude other anorectal/colorectal pathology without in person perineal + DRE +/- anoscopy pt aware  

Impression / DDx  
Based on hx likely internal haemorrhoids grade II–III  
Most consistent with prolapsing internal haemorrhoids requiring manual reduction with intermittent BRBPR  
Contributing factors constipation straining low fibre low fluid prolonged time on toilet  

DDx discussed  
- Thrombosed external haemorrhoid less likely no acute severe pain no tense perianal lump  
- Anal fissure less likely as pain mild itch more prominent  
- Colorectal malignancy lower suspicion age 42 nil red flag wt loss abdo pain change to diarrhoea but cannot exclude without exam + further Ix esp given rectal bleeding and absent screening  
- IBD less likely nil diarrhoea abdo pain systemic sx  
- Rectal polyp / other anorectal lesion also ?  

Dx (provisional)  
1 Suspected internal haemorrhoids with prolapse intermittent BRBPR likely grade II–III (70153002)  
2 Constipation / straining 2° low fibre ↓fluid prolonged toileting  
3 Limited reliability of hx requires face to face r/v  

Plan  

Immediate / safety net  
Discussed telehealth limitations rectal bleeding needs physical assessment esp as recurrent and no prior documented work up  
Red flag advice given attend ED if  
- Heavy bleeding eg bowl full ongoing clots  
- Dizziness presyncope SOB palps severe fatigue  
- Sudden onset severe anal pain with tense lump  
- Fever or purulent discharge or rapid worsening pain  

In person r/v  
Advised earliest face to face appt within 1–2/52  
Plan at r/v  
- General obs incl BP HR wt  
- Perineal inspection DRE  
- Anoscopy if available  
- Assess pallor for anaemia  

Pt says will attend when not on shift reminded to mention rectal bleeding to reception for priority  

Conservative mx discussed first line  
- ↑dietary fibre gradually aim ~25–30g/d wholegrains fruit veg legumes  
- ↑water ~2L/d reduce energy drinks coffees where able  
- Bowel habits avoid straining avoid prolonged sitting on toilet "no scrolling on phone" respond to natural urge do not force BMs  
- Gentle perianal hygiene avoid harsh wiping can use soft paper or moistened wipes pat dry  
- Warm water sitz baths or warm shower to area after BMs if possible  

Meds (OTC for now no scripts issued today)  
- Suggested psyllium husk or similar bulk forming fibre daily with adequate water to soften stool ↓straining explained brief purpose  
- Short course topical haemorrhoid prep eg OTC ointment or suppository with emollient ± mild local anaesthetic ± low dose steroid for 5–7/7 for itch discomfort  
  Warned not to use local anaesthetic products long term due risk contact dermatitis  
  Cease and seek r/v if ↑pain new discharge or worsening bleeding  

Ix (planned not yet ordered)  
Given age 42 + rectal bleeding + nil prior bowel screening discussed  
- FBC iron studies at in person r/v if bleeding ongoing or if looks pale fatigued  
- Consider FIT vs direct colonoscopy ref depending on exam findings FHx clarification persistence of bleeding despite tx  

Pt preference currently to trial fibre + cream first understands that further Ix may still be needed depending on f2f findings  

Referrals  
Not yet  
Explained if persistent prolapse or bleeding despite optimal conservative mx will likely need colorectal or gastro ref for consideration of rubber band ligation injection sclerotherapy or other procedures pt open to this "if it doesnt settle"  

Other issues  
Pt briefly mentioned recurrent heartburn but due to time and priority of rectal bleeding advised separate appt for reflux and general health check add to problem list for future  

F/U  
Book face to face GP r/v within 1–2/52 earlier if appt available  
RTC earlier or ED per safety net above  

Time  
Approx 18min tel consult including hx counselling and safety netting
