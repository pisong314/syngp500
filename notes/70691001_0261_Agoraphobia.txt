A

P  
# URTI

- Symptomatic only  
  - Continue paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/24h)  
  - Continue saline nasal spray steam inhalation PRN  
  - If nasal congestion persists >10–14/7 can trial OTC intranasal steroid eg fluticasone no script given today  
  - Encourage fluids rest avoid irritants  
- Safety net  
  - R/V or ED if fever >38.5 >3/7 SOB @ rest or ↑ SOB pleuritic CP productive cough esp green/bloody sputum confusion or sx >2/52 not settling or any other concern  
- Reassured re nil signs pneumonia asthma pt said "that makes me feel beter"  

# MH – agoraphobia / anx / depn

  - Continue very limited diazepam 2 mg PRN severe panic aim <2–3 doses/wk nil early repeat  
- Strategies  
  - Reinforced breathing grounding ex  
  - Suggested gentle graded exposure once URTI improving eg short walks w partner brief quiet shop visits consistent w planned CBT approach  
  - Encouraged to keep upcoming psych intake discussed option telehealth if waiting rooms too triggering pt interested  
- Risk  
  - Nil current SI/HI good supports low acute risk given MH crisis contacts 000 ED local MH triage if deterioration  

# Ix  
- No acute Ix for URTI today given benign exam  
- Pt queried bloods as "seems to catch things easily" discussed low yield currently otherwise healthy young adult  
- Plan basic screening bloods FBE TFT Vit D lipids at later preventive/MH r/v when well not ordered today (QML vs SNP next visit)  

Follow up  
- GP r/v 2–3/52 for dedicated MH + preventive care or earlier if  
  - Worsening mood panic agoraphobia impacting work or leaving home  
  - Any SI  
  - URTI sx not improving 7–10/7 or red flags as above
