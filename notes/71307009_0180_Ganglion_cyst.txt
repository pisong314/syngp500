CC  
- "repeat script" + L wrist lump pain  
- multiple other minor issues on list – deferred (time). Plan long appt.  

HPC  
- L dorsal wrist lump ~6/12, slowly ↑ size, ~1–1.5cm, aching 3–6/10 esp after long typing/lifting files  
- No trauma. Full ROM, no locking, no paraesthesia, no weakness, no systemic sx  
- Seen A/H clinic ~2/12 ago – ?ganglion. Naproxen 500 bd prn helped. Wants repeat, asks "something stronger" + "can you drain it here?"  
- Uses NSAID ~2–3d/wk only, no GI/renal/asthma hx  

Other issues (not today – time)  
- HA (tension-type), R shoulder twinge, mole mid-back ?darker, bloating, sleep, "tight chest when I run for the train", toenail discolouration, "funny taste" mouth  
→ advised long appt 20–30 min next 1–2/52 esp for chest sx + mole  

PMHx  
- Nil chronic dz, nil surg, NKDA  
Meds: prev naproxen 500 bd prn (finished), OTC paracetamol, COCP from other GP  

SHx  
- Desk job, heavy keyboard/mouse. Non-smoker, ETOH social.  

Obs  
- BP 112/70, HR 76 reg, RR 14, T 36.6, SpO₂ 99% RA, BMI ~23  

Exam  
- Gen: well, NAD, talkative, list in hand  
- L wrist: small well-circumscribed fluctuant lump dorsum L wrist, ~1–1.5cm, NT–mild T+, overlying skin normal, no erythema/warmth. Transilluminates+. Full A/P ROM, grip = bilat, NV intact, pulses/cap refill N. No other joint swelling.  
- Brief CV/resp given chest comment: HS dual, no murmur, chest clear, no oedema, looks comfortable.  

A  
1) L dorsal wrist ganglion cyst – symptomatic, uncomplicated  
2) Analgesia/NSAID script request – intermittent use, low risk currently  
3) Multiple additional concerns – deferred, need structured review  

P  
1) Ganglion  
- Dx explained: benign cyst likely; may fluctuate/resolve; recurrence common even post aspiration/surg  
- Conservative: ergonomics at work, ↓ repetitive strain. Paracetamol up to 1g QID prn (max 4g/d)  
- Naproxen 500mg bd prn with food, short bursts only (≤3–5d at a time, not continuous). Avoid other NSAIDs, caution ETOH. PBS script given.  
- Procedure: discussed options obs vs aspiration ± steroid vs surg excision (hand surgeon). Not doing in-rooms today – time + infection/recurrence risk; needs planned procedure if pursued.  
- Imaging: none now – classic benign picture. If rapid ↑ size, ↑ pain, atypical features → consider US wrist.  
- Safety-net: RTC/ED if redness, heat, rapid ↑ pain/swelling, fever, new numbness/weakness, sudden change in character.  

2) Other issues  
- Explained standard consult length, prioritised wrist today.  
- Documented list for follow-up.  
- Advised long appt 20–30 min in 1–2/52 for chest tightness workup (hx, exam, ±ECG) + mole check + rest of list. Brief reassurance today – chest sx currently low-risk sounding but needs proper review.  

Billing: standard Level B, bulk billed.  

Review 4–6/52 re wrist or earlier if worsening.  
Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 1–2/52 long appt for other concerns.
