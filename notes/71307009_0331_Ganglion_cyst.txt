Plan  
# R wrist ganglion / pain  
Discussed benign nature usual fluctuation options  
– Observe conservative mx incl activity modification NSAIDs  
– Aspiration +/- steroid inj explained recurrence risk  
– Surgical excision if persistent painful functional impact  
Pt prefers avoid procedures "not great with needles will just stick with the tablets for now"  
Given simple written summary AVS due to poor recall  

# Meds  
EMR checked avoid duplication  
Script  
– Naproxen 500mg tabs one BD PRN with food max 10 days in a row 15 tabs 0 repeats

Paracetamol 1g q6h PRN (max 4g/24h) suggested first line naproxen for worse days  

# Non pharm
