34F review R wrist lump  

HPC  
Seen ~3/52 ago re ?ganglion R dorsal wrist  
Pt: “hasn’t really changed, just notice it more when I’m typing”  
Intermittent mild ache 2–3/10 after prolonged keyboard/mouse, yoga/planks. No rest pain, no night waking. No trauma. No numbness/weakness/↓grip.  
Concerned re “long term damage to the joint or arthritis” and “high recurrence if you drain it”  
No redness/warmth, no fevers, wt loss, other jt pains, AM stiffness, rash.  

Meds  
Occ ibuprofen PRN period pain only. No regulars. NKDA.  

O/E  
Well. Vitals stable (BP 112/70 HR 72 afeb).  
R wrist: ~1.5cm smooth round cystic swelling dorsal wrist over scapholunate area. Skin normal, -red, -warm. Mild TTP deep palp only. Mobile, tethered deep. +transillumination. Full ROM, mild tight at end ext only. Power 5/5, NV intact. No other lumps, no MCP/PIP synovitis.  

Impression  
Likely ganglion cyst R dorsal wrist – small, stable, benign, min sx. No red flags, no evidence inflamm arthropathy.  

Plan  
→ Reassured re benign nature, not known to cause OA/joint damage  
→ Discussed options:  
   - Observe (current plan, given mild sx)  
   - Aspiration ± steroid – simple but high recurrence  
   - Surg excision – lower recurrence but ↑risk, hand surgeon if needed later  
→ Conservative:  
   - Activity mod: avoid heavy WB yoga/push-ups for now, use wrist-neutral positions at desk  
   - Simple analgesia PRN: paracetamol 500–1000mg QID PRN; ibuprofen 200–400mg TDS PRN with food (max 1200mg/day OTC) – pt rarely uses NSAIDs, aware GI/preg cautions  
   - Can try soft wrist support with long keyboard sessions if helpful  
→ No imaging today – typical uncomplicated ganglion. US if change in size/character, ↑pain, or if proceeding to procedure  
→ Referral hand surgeon if ↑pain, functional impact, cosmetic concern, or enlargement – pt prefers “just keep an eye on it for now”  
→ Pt asked re “baseline bloods, inflammatory markers, thyroid” – not indicated currently in isolated typical ganglion, will review if new jt/systemic sx  

Safety net  
RTC earlier if rapid ↑size, new redness/warmth, sig pain, numbness/tingling, weakness, systemic sx.  

F/up  
Review 3/12 or earlier if wants US/aspiration/surg referral.
