57F postmenopausal f/up vag sx  

CC: ongoing vag dryness + dyspareunia  
Hx: known postmeno vulvovag atrophy + dyspareunia. Hx endometriosis (remote, lap dx in 30s).  
Still c/o pain esp penetration “burning, sandpapery” at introitus, a few hrs after. No deep pelvic pain now. No bleed, no abn discharge, no dysuria. Monogamous, low STI risk.  
Admits poor adherence “kept forgetting the cream then ran out” not used ~1/12. Thinks new washing powder + panty liners “maybe chemicals messing with it”.  

Meds: NIL regular. Previously oestriol PV. PRN paracetamol. NKDA.  
Smoker: nil. EtOH minimal.  

Obs: BP 132/78 HR 76 afeb BMI 26  

Pelvic (chaperone):  
Ext genitalia: archi normal, pale/atrophic mucosa, ↓labial fullness, no fissures/ulcers/lscl.  
Introital area: mild erythema, ↓elasticity, tender on stretch.  
Cotton swab: mild-mod tender post vestibule 4–6 o’clock, c/w atrophy.  
Spec: pale smooth atrophic walls, ↓rugae, scant discharge, no lesions, cervix NAD.  
Bimanual: uterus normal size AV, mild deep tenderness only, no masses, adnexa not enlarged. Pelvic floor slightly ↑tone, mild levator TTP.  

Ix: none today – low susp infection/malignancy, pattern unchanged. Offered self-collect swab → pt declined “just want to get back on the cream”. CST 18/12 ago NILM HPV neg.  

Dx:  
1) Dyspareunia – superficial >> deep, c/w postmeno atrophy. No red flags PID/malig/acute pelvic pathology.  
2) Postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy – undertreated (non-adherent).  
3) Hx endometriosis – quiescent.  
4) Non-adherence to tx contributing.  

Plan:  
- Restart local oestrogen:  
  → Oestriol 0.5 mg vag cream: 1 applicator PV nocte x 2/52 then BD weekly maint. PBS script + repeat given.  
  Brief disc re low systemic absorption, no C/I (no VTE, no Br Ca hx).  
- Adv avoid penetrative intercourse until pain improved. Ok non-penetrative if comfortable.  
- Vag moisturiser 2–3x/wk (e.g. Replens) + silicone-based lube when resume intercourse.  
- Irritants: avoid perfumed soaps/vag washes, minimise liners, change to fragrance-free detergent, water/soap-free wash only.  

Pelvic floor/psychosexual:  
- Explained pelvic floor overactivity likely contributing.  
- Referral → pelvic floor physio (pelvic pain focus) near home if possible.  

Adherence:  
- Discussed barriers (busy, forgetful, embarrassed).  
- Strategies: link cream to teeth-brushing; phone reminders esp maint phase; encouraged to request repeats before runs out. Pt: “I know I’m hopeless with meds but I’ll try the reminders”.  

Endometriosis:  
- No active sx. If new deep dyspareunia, abdo/pelvic pain, bleed → review, consider pelvic US / gynae.  

Safety net:  
RTC/ED if new postmeno or postcoital bleed, offensive discharge, fever, ↑pelvic/abdo pain, new vulval lesions/ulcers, rapid worsening.  

F/up: 4–6/52 long appt booked to review response to oestriol, adherence, pain, pelvic floor; consider swabs / pelvic US / gynae ref if poor response. Ask reception to send SMS reminder given past DNAs.  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed.
