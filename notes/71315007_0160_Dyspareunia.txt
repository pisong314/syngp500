Superficial burning sharp "stinging" at introitus with tampons + intercourse  
Sometimes throbbing pain hrs after  
Occ deep pelvic ache esp certain positions  
Avoiding sex most of time still occasional attempts with long term partner uses condoms  
Prev told by sexual health clinic has vulvodynia/vestibulodynia + hx PID ~18/12 ago treated OP abx no hosp  
Was advised pelvic floor physio + gynae r/v has not attended time + cost issues  
Now focused on "thick bit of skin" at front of vaginal opening worried it is leftover hymen tearing wants removal  
LMP 7 days ago cycles reg 28–30d mod flow nil IMB  
Nil current abdo pain apart from mild chronic pelvic ache nil fevers nil rigors nil dysuria nil abn discharge nil PCB  
Pt wonders tight jeans + waxing may be aggravating area  

Psychosexual / cultural  
Long term monog rel ~3yrs supportive partner intimacy ↓  
Feels guilty avoiding sex anticipatory anxiety before attempts  
Cultural pressure re hymen/virginity in extended family worried hymen "didnt break properly"  
Asked re sexual trauma denies

Non smoker social EtOH nil rec drugs

ICE  
Ideas pain due to thick hymenal bit tight clothes waxing  
Concerns may never have "normal sex" may need surgery permanent damage  
Expectations quick check maybe removal of tissue script for numbing gel

Gen well looking but clearly time pressured checking phone  

Abdo  
Soft ND mild suprapubic/low pelvic tenderness deep palp nil guarding nil rebound no masses  

Pelvic exam  
Verbal consent chaperone offered declined pt keen to be quick  
External genitalia normal labia maj/min nil lesions/fissures mild vestibular erythema 4–8 oclock nil discharge  
Hymenal tissue small crescentic hymenal remnant posterior introitus slightly thicker but non obstructive appears within normal anatomical variation nil active fissure nil bleeding tissue not rigid  
Cotton swab test marked allodynia vestibule esp 5–7 oclock + just lateral to urethral meatus pt withdraws "sharp burning" to light touch  
Single digit exam ↑ pelvic floor tone marked guarding difficult to advance finger deep palp limited by pain suggestive pelvic floor overactivity / possible vaginismus component  
Speculum only partially attempted pt very uncomfortable requested stop limited view cervix grossly normal from what seen nil obvious discharge nil CMT on minimal movement  
Bimanual not completed due to pain + time  

Ix today  
Self collected vaginal swab sent to SNP for NAAT CT/GC/M.gen  
Vaginal swab MCS requested to r/o candida/BV if lab accepts self sample  
Urine bHCG offered pt declined confident not preg using condoms + just finished menses refusal documented  
No bloods today offered full STI serology (HIV syph hep) at future visit pt agreeable "not today"  

Working dx  
1 Dyspareunia mixed superficial + deep chronic  
   – Superficial introital burning + +ve cotton swab + mild vestibular erythema → appears c/w vulvodynia/vestibulodynia  
   – Pelvic floor overactivity / guarding → likely contributing component ?vaginismus  
   – Deep pelvic discomfort with penetration + hx PID → possible element chronic pelvic pain / adhesions nil current features acute PID  
   – Hymenal remnant small non obstructive appears normal variant unlikely main driver of pain at present hymenectomy not indicated currently  

2 Hx PID  
   – Today nil systemic sx nil sig tenderness nil CMT as above nil abn discharge → no clinical evidence acute PID  

3 Vulvodynia / vestibulodynia known  
   – Persistent functionally limiting incomplete prior mgmt no physio limited use topical agents  
   – Needs multimodal approach but time/cost constraints significant  

4 Psychosexual impact  
   – Avoidance of intercourse anticipatory anxiety cultural overlay  
   – ?future benefit from psychosexual counselling not fully explored today short appt  

Plan  
Discussed findings briefly emphasised  
– Hymenal tissue looks normal variant not thick septate hymen reassured not something that "needs cutting off" currently  
– Pain likely 2° nerve hypersensitivity at vestibule + ↑ pelvic floor tone  
– Advised against forcing penetrative sex when painful may further sensitise nerves encouraged non penetrative intimacy  

Topical  
– Restart lignocaine 2% gel  
  Script given apply small amount to vestibule once nightly and up to 30 min pre potential triggers advised may sting initially wash off if sig irritation  
  If using before intercourse advised condom use to avoid partner numbness  
– Mentioned option compounded topical amitriptyline 2–5% for future if ongoing sx pt interested but wants to defer today due time  

Adjuncts  
– Strongly rec pelvic floor physio experienced in pelvic pain explained role in down training relaxation graded dilators etc pt receptive but concerned re cost/time provided names of local physios on AVS suggested ask re telehealth / less frequent sessions  
– Suggested reputable online resources Pelvic Pain Foundation Jean Hailes ANZ Vulvovaginal Society for self education  

Ix / results f/u  
– Await NAAT + MCS results will SMS/phone if abn treat as per guidelines inc partner mgmt if STI  
– Plan STI serology next longer appt pathology form to be done then  
– No imaging today if deep pelvic pain persists/worsens or new red flags consider pelvic USS + gynae ref sooner  

Referrals  
– Gynae ref discussed to assess chronic dyspareunia exclude structural issues (incl hymen concerns endometriosis) and consider further options  
   Pt keen but worried re wait + time off explained public waits can be months advised best to start process  
   Plan to generate detailed referral at longer appt after more complete hx/exam  
– Consider future vulval pain clinic if refractory  

Safety net  
– Advised urgent r/v GP or ED if fever severe abdo/pelvic pain heavy bleeding foul discharge sudden ↑ pain  
– Otherwise r/v earlier if unable to tolerate any touch or sx rapidly worsening  

F/U  
– Advised booking double appt 4–6/52 for  
  • Pain review response to lignocaine  
  • Attempt full bimanual if tolerated  
  • STI serology  
  • Discussion oral neuropathic agents eg low dose amitriptyline vs gabapentin including SEs  
  • Formal gynae referral letter  
Pt reluctant due roster/uni "will try maybe in uni break" encouraged online booking for double slot  

Issues deferred due time  
– Detailed MH/psychosexual assessment  
– Full endometriosis screen  
– Broader contraception discussion  
– Detailed chronic pain med options  

Plan discussed with pt who agreed  

Registrar: Dr ___  

[Supervisor addendum 22/11/25 16:10 – Dr ___]  
Case discussed with registrar after consult  
Agree likely vulvodynia/vestibulodynia with pelvic floor overactivity contributing to dyspareunia hymenal remnant described sounds physiological not primary pathology no indication for surgical excision at this stage  
PID currently unlikely based on hx/exam appropriate to screen for STIs via NAAT and arrange serology later  
Support use of topical lignocaine low risk and early emphasis on pelvic floor physio + psychosexual support appropriate though appreciate pt time/cost barriers  
Agree with safety net and plan for longer f/u and eventual gynae ref  
Management plan appropriate for brief consult
