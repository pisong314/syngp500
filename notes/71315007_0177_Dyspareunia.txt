Results from last visit reviewed  
- Vaginal swabs NAAT CT/GC/M.gen + MC&S incl Candida BV all negative  
- Urine MSU clear  

Nil new tests today no red flags exam stable  

Dx / Impression  
1 Dyspareunia likely multifactorial predominately pelvic floor muscle overactivity/dysfunction with assoc tenderness  
2 Pelvic floor muscle overactivity contributing to penetration pain  
Currently nil clinical evidence PID or endometriosis will monitor  

Plan  
Education  
Reassured pain is real common explained pain → muscle guarding → ↑ pain cycle  
Advised continue to avoid penetrative intercourse or clearly painful activities for now maintain other intimacy pushing through pain may perpetuate sx  
Discussed abx last year less likely direct cause given neg swabs no thrush hx advised to present early if itch/discharge  

Pelvic floor mgmt  
Referral pelvic floor physiotherapist womens health exp in regional centre sent today  
Discussed expectations focus on relaxation breathing posture internal release work if consents graded dilators later  
Continue daily pelvic floor relaxation diaphragmatic breathing "dropping" rather than tightening pelvic floor links given (Pelvic Pain Foundation Jean Hailes)  
Advised avoid chronic "holding" abdo/pelvic muscles at work micro breaks from standing if possible  

Pain mgmt  
Simple analgesia PRN flares post attempts or physio eg paracetamol or ibuprofen within usual doses  
Topical 2% lignocaine gel discussed as option if superficial introital pain persists after period of pelvic floor work agreed to defer for now  

Psychosexual  
Briefly discussed mind–body link expectation of pain anxiety → ↑ muscle tension  
Encouraged ongoing open communication with partner  
?psych referral or sex therapist if anxiety or relationship strain develops pt open if needed but not currently requesting MHCP  

Safety net  
Advised r/v earlier or urgent care if new abn bleeding esp postcoital signif change discharge fever worsening constant pelvic pain +/− positive preg test severe pain not settling  
Standard advice given re red flags incl fever >38.5C severe SOB chest pain confusion (generic)  

F/U  
R/v 6–8/52 after a few pelvic floor physio sessions or sooner if sx worse  
At next r/v reassess pain pattern response to physio consider topical lignocaine or gynae / sexual health ref if limited improvement  

Other  
Time limited today pt briefly asked if "bit crampy" periods could mean endo explained low suspicion currently based on hx/exam can explore further incl imaging and possible gynae ref in separate longer appt if non coital pelvic pain develops advised to book long consult
