Impression  
1 Faecal incontinence in context of known UC  
   Likely multifactorial  loose stool + urgency from mild disease activity and/or functional change + probable mild sphincter/pelvic floor weakness  obstetric contrib  
   Today nil features of acute severe colitis  nil evidence of faecal impaction/overflow  nil current red flag sx for ca  
   Health anx significantly ↑ distress  

2 IBD  clinically mild activity vs functional overlay  needs r/v by usual GP + gastro for full work up  limited by after hours setting  

3 Health anxiety signif  reassurance seeking  catastrophising around cancer and stoma  

Ix

Plan  
Resource context  
After hours metro clinic  limited access to imaging specialist r/v tonight  no direct booking for public gastro  will need GP to coordinate  pt has own transport  nil major financial barriers reported  

1 Education reassurance  
Explained faecal incont common in IBD due to loose stools + possible pelvic floor weakness  
Recent colonoscopy 18/12 ago reported as clear of cancer + nil wt loss or bleeding → current bowel ca risk low though still needs routine surveillance via gastro  
Re almond milk kombucha standing desk  advised may affect sx in some but not causing structural damage or cancer  
Validated embarrassment impact on work  

2 Symptom mgmt – conservative  
Diet  
- Trial ↓ obvious high FODMAP triggers (onion garlic some fruits wheat etc)  
- Simple food/sx diary  
- Start psyllium husk eg Metamucil 1 tsp daily with water  can ↑ to BD as tolerated  counselled re need for fluids  

Meds  
- Trial loperamide 2mg PO PRN for loose stool/urgency  
  Start 2mg 30–60min before times when toilet access limited eg commute teaching blocks  
  May repeat up to QID max 8mg/24h aiming for formed not hard stool  
  Stop if no BM >48h or signif crampy pain bloating  
  Advised not to use if develops PR blood fever or thinks having acute flare without med r/v  

Skin care  
- Zinc based barrier cream to perianal area BD and post episodes  
- Gentle cleaning thorough drying  

3 IBD f/u and further assessment  
Strongly advised early f/u with usual GP within 1–2/52 to  
- Confirm IBD subtype extent current mesalazine dose adherence  
- Consider FBC CRP UEC LFT + faecal calprotectin if not done recently  
Asked to contact public gastro clinic to bring appt forward if sx persist/worsen  
Suggested via GP/gastro  
- Consider timing of next surveillance colonoscopy given anx and last scope 18/12 ago  
- If incont persists despite stool bulking + loperamide  consider anorectal manometry + endoanal USS and pelvic floor/biofeedback physio  aware public waitlists may be long so GP may need to look at local private options vs telehealth if travel an issue  

4 Mental health  
Briefly discussed link between anx and gut sx  suggested MHCP via usual GP and psych input CBT style for health anx chronic illness coping  
Mentioned option down track of low dose TCA eg amitriptyline/nortriptyline at night for visceral hypersensitivity/anx but not started tonight as one off consult and need full med hx  to be considered by regular GP/gastro  
Encouraged limit random Google searching stick to reputable sites eg Cancer Council Crohns & Colitis Aust
