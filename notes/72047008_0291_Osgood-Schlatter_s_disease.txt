CC: R knee pain “just want to make sure I’m not stuffing my knees up long term”  

HPI  
~12–18/12 intermittent ant knee pain R>>L  
Gradual onset mid Y11 during growth spurt  
Localised tibial tuberosity, aching, ↑ with running/jumping/kneeling/stairs, settles w rest/overnight  
No single injury, no locking/giving way, no true effusion, no redness/fever  
Uses ibuprofen PRN, ice occasionally  
Mum encouraged review before Yr12 sport finals + summer job (fast food, long shifts on concrete)  

O/E  
Vitals WNL  BMI ~25  
Knees: no erythema/effusion, prominent tibial tuberosity R>L, mild STS over R tibial tubercle  
Localised TTP tibial tuberosity bilat, R> L  
ROM full, mild discomfort end‑range flex + resisted ext R  
Ligaments stable (Lachman/drawer/varus/valgus -ve)  
Meniscal tests -ve, patellar apprehension -ve  
Gait essentially normal, slight antalgic after repeated squats  
No NV deficit LL  

Imp  
1) Osgood‑Schlatter (traction apophysitis tibial tuberosity) R>L – classic hx + exam, no red flags  
2) High activity load – sport + prolonged standing on hard surface  
3) Diet/weight queries – reassured not primary driver of OSD, general health issue  

Plan  
– Explained dx briefly, common in active teens, usually self‑limiting as growth plates close, avoid pushing through mod–severe pain  
– Activity mod: ↓ high‑impact (running/jumping/deep squats) x 4–6/52, can cont sport if pain mild ≤3–4/10 + settles quickly, avoid kneeling at work where poss, suggest better footwear/cushioned insoles  
– Analgesia:  
   • Paracetamol 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/d)  
   • Ibuprofen 400 mg tds PRN w food short term only, counselled GI/renal risk  
– Ice PRN post‑sport/work 15–20 min  
– Quad/hamstring stretches daily – demonstrated, gave handout  
– Physio: discussed, pt agreeable but cost concern – given local physio details, no CDM/EPC indicated  
– Brief diet/weight chat only today – encourage more balanced diet, review later if wants  
– No imaging now – consider XR knees if atypical course / ↑ pain / no improvement  

Safety net  
RTC 4–6/52 or earlier if ↑ pain, swelling, locking, giving way, inability to WB, systemic sx → ED if acute severe  

Mum’s view: worried about “wrecking his knees” long term, reassured re prognosis  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed
