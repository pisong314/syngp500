CC: "rough itchy spots on hands + face want them frozen today"  

HPC  
Months hx multiple rough scaly spots dorsum hands/forearms/face  
Mostly asx until last few wks → intermittent itch/irritation esp w gloves/hat  
No pain, no bleed, no ulcer, no B sx  
Prev similar "zapped" ~3y ago by other GP  
Pt v keen for LN2 to all today "don’t want to come back"  

PMHx: nil sig, no known skin ca. No meds. NKDA  
SHx: outdoor work lifelong, high UV, reluctant to take time off  

Obs: BP 128/76 HR 74 RR 14 afeb BMI ~27  

Exam (limited – face/scalp/neck/forearms/hands only)  
Fair skin (Fitz II)  
Dozens AK‑type lesions 2–6mm erythematous rough scaly macules/papules on dorsal hands/forearms/forehead/temples/ears → sandpaper feel, non‑tender, no induration, no ulcer/bleed  
1 thicker ~7mm hyperkeratotic papule R dorsum hand, mobile, mild scale, no clear induration/tenderness → ?hypertrophic AK vs very early SCC in situ  
No obvious suspicious pigmented lesions in exposed areas  
No LN↑ (preauric/cerv/axilla)  

A  
1. Extensive actinic keratoses face/ears/forearms/hands 2° chronic UV (occupational)  
2. Thicker AK R dorsal hand – low concern SCC but needs close f/up  
3. High future risk NMSC / melanoma  

P  
Discussed dx + risk of progression, options: spot LN2 vs field Rx (5FU/imiq) vs derm if not responding  
Advised not safe/appropriate to "freeze everything" today given numbers, healing, risk missing SCC – pt initially unhappy but accepted partial Rx  

Procedures today  
LN2 x6 typical symptomatic AKs (3 x dorsal hands, 3 x forehead/temple)  
→ 2 freeze–thaw cycles ~10s each  
Tolerated well no immediate complx  

Wound care: expect erythema/blister/crust, keep clean/dry, no picking, RTC if ↑pain, spreading erythema, or not healed 3–4/52  

R dorsal hand thicker lesion  
Monitor – review 4–6/52  
If persists/enlarges/pain/ulcer/bleed → punch/shave bx and derm/plastics referral  
Red flags explained (rapid growth, non‑healing ulcer, new odd pigmented lesion) – advised urgent review not wait  

Longer term  
Needs strict sun protection + regular skin checks – offered long appt FBSE next visit (pt ok if early AM)  
Consider field therapy (Efudix vs Aldara) for forearms/face at review  

Ix: nil today – clinically AK, no red flags on limited exam. Dermoscopy/bx later if non‑resolving/suspicious  

Referral: pt requested immediate "skin specialist"  
Explained can manage in GP first, will refer if poor response or ↑concern / dx uncertainty / extensive field not responding. Pt agreed trial GP mgmt for now  

Safety net: RTC earlier if lesion pain/bleed/ulcer/rapid ↑size, new "ugly duckling", or systemic sx  

F/up  
Book long review 4–6/52 for:  
- recheck LN2 sites + R hand thicker lesion  
- discuss field Rx  
- more complete skin check (whole body – not done today)
