Reason for visit:  
Review – “numb feet both sides”, ongoing leg/foot pain, sleep distrubed  

HPI:  
52y M, forklift driver. Limited English, daugther interprts.  
3–4 mths progessive “pins and needles” and numbness both feet, now “up to here” (mid shin), R = L. Worse at night, wakes him, “burning on the soles, like on fire”. Also dull ache in calves, legs feel “heavy, tired”. No clear weaknes. No recent back injury. Hx long‑standing intermittent low back pain, prev MRI (regional hosp) – L4/5 disc protrusion with nerve root involvment per pt/daughter.  

Denies saddle anaesthesia, no bowel/bladder incont or retention, no falls. No known diabtes, B12 or thyroid issues. Rare ETOH only.  

Exam (focused):  
Obs ok, afebrile.  
LL power 5/5 throughout, can heel/toe walk.  
Reflexes: patellar ↓, Achilles trace bilat.  
Sensation ↓ to LT/PP in stocking pattern to mid shin bilat, symetrical. Vib ↓ at great toes, better at ankles. Gait normal. No foot ulcers, pulses palapble. No red flag back signs today.  

Impression:  
1) Distal symetrical sensory polyneuropathy – likely, predom sensory, stocking pattern, ↓ ankle reflexes. Need w/u for metabolic/nutrtional causes (DM, B12, thyroid, renal, liver etc).  
2) Known lumbar radiculopathy L4/5 – mild currently, pattern today more consistant with polyneuropathy than pure radic.  
3) Sleep distrubance sec to neuropathic pain.  
4) CALD pt, langauge barrier – daugher acting as interprter.  

Plan:  
Ix – forms given for SNP / QML today (fasting where needed):  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
- U&E, eGFR, LFT  
- FBC, ESR/CRP  
- B12, folate  
- TSH  
- Fasting lipids  

Meds:  
- Start amitriptyline 10mg nocte x 7 nights, then ↑ to 20mg nocte if still pain and tolerating. Warned re drowsy, dry mouth, “might feel crook and sleepy in the morning” – advised not to drive / operate forklift if groggy.  
- Paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN.  
- Ibuprofen only PRN, with food, max 400mg TDS, advised not to exceed without review.  

Red flags discussed (via daugther): if new leg weaknes, trouble walking, numb “around the bottom”, or trouble passing urine / incont, sudden severe back pain → ED/000.  

Follow up:  
- Review 2 wks for results + reassess pain/sleep + tolerence to amitriptyline.  
- Consider EMG/NCS and neurology ref dep on results and progession.  
- Longer appt next time for more back / work ergonomics if needed.  

Interpreter:  
Offered TIS phone interprter for next review – both agree. Note in file to book.  

Safety net: RTC earlier if pain worsens, new neuro sx, or med side‑effects.
