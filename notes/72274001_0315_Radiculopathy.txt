2  Reluctant engager w HC  tends to minimise sx  cultural factors  needs AHLO/daughter support in Mx  

Mx / Plan⇒  

1) Analgesia / meds  
- Restart amitrip 10mg nocte PBS  advise can ↑→20mg nocte after 1/52 if still waking w pain and tolerating  counselled re AM grogginess  
- Paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
- Naproxen 500mg bd w food PRN for flares up to 5/7 at a time  avoid continuous use  disc GI/renal/BP risk  
- Avoid gabapentinoids ?benefit low SEs ↑  opioids not appropriate for chronic neuropathic neck/arm pain  

2) Non‑pharm  
- Rec physio for C-spine stabilisation/posture  pt hesitant re "too many appts"  agrees if close to home  
  → ref to Aboriginal health worker–linked physio service (community based)  
- Adv relative rest from heavy overhead work prolonged driving but keep gently active  posture advice re PC/phone driving breaks  collar discussed but not Rx today pt prefers try ex first  

3) Ix  
- Given sx >3–4/12 + ongoing weak/sensory change  rec C-spine MRI to clarify disc/NR impingement r/o sinister  inform poss future surg options  
- Pt reluctant "I dont like those machines" "I dont want surgery anyway"  
- Shared plan  will reconsider MRI if nil improvement or any ↑sx over next 4–6/52  info sheet given  AHW to talk w pt/fam  No imaging ordered today per pt request but rec documented  

4) Safety net  
Expl to pt + daughter need urgent r/v or ED if  
- new/worse weak R arm/hand freq dropping objects  
- gait diff unsteady falls  
- new bilat arm/leg numb or peri-anal/genital numb  
- BB incontinence or retention  
- sudden severe neck pain esp + fever or trauma  
RTC if any of above or pain rapidly ↑  

5) Work / fn  
Offered cert/light duties  pt declined "I’ll just see how I go"  
Encouraged pacing microbreaks from driving/PC  suggested talk w manager re temp duty adjust  daughter to help advocate  

6) Cultural / supports  
AHW briefly in consult  will phone pt in ~1/52 to check med tolerance encourage physio and re-discuss MRI  
Acknowledged prior neg HC experiences  emphasised pt choice  

F/U  
R/V 3–4/52 or earlier if worse or new weak  
Next visit  repeat neuro UL  review pain/sleep on amitrip + use of NSAID  re‑offer MRI & check physio engagement  
Pt also mentioned feeling "more tired lately"  separate longer appt suggested for gen check (BP bloods incl BSL lipids etc) when ready
