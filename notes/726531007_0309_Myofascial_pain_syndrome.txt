Sleep mildly disturbed some nights due to discomfort but nil true persistent night pain waking her regularly  

Very health anxious today  
Has been googling a lot says "I’m really worried it’s bone cancer or some sort of hidden cancer"  
"Read that persistent pain is the first sign" wants "full body scans or at least some blood tests"  

Red flags  
Nil trauma  
Nil wt loss appetite ok  
Nil fevers sweats systemic sx  
Nil focal neuro sx incl weakness numbness sphincter change  
Nil CP SOB abdo pain headache visual change  

Pt theories  
New ergonomic chair at work "might be making it worse" pain ↑ after installed

Psychosocial  
Pt tense fidgety repeatedly asking "are you sure this isn’t something serious" "I just keep thinking they’re missing cancer"  
Brings printed web page on "chronic pain and hidden cancer"  
Engaged but repeatedly returns to fear of missed dx wants more tests  
Time tight today standard 10–15min appt flagged need for longer appt for anx mgmt

A  
1 MPS flare neck/shoulder/upper back dominant  
   Clinical picture stable vs prior benign exam nil red flags nil features to suggest ca inflammatory arthropathy or neuro dx  
2 Health anxiety / excessive health-related worry contributing to pain experience and frequent presentations  
   Prominent catastrophising heavy internet use  
3 Work-related posture ergonomics deconditioning perpetuating sx  

P  

# MPS flare  
- Reassured pt hx + exam not suggestive of malignancy serious spinal pathology or systemic illness  
  Explained absence of red flags normal obs benign MSK + neuro exam  
- Discussed whole body imaging not indicated may ↑ anxiety via incidental findings  
- Physical strategies  
  • Encouraged gradual ↑ activity start walking 20–30min most days + simple daily neck/shoulder stretches  
  • Adv short frequent posture breaks @work 2–3min every 30–45min  
  • Suggested review of workstation with OH&S adjust new chair rather than stop using  
  • Heat packs PRN  
- Analgesia  
  • Continue ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food aim lowest effective dose short term nil hx PUD/renal dz reported  
  • Option paracetamol 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h can use alone or alternating with ibuprofen to ↓NSAID load  
- If limited improvement next r/v consider  
  • Physio for targeted stretching strengthening posture retraining  
  • Myofascial / trigger point therapy  
  Emphasised active rehab > passive meds  

# Ix (for reassurance + screen)  
Pt strongly requesting "full blood work"  
Discussed pros/limits agreed limited screen only  
- FBC  
- U&E LFTs  
- CRP  
Explained aim to look for sig systemic inflammation infection other unexpected abn  
Clarified that normal results would support benign MPS dx and that imaging not indicated unless new red flag sx develop  

# Health anxiety  
- Validated pain is real distressing linked to stress muscle tension hypervigilance  
- Gently challenged catastrophic thoughts pattern consistent with chronic MPS not ca  
- Briefly discussed non pharm strategies relaxation breathing limiting Dr Google  
- Recommended long appt 20–30min in 2–3/52 specifically for anxiety coping strategies CBT style approaches  
  ?psych referral and MHCP at that time pt agreeable  
- Safety net  
  Advised urgent r/v or ED if new persistent night pain waking from sleep unexplained wt loss fevers neuro sx change in bowel/bladder fxn or sig change in pattern of pain  

Time  
Standard short consult today focussed on pain flare exclusion of serious pathology immediate mgmt  
More detailed chronic pain and anxiety work deferred to long f/u  

F/U  
- R/V 1–2/52 to discuss bloods reassess pain fxn consider physio ref and address health anx / possible MHCP (book long appt)  
- RTC earlier if deterioration or red flag sx
