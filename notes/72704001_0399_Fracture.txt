79F here re L wrist fracture f/up – “more swollen, more uncomfortable last day or so, need another X-ray + fracture specialist today”.  

Hx:  
- L distal radius # 10 days ago (minimal trauma fall at home, ED closed reduction + below-elbow backslab, told to see GP + fracture clinic).  
- Last 24–36 hrs notes ↑ swelling fingers/hand, pain 4/10 rest, 6/10 movement. No new fall/trauma.  
- Very anxious re circulation – “maybe the plaster is cutting off the blood”, also worried about how she’s been sleeping with arm on pillows. Mostly keeps arm down when watching TV.  
- No paraesthesiae, no numbness, no weakness, still moving fingers. Says looks “a bit more purple when I hang it down”. No fevers/rigors, no SOB/CP, no calf pain.  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g bd prn only, partial relief. No anticoagulants. Vit D 1000 IU od self-started.  

Lives alone, daughter nearby. Mobilises independently, uses stick outside.  

Obs: BP 136/74, HR 78 reg, RR 16, T 36.7, SpO₂ 98% RA. Looks anxious, quite insistent about imaging.  

Ex (focused):  
L arm in below-elbow backslab to MCPs, padding intact, not obviously tight.  
Hand/fingers mildly–mod swollen vs R but warm, pink. Cap refill <2 sec all digits, radial pulse present. Sensation intact median/ulnar/radial. Can flex/extend fingers + thumb, good power though limited by discomfort/plaster. No disproportionate pain in forearm, no severe pain on passive finger stretch. No blistering/skin breakdown/odour. Gait slow but steady.  

Imp:  
1) L distal radius # day 10 in backslab – ↑ swelling but NV intact, no red flags, likely dependent oedema / expected post-# course. No evidence compartment syndrome or infection.  
2) Recurrent falls / likely underlying osteoporosis (minimal trauma #, age, build).  
3) Marked health anxiety around fracture management / expectations of urgent imaging.  

Plan:  
– Reassured re circulation, explained swelling common at this stage, esp if arm kept down.  
– Elevation and regular finger movements discussed (brief).  
– Red flags given: ↑ pain not settling with paracetamol, numb/tingly/cold/blue fingers, can’t move fingers, severe pain with passive stretch → straight to ED.  

Analgesia:  
– Continue paracetamol up to 1 g qid max.  
– Discussed short NSAID course option if needed and no GI/renal/cardiac issues – patient ok to stick with paracetamol for now, review if inadequate. No new scripts today.  

Imaging / referral:  
– Explained routine re-XR usually done ~2 weeks in fracture clinic, not urgently today in absence of new trauma/NV compromise.  
– Pt unhappy: “Why can’t you just order what I’m asking for?” Discussed low likelihood of change in management today given stable exam.  
– E-referral sent to local public hospital fracture clinic/orthopaedics via HealthLink today – requested review 1–2/52, attached ED summary.  
– Advised: if not contacted within 5 business days to call clinic or return here.  
– Agreed that if fracture clinic appt >1 week away, will arrange follow-up XR L wrist then (QML) – to be decided once appt date known.  

Falls / bone health:  
– Briefly discussed this # as likely fragility fracture.  
– Ordered DXA hip + LS spine.  
– Path forms given for Sullivan Nicolaides: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca/PO₄, ALP, Vit D, TSH (baseline prior to any osteoporosis meds). Results pending.  
– Pt asked to “just start bone tablets now” – advised will wait for DXA + bloods first; she reluctantly agreed.  

Other:  
– Pt mentioned feeling “more tired lately” – deferred detailed workup due to time; plan to address when reviewing bloods/DXA.  

Follow-up:  
– Review 1/52 or earlier if ↑ pain/swelling, any NV change, problems with plaster.  
– ED if red flags as above.  
– Review 3–4/52 for DXA + blood results and osteoporosis/falls plan + fatigue.  

Billing:  
– Standard consult, bulk billed. 10:27 finished.
