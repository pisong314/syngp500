F/up re “stinging when I pee on the outside” + swab/urine results from last visit (5 days ago).

29F, on COCP, known hx “thrush every few months”. No diabetes known.  

Still c/o:  
- external burning when urine hits vulva, no suprapubic pain, no urgency, no haematuria  
- itchy/burning vulva, worse at night/after shifts  
- thick white discharge still there but “a bit less than last week”  
- superficial pain with attempted sex 2 nights ago, stopped due pain  

Very keen on “antibiotics for UTI” + “urgent gynae referral”. Declines STI screen today (“I just want this fixed”). No fevers, no abdo/flank pain, no abn bleeding. On COCP, not pregnant, not TTC.

O/E (brief):  
Looks well, afebrile. Abd soft, non-tender, no suprapubic/loin tenderness.  
Vulva: erythematous, mild oedema, excoriations, small fissuring post fourchette. Thick white “curdy” discharge on vulva/introitus, no fishy odour, no ulcers/vesicles.  
Speculum (limited): erythematous vaginal walls with adherent white plaques, cervix normal.

Results (from last visit, now discussed):  
- HVS: many budding yeasts + pseudohyphae → Candida albicans, heavy growth, azole sensitive. Lactobacilli present. No trichomonas. Minimal clue cells, whiff neg → no current BV.  
- MSU: dip last time trace WCC only, no nitrites/blood. Culture: no significant growth.  

Explained external dysuria from inflamed vulval tissue, not bladder. Pt: “But I feel it when I pee so it has to be a bladder infection.” Re-explained, showed neg urine result. Declined request for oral abx. No indication.

Dx:  
1. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (Candida albicans) – causing itch, external dysuria, superficial dyspareunia.  
2. External dysuria secondary to 1, UTI excluded on MSU.  
3. Hx BV – not active clinically or on swab.

Plan (agreed after some discussion):  
- Fluconazole 150 mg PO stat x1 (not pregnant).  
- Clotrimazole 500 mg pessary PV tonight stat.  
- Clotrimazole 1% cream bd to external vulva up to 7 days.  
- Hydrocortisone 1% ointment thin layer bd to external vulva up to 5 days for itch/inflammation (not intravaginal).  
  → warned topical azoles can weaken latex condoms; advised caution/additional contraception while using creams.  

No abx given. No BV treatment – no evidence currently. No gynae referral at this stage; advised consider if recurrent/persistent despite appropriate therapy.  

Advised loose cotton underwear, avoid perfumed body washes/irritants (new body wash likely contributing). Brief reassurance re toilet seats.  

Safety net: expect improvement over next few days; RTC if no better 5–7 days, if recurrent, or if new pelvic pain, fever, offensive discharge, bleeding, or typical UTI symptoms develop.

Follow-up: PRN, suggested review if recurrent episodes (≥4/yr) to discuss recurrent thrush regimen and possible referral.  

09:27 – Pt still unhappy re no antibiotics/urgent gynae but says will “try the tablets and cream first”. Documented refusal of STI screen today.
