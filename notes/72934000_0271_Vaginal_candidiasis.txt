A  
1) Vulvovaginal candidiasis – uncomplicated, likely C albicans  
   Classic itch + curdy d/c, exam c/w thrush, no red flags, low STI risk  
2) Health anxiety – ↑ health-related worry, catastrophising (“I’m scared it’s cancer”) in context housing/work stress  
3) Housing form – short-term condition only, intermittent sleep disturbance, no long-term disability  

P  
– Fluconazole 150 mg PO stat (PBS) rpt 150 mg PO in 72 hrs if still symptomatic  
– Clotrimazole 500 mg PV pessary nocte x1  
– Hydrocortisone 1% oint thin layer bd to external vulva only ≤7/7  
– Avoid irritants/tight clothing discussed briefly  
– Partner Rx only if symptomatic  

– Await HVS + NAAT → call/SMS with results  
– If non‑albicans / recurrent → consider alt regimen (e.g. nystatin, possible gynae ref)  
– If ≥4 episodes/yr → screen DM etc at later review  

– Reassured re very low concern for malignancy given age + hx/exam  
– Suggested longer appt later to discuss ongoing anxiety / psychosocial issues if she wants  

Housing form  
– Med section completed: noted current thrush causing itch, discomfort, ↓ sleep, ↑ anxiety, no permanent impairment. Advised condition unlikely to give priority alone; can review if mould-related resp/skin sx develop  

Safety-net
