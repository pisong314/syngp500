Hx: 4–5d vulval/vag itch + thick “cottage cheese” d/c. Says “feels exactly like last time”. Mild ext sting with urine. No odour, no PV bleed, no systemic sx (no fever abdo pain N/V, no true dysuria/freq).  
3rd episode ~12/12 (Jan, Jul, now). Jan HVS in file → Candida albicans, no BV, STI -ve. Good response previously to fluconazole 150 stat + topical clotrimazole. This time tried 2d OTC clotrimazole ext only → partial.

Exam (phone only): sounds well, speaking full sentences, no SOB, no red flag Hx for PID/UTI/STI by Hx.  

Dx:  
1) Vaginal candidiasis – uncomplicated, likely C. albicans, ABx trigger. 3rd episode this yr → monitor for recurrent pattern (≥4/yr).  
2) Contraception – stable COCP, not main focus today.  

Mx:  
- Fluconazole 150 mg PO stat today (PBS)  
- May rpt 150 mg PO in 72h PRN if partial response (script + instructions)  
- Adv ext clotrimazole cream bd–tds up to 7/7 PRN itch (OTC)  
- Avoid in preg – pt denies preg risk, adherent COCP  
- Basic vulval care briefly discussed (loose cotton, avoid perfumed wash etc – very brief)  

No Ix today – prev HVS-confirmed C. albicans, clear ABx trigger, uncomplicated, telehealth.  
If further episode in next 3–6/12 or poor response → F2F, HVS + bloods (incl BGL/HbA1c) then consider suppressive regimen / gynae if recurrent.  

Safety-net: RTC/F2F 3–5d if no better or earlier if ↑pain, swelling, fissures, fever, abdo/pelvic pain, offensive odour, new dysuria/bleeding.  

Pt q: “Should I be worried about taking this too often?” → reassured OK intermittently in healthy non-preg, discussed common AEs briefly, to seek review if any unusual sx.  
Partner: if penile itch → advised he should see own GP; topical azole +/- mild steroid usually adequate.  

Plan: review PRN, longer F2F in 3–6/12 for contraception/recurrent thrush workup if more episodes.
