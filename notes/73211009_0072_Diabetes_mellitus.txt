57M, known DM (likely T2, on tabs only per daughter) – urgent review  

CC: “Sugar very high – worried ketoacidosis” (daughter interpreting)  

HPC  
Daughter: 3–4/7 ↑thirst, ↑nocturia, very tired. Home BSL “HI” x2 days. Nausea + 1x vomit this am. ↓appetite, mild gen abdo discomfort. Mild SOB “a bit puff”. No CP, no focal neuro sx. No clear infx source (mild “cold” last wk). Misses “night diabetes tablet” when on long haul. No prev DKA.  

Pt: “drink water all time… wee all night… sugar too high maybe from energy drinks”. Limited Eng, relies on daughter.  

O/E (limited – time critical)  
BP 96/62  
HR 112 reg  
RR 22  
T 37.4  
SpO₂ 98% RA  

Looks dry, tired. Dry mucous membranes. Ketotic/fruity breath. Talking in short phrases but A+O, GCS 15, slow to answer. Mild gen abdo tenderness, no guarding. Chest clear, HS dual, no murmur. No focal neuro deficit.  

POC  
Cap BSL: “HI” (>27.8)  
Cap ketones: 4.5 mmol/L  
Urine dip: ++glucose, ++ketones, nitrite/leucs -ve  

Impression  
→ Suspected DKA in adult w poorly controlled DM  
Features: BSL “HI”, ketones 4.5, dehydration, mild hypotension, tachy, abdo pain, N/V, polyuria/polydipsia, ketotic breath. Life-threatening – needs ED now  
DM type not fully clarified – prob T2 on metformin only. Chronic care deferred.  

Plan  
– Explained in simple terms to pt + daughter: “sugar very very high, body making acid, dangerous → hospital now”. Pt repeats back “Go hospital now, drip, fix sugar”  
– No driving (truck) – unsafe. Daughter to accompany  
– Cannula 18G R AC in rooms. 0.9% NaCl 500 mL IV started (after phone discussion with on-call ED reg) while awaiting ambulance  
– Obs monitored – remained hypotensive borderline but stable, tachycardic  

Transfer  
– 000 called – urgent transfer to nearest tertiary ED w ICU / endo  
– Verbal handover to ED: 57M, known DM on tabs, ?T2, suspected DKA. BSL “HI”, cap ketones 4.5, BP 96/62, HR 112, dehydrated, N/V, mild abdo pain, no obvious sepsis focus  
– Suggested ED ix (not done here – time/limits): VBG (pH, HCO₃⁻, AG), UEC, creat, serum osmolality, serum ketones/β-OHB, FBC, CRP, cultures if indicated, ECG, CXR PRN, HbA1c  
– Printed brief summary + POC results sent with pt (see ED letter – DKA protocol requested)  

F/up  
– GP review 3–5/7 post-discharge (double appt) – daughter to book  
– To review hosp summary, confirm DM type, new regimen (likely insulin), driving fitness etc  

Safety  
– Emphasised can be life-threatening if no hosp tx. Both acknowledge.  
– RTC / call if any issues post-discharge (discuss at f/up)  

(Prev DM review 2023 – HbA1c not in file – will chase from QML at follow-up)
