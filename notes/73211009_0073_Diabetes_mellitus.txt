Assessment  
1 Impending DKA risk  insulin dep DM with hyperglycaemia and ↑blood ketones 1.8  mild dehydration only haemodynamically stable nil abdo pain nil V nil Kussmaul nil AMS  does not currently meet DKA criteria but in high risk sick day window  
Likely 2° relative insulin deficiency from ↓rapid insulin last 2/7 +/- early viral illness  nil clear infective focus O/E today  
2 Insulin dep DM ?T1 chronic overall control appears reasonable per pt but recent 24h suboptimal  need records for HbA1c trend  
3 Coeliac disease stable GF diet  

Red flags screened  
Nil abdo pain persistent V SOB Kussmaul confusion hypotension CP at present  

Plan  
Acute today  
Discussed seriousness of ↑ketones risk of DKA sick day rules reinforced  
In rooms gave extra rapid acting insulin per her correction scale  NovoRapid 4u s/c documented in EMR  pt familiar with regimen  
Encouraged oral fluids sugar free regularly  

Observed in waiting room ~35min  
Repeat BSL by nurse 15.9 ketones 1.3 pt feels similar but not worse tolerating water  

Safety net  
Advised immediate ED / 000 if  
• V develops or cant keep fluids down  
• ↑abdo pain rapid breathing drowsiness confusion  
• Ketones ≥3.0 or >1.5 persisting >4h despite extra insulin  
• Feels "much worse" even if unsure  emphasised not a bother DKA life threatening  
Also generic advice return if fever >38.5 severe SOB CP confusion  

Pathology ordered today (non urgent but done same day if poss)  
UEC CMP  
FBC CRP  
HbA1c  
Lipids  
Urine ACR if not done in last 12/12 (no records visible)  

Chronic dz / f/u  
Need longer DM r/v 30min in 1–2/52 to  
• Clarify basal bolus regimen in detail adjust if needed  
• R/v SMBG ketone pattern  
• Foot check BP lipids renal eye checks thyroid etc  
• Coeliac f/u dietitian if needed  
Will request diabetes clinic letters last HbA1c retinal screen  

Education  
Reassured that coming in for ketones appropriate not overreacting  
Explained ketones due to relative insulin lack + intercurrent illness not gluten free bread  
Brief discussion workplace support hypo mgmt
