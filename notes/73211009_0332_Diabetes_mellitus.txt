Assessment  
1 Fatigue / subjective weakness 6–8/52  
Likely multifactorial T2DM suboptimal control ?thyroid under or over replacement probable OSA given loud snoring witnessed apnoeas non restorative sleep obesity plus high psychosocial load  
Nil features today to suggest acute cardiac neuro or metabolic emergency  

2 T2DM w obesity suboptimal control  
Random BSL 11.2 last HbA1c 7.9% high CV risk Aboriginal + BMI↑ needs updated bloods med optimisation  

3 Autoimmune thyroiditis on thyroxine control uncertain  
Missed doses + no TFTs for long time may be contributing to fatigue  

4 ?Obstructive sleep apnoea  
High suspicion based on hx will need formal sleep study
