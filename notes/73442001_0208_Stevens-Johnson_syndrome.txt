CC: vax review / update  

Hx: wants “top up on my vaccines – flu, pneumonia, shingles?”. Very vague hx re past vax + meds.  
Known severe cutaneous ADR – SJS vs early TEN ~8y ago likely 2/2 trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). Old hosp letter in file → avoid sulfonamide abx, no rechallenge, med alert bracelet. Pt recalls “skin peeling, in hosp for ages”. Unsure exact drug.  
No hx anaphylaxis to vax / eggs / gelatin / latex. Reports “felt tired for a week after a flu jab once” only. Multiple QIV 2020–23 here tolerated.  
No chronic dz recorded. No current reg meds except PRN paracetamol ± ibuprofen (advised previously to avoid NSAIDs around time of SJS – not fully adherent).  

Ex: afebrile, well, NAD. Skin clear, no rash. Chest clear.  

A:  
1) Immunisation review – adult, prev SJS to sulfonamide (not vax related)  
   - SJS is drug-related, not C/I to inactivated vax  
   - Well today, no acute infxn → ok to proceed  
2) Severe drug allergy – SJS to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole  
   - High‑risk; needs clear EMR flags + pt edu  
   - ?NSAID contribution noted in old letter but less likely  

P:  
- Confirmed: not pregnant, no acute febrile illness, no prior vax anaphylaxis.  
- Vax today:  
  → 2025 QIV IM L deltoid  
  → Shingrix dose 1 IM R deltoid (off‑label <50, discussed; not PBS at her age, pt ok to self‑fund)  
- Pneumococcal: not indicated at 42, otherwise well, no RFs → defer until older / if comorbidities.  

- Counselling (brief): SJS due to meds, not vax. Usual post‑vax SEs discussed. Stay 15 mins post‑vax. Red flag sx explained (anaphylaxis, severe rash/skin peel esp after any new med).  

- Allergy list updated in EMR:  
  * Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole – SJS (life‑threatening, DO NOT RECHALLENGE)  
  * “Sulfonamide antibiotics” – avoid class  
- Advised: always tell dr/pharmacist re SJS + “sulfa” allergy. Prefer paracetamol for pain/fever for now; avoid starting new Rx meds without GP review until allergy plan clarified.  

- Rec med alert bracelet “Severe drug allergy – SJS to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (sulfonamide)”. Printed allergy summary for pt (brief).  

F/U:  
- Nurse/GP appt 2–6/12 for Shingrix dose 2.  
- Book long appt later for detailed SJS / drug allergy counselling ± derm/allergy clinic referral (formal documentation, med avoidance list).  
- RTC earlier if rash, mucosal lesions, breathing issues, or generally worse.  

14:30 – observed 15 mins post‑vax, no immediate ADR.
