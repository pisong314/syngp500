32F RN f/up stress  

CC: “stress flared up again” + palps + poor sleep  

Hx: known work-related stress/adjustment-type picture. Last seen ~3/12 ago re same. Plan then: CBT, sleep hygiene, graded ex, very short prn diazepam.  
Past few wks 4–6/52 ↑work stress (short-staffed, double shifts, nights). Feels “on edge”, tearful post-shift, cancels social plans. No clear anhedonia. No ETOH/drugs. Caffeine now ~5 coffees/shift (was 2–3).  

Psych:  
↑worry re work performance, fears med error due to fatigue. Irritable at home, demoralised re job but says life overall “ok”.  
No h/o psych admit. No MDD/GAD dx.  
Denies SI / self-harm / psychotic sx.  

Somatic:  
Palps + chest tightness mainly pre-shift / in bed. 5–10 mins, settles with slow breathing. No exertional cp, no SOB, no syncope, no N/V, no diaphoresis.  
Tension-type HA + neck/shoulder tight.  
Sleep: sleep onset 1–2hrs, wakes ~3am ruminating. ~4–5hrs sleep on work nights → fatigue, ↓conc.  

Meds/adherence:  
Prev given very small qty diazepam 2mg prn severe anxiety (short term only). Used sporadically then “ran out a few weeks ago”, no early repeats, no overuse reported.  
Did not book psych (“roster kept changing”), missed last f/up (extra shift).  
No other psych meds.  

O/E:  
Tired but NAD, cooperative. Keeps checking phone.  
BP 118/76 HR 86 reg RR 14 SpO2 99% RA T 36.7 BMI ~23  
CVS dual HS, no murmur, no oedema. Chest clear. No focal neuro deficit.  

MSE:  
Mood “stressed, exhausted”, affect mildly anxious but reactive. TP linear. Content dominated by work stress, feels guilty requesting days off. No SI/HI, no psychosis. Good insight.  

Impr:  
1) Work-related stress / adjustment-type rxn – exacerbation. Distress ++ but still functioning at work. No current MDD/GAD, no red flags.  
2) Anxiety-related palps + chest tightness likely situational + high caffeine. No features c/w ACS/arrhythmia today.  
3) Shift-work insomnia / poor sleep hygiene.  
4) Non-adherence to prior plan (no psych, missed appts).  

Plan:  
– Focus today on stress/anxiety & adherence (short appt, running late)  
– Psychoed briefly re stress response, normalising sx  
– Strongly recc CBT as 1st line  
   → Pt agrees if booking done here: PN to assist booking psych before leaving  
   → MHCP to be done at longer appt 30 mins (book within 1–2/52)  
– Meds:  
   • No diazepam repeat today (concern re pattern + dependence risk)  
   • Discussed benzos short-term only, risks (sedation/driving/dependence)  
   • No AD started – sx consistent with adjustment, not clear MDD/GAD  
– Caffeine: advise gradual ↓ to ≤2 coffees/day, avoid late-shift caffeine, consider decaf  
– Sleep: brief advice re wind-down, dark room, avoid screens, esp around night shifts  
– Breathing ex taught (diaphragmatic) – pt able to demo, use during palps/chest tightness  

Ix:  
– No urgent Ix today – situational, benign exam, low cardiac risk.  
– Offered screen: FBC, U&E, TSH, fasting glucose/lipids + ECG baseline  
   Pt currently on break between shifts → no time today  
   → Plan to order at MHCP/next f/up when can attend fasting AM  

Risk/safety:  
– Explicitly denies SI/SH thoughts.  
– Safety net: if mood worsens, SI, or panic not settling with breathing → ED / 000 / Lifeline.  

Adherence:  
Pt acknowledges poor follow-through (“I know I’m bad with this stuff”).  
– Book MHCP appt before leaving (1–2/52)  
– Pt to set phone reminders for appt + sleep/relaxation  
– PN to call to rebook if DNA MHCP appt  

F/up:  
– 30-min MHCP appt 1–2/52: formal K10/PHQ-9/GAD-7, complete MHCP, send psych referral, review stress/sleep/palps & caffeine ↓, consider very short prn benzo course only if still severe and engaged in CBT.  
– Earlier same-day review or ED if acute deterioration.
