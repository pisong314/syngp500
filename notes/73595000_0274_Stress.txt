32yo F RN – review “stress / mood”  

Came in for f/u re low mood, says today mainly “feel like I’m a burden to everyone, they’d be better off without me whingeing”. Long hx MDD + GAD, drinks most weeks. Known patchy attendance + poor med adherence.  

Has stopped sertraline ~6–8/52 ago (“ran out and didn’t get more”), since then ↑ tearful, withdrawn, low motivation, fatigue, poor sleep (broken, worse after lates/nights), some wt loss a few kg. Work on busy med ward, lots of double shifts, feels guilty taking sick leave. Feels useless on days off when too tired to see people.  

Passive suicidal thoughts most days – “they’d be better off without me” – but denies plan/intent, no prep, no past attempts. Says would call Mum or go to ED if felt unsafe. No psychosis, no mania.  

Alcohol 3–4 nights/wk, usually 3–4 stds, sometimes 6–7 on days off “to take the edge off”. Aware not ideal. No other drugs. No benzos currently – agrees to avoid given alcohol. Heavy coffee esp nights (4–6 cups). Wonders if iron low again – very fatigued.  

Exam (brief): looks tired, in scrubs, tearful but cooperative. Speech nl. Mood “stressed, guilty”, affect low but reactive. Thought content: worthlessness, burden, passive death wishes only. TP logical. No psychotic features.  
Obs: BP 112/70, HR 82 reg, afebrile, sats 99% RA. BMI ~23.  

Impression:  
- Relapse MDD + GAD in context of work stress, shift work, and stopping SSRI  
- Passive SI, low acute risk but ↑ ongoing risk (severity, alcohol, lives alone)  
- Problem alcohol use  
- Likely sleep disturbance / caffeine contributing to anxiety; ?iron deficiency contributing to fatigue (hx borderline ferritin)  

Plan (limited time, mainly safety + restart meds):  

– Risk/safety  
• Explored SI at length – no plan/intent, agrees to seek help if worse.  
• Safety plan: if ↑ thoughts / can’t stay safe → ED or 000. Given Lifeline, Beyond Blue, local MH triage numbers.  
• Asked to contact Mum / trusted colleague if feeling at risk.  
• No large quantities of meds at home; advised not to stockpile.  

– Meds  
• Restart sertraline: 50 mg mane 1/52 then ↑ to 100 mg mane if tolerating. PBS script issued.  
• Discussed delay to effect, common SEs, importance of daily use.  
• Strategies for adherence – phone reminders, keep near toothbrush, link to morning routine.  
• No benzos prescribed despite request for “something stronger for the panic” – explained risk with alcohol and dependence; pt accepted.  

– Psych / supports  
• Brief supportive counselling today around “burden” thoughts and work stress.  
• Advised re-engagement with CBT – will organise MH Treatment Plan at longer appt; discussed option of online CBT (MindSpot/THIS WAY UP) given shifts.  
• Encouraged to consider talking to NUM re roster / overtime; offered letter if needed.  
• Suggested letting family know she is struggling again.  

– Alcohol  
• Very brief intervention only: linked alcohol to mood/sleep and suicide risk.  
• Set small goal: at least 2 alcohol-free days/wk, ≤2 stds on work nights. To review.  

– Tests  
• Ordered through Sullivan Nicolaides: FBC, UEC, LFT, TSH, ferritin, B12, folate, fasting lipids, HbA1c. Asked her to do today after shift if possible. Results via HealthLink – to review at next appt.  

Dx (working):  
• Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate–severe  
• Generalised anxiety disorder  
• Work-related stress  
• Problem alcohol use  

Follow-up:  
– Review booked 1/52 (std 15 min) – check mood, SI, sertraline adherence/SEs, whether bloods done, and complete/renew MHCP + psych referral.  
– Sooner appt or ED if any escalation in suicidal thoughts or development of plan/intent.  

Billing:  
– Level C mental health consult, bulk billed.
