Assessment  
1 Likely contact / irritant dermatitis flexor forearms neck chest  
Prob trigger new “eco” laundry detergent with background atopic tendency stress contributing to itch + sleep disturbance  
Extensive discussion re differentials including  
– Atopic dermatitis flare  
– Allergic contact dermatitis to detergent/fragrance  
– Irritant dermatitis  
– Less likely pityriasis rosea drug eruption psoriasis scabies serious derm or systemic allergic reaction  
Explained reasons rash pattern absence of systemic sx mucosal involvement or blistering makes severe allergy SJS TEN cellulitis etc unlikely today pt able to repeat back key red flags  

2 Psychosocial stress with pre‑existing GAD problem alcohol/cannabis use currently high subjective distress poor sleep but still functioning at work nil clear MDD at present  

3 Problem substance use alcohol + cannabis brief intervention today more detailed AOD assessment deferred due to time  

4 Multiple additional concerns “shopping list” pattern  
Shoulder pain mole on back period pain palps “weird taste” sleep problems iron check toenail change  
Explained medico‑legal + clinical risk of trying to cover all in standard consult requested long appt 30min to address systematically pt agreed though continued to ask “one more quick thing” redirected  

Investigations  
Nil immediate ix for rash clinically straightforward dermatitis  
Discussed option baseline bloods FBC U&E LFTs TSH fasting lipids HbA1c iron studies esp in context of stress fatigue alcohol use and pt request re iron  
Explained benefits vs deferring today due to time prioritising rash pt agreed to defer to longer appt  

Management  

1 Rash – probable contact / atopic dermatitis  
– Allergen/irritant avoidance  
  • Adv stop new eco detergent rewash bedding + recent clothes in previous non irritating detergent preferably fragrance free  
  • Avoid hot showers harsh soaps use soap free wash eg QV Cetaphil  
  Discussed rationale pt able to summarise back  
– Topical  
  • Rx Mometasone furoate 0.1% cream apply thin layer to affected areas OD up to 7/7 then alt days for further 7/7 PRN avoid face groin  
  Explained topical steroid use fingertip unit duration risks of overuse skin atrophy striae especially if used on thin skin pt verbalised understanding informed consent documented  
  • Emollient advised liberal use plain moisturiser eg QV cream/Cetaphil BD and after shower ongoing even when clear  
– Itch / sleep  
  • Suggested OTC sedating antihistamine nocte PRN eg promethazine 10–25mg short term only discussed risk morning drowsiness impaired driving additive sedation with alcohol cannabis explicitly advised not to combine pt able to repeat this back  
– Safety net  
  Extensively discussed red flags  
  • facial lip tongue swelling  
  • SOB wheeze difficulty swallowing  
  • rapidly spreading painful rash blistering skin peeling mucosal involvement  
  • fever >38 or feeling systemically very unwell  
  Advised immediate ED if any of above or if rash markedly worsens despite tx  
  Otherwise r/v GP sooner than planned if no improvement 5–7/7  
  Pt states understands when to seek urgent care  

2 Stress GAD sleep difficulty problem alcohol/cannabis  
Due to time only brief intervention today  
– Psychoeducation re link between chronic stress poor sleep skin flares anx  
– Introduced basic sleep hygiene limit screens regular bedtime avoid alcohol/cannabis near bedtime as can fragment sleep and worsen anx rebound  
– Discussed non pharm strategies breathing exercises mindfulness apps short relaxation pre bed  
– Discussed that benzos not 1st line esp with alcohol/cannabis and dependence risk pt had asked for “something to just knock me out” explained risks + current guidelines pt accepted plan to avoid benzos at this stage  
– Discussed option of re‑engaging with psych for CBT based therapy and MHCP at longer consult pt agreeable  
Plan detailed MH review incl formal screening tools ?DASS21 AUDIT‑C etc at long appt
