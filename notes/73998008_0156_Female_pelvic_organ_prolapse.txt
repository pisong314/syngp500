72F walk-in "mucus coming out down below"  

HPC  
2–3/12 ↑ clear→yellow vag discharge, mainly on underwear/wiping, no foul smell, no blood  
6–12/12 pelvic heaviness + dragging, feels "something bulging when I'm on the toilet" esp later in day / prolonged standing  
Needs to push prolapse back to open bowels at times  
Long hx bowel issues (IBS, constipation, FI) – not main focus today  
No dysuria, freq, LBP, fevers, wt loss, PMB  

PMHx  
Known POP dx by gynae yrs ago, declined pessary  
IBS (mixed), chronic constipation, FI  
No known gynae Ca / IBD / CRC per pt  
No regular GP  

Meds  
OTC fibre intermittently  
Occasional loperamide  
No HRT  

Allergies: NKDA  

Obs: BP 138/78 HR 76 RR 16 T 36.8 SpO₂ 98% RA BMI ~28  

Exam (focused)  
Abdo soft NT no masses  
Pelvic (chaperone)  
– Atrophic vulva, mild erythema  
– Spec: clear–mucoid discharge, non-purulent, no odour, no obvious lesions, cervix atrophic only  
– POP: cystocele + uterine descent ≥mod on Valsalva  
– Bimanual: small mobile NT uterus, no adnexal masses  
PR: ↓ anal tone, no masses, no blood  
Urine dip: NAD  

Impression  
1) POP (cystocele + uterine) mod, symptomatic – pelvic pressure + bulge + mucus  
2) Atrophic vaginitis – likely contributing to discharge/irritation  
3) IBS + chronic constipation + FI – longstanding, stable today, contributing to strain/POP  
4) No red flag features today but age → need to excl colorectal/gynae pathology over time  

Plan  
– Reassured re no acute infection / malignancy signs today  
– Estriol 0.01% vag cream: 1 applicator nocte x 2/52 then BD weekly ongoing (PBS) → advise RTC if bleeding  
– Start regular fibre (psyllium) daily + fluids, ↓ loperamide use (only PRN clear diarrhoea days)  
– No abx – explained discharge likely prolapse/atrophy related, urine clear  

Ix  
– Vaginal swab MCS ± BV/Candida/Trich sent today  
– Plan iFOBT / consider colonoscopy via public at later review (pt says last scope ~10y ago, normal)  
– Pelvic US only if new PMB / bloody or purulent discharge  

Referrals  
– Public gynae/urogynae clinic for POP staging + options (pessary vs surg) – to complete full referral next visit (time)  
– Pelvic floor physio referral planned next appt  

Advice (brief)  
– Avoid heavy lifting/straining, pelvic floor exercises, simple bowel habits discussed  
– Hygiene: water only, avoid irritant soaps/detergents, liners ok  
– Red flags: ED/urgent review if severe pain, foul/bloody discharge, PMB, urinary retention, acute non-reducible prolapse, severe rectal pain  

F/up  
– Review 2–3/52: swab result, response to estriol + bowel regimen, complete referrals, more detailed bowel/IBS review + screening  
– RTC earlier if worse  

Pt behaviour  
Argues re dx, insists "something is falling out" and that prior drs ignored POP. Reluctant but agrees to trial oestrogen. Some dissatisfaction re public wait times.  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed  

[Added 16:30 22/11/25 by Dr K. Lee – swab result]  
Vaginal swab: normal flora, no Candida, BV, Trich – no infection.  
Plan unchanged. Pt to be informed at f/up (no phone consent for results call documented).
