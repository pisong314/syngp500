32F teacher – new pt  

CC: “general health check” → mostly MH “I need something strong to calm me down”  

Hx  
Long hx “on and off anxiety and low moods” + told “probably mild autism” in past no records  
6/12 ↑ anxiety esp work “on edge all day then wiped out”  
Sleep poor – ↓ sleep onset, wakes 3–4am “mind racing about school” ~4–5h broken  
Mood “up and down” irritable, tearful at home, avoiding friends “too drained”  
Brief 1–2d spells “pumped and super productive” ↓ need sleep but still functioning no risky bx no clear mania  
No AH/VH. Occasionally feels staff “talking about me” but recognises likely anxiety  
Sensory issues (noise, lights) routines, “meltdowns” at home when overwhelmed (pacing, raised voice, slamming doors) no violence  

No SI/SH current or past “I’m not suicidal just exhausted”  
No ETOH/drugs (ETOH 0–2 std/wk). High caffeine 4–5 coffees/d “maybe it’s the coffee and the LED lights”  
Worried about job “harder to cope” occasional sick days for anxiety/sleep  

Very directive re meds: wants “something strong today like Valium” declines when explained benzos not 1st line chronic anxiety. Also pushing for urgent psych “this week” + “brain scan”  

PMHx: no sig med hx. Prev SSRI (?escitalopram) stopped after 2/52 due ↑ anxiety + nausea. No psych admits. NKDA  
Meds: nil reg  

O/E  
Obs: BP 118/74 HR 82 RR 14 SpO2 99% RA afebrile BMI 26  
MSE: well kempt, mildly restless, anxious affect, mood “tired and stressed” TP logical but circumstantial, no psychosis, no SI/HI, insight ok, judgement intact  

Ix ordered – SNP  
- FBC, U&E, LFT, CMP  
- TSH  
- B12, folate, iron studies  
- Fasting lipids, BSL/HbA1c  
UA next visit. ECG later if starting psychotropics  
Results pending  

Impr  
Probable GAD + depressive sx in context likely ASD / dev hx  
?bipolar spectrum less likely (very brief “pumped” periods only) → monitor  
Sleep disturbance + high caffeine contributing  
No acute risk. No indication for benzo or urgent psych today. No red flags for neuro cause → brain imaging not indicated  

Plan  
- No meds started today – discussed SSRI/SNRI as 1st line, past side effects, will reconsider once bloods back and longer MH review  
- Advised ↓ caffeine esp pm, screens at night etc (pt already suspects phone/coffee “ruining my brain”)  
- Non-urgent psych referral planned after full MHCP  
- MHCP: needs long appt 30min → booked 1–2/52 for MHCP + review bloods + formal scales (K10/DASS) + more dev hx and med options  
- Psych referral target psych with ASD/dev disability exp once MHCP done  
- Explained psych wait times & that “special fax” only for high-risk (SI/psychosis) – she not in that group  
- Safety net: RTC/ED if SI, can’t cope at home/work, severe deterioration
