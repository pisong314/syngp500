28F Aboriginal, new pt to practice. On DSP. Known dev delay/FASD + hypothyroidism per old summary. Old notes incomplete.  

CC: “general check-up” / “head up and down”  

HPI  
Mood “up and down for ages” – very vague re timing. Poor historian. Sleep erratic (up all night on phone vs sleeping all day). Low motivation some days “stay in my room, can’t be bothered”. Limited activities, mostly phone. No clear ↑ mood / grandiosity. No clear psychotic Sx elicited, denies VH/AH when asked but tangential. Gets “angry quick”, now mainly yelling/slamming doors, no current physical aggression reported.  

Suicidality: passive thoughts “what’s the point” but denies plan/intent, says wouldn’t do it as “Nan would be upset”. Future oriented (talks about own place / course) but reliability limited. No current S/H, no hx attempts disclosed.  

Past psych: vague hx “mental health mob”, ?tabs “for my nerves” and sleep. No med names/doses. Old GP summary: “mental health disorder” + “challenging behaviour”, no dx. ?past CMHT / NDIS behaviour support – no letters. No psych admissions in EMR; pt unsure “went to hospital once when I was going off”.  

Substances: smokes ~5–10 cig/day. Soft drink + energy drinks daily. ETOH “sometimes weekends” qty unclear, denies daily. Denies other drugs but reliability ?  

PMHx  
- FASD / dev disability  
- Hypothyroidism – previously on thyroxine mane, off “months or longer”  
- No known DM/HTN/HLD/epilepsy in old notes  

Meds (per old list + pt, adherence poor)  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg mane – no recent dispensing on MyHR  
- No current psychotropics listed. Pt thinks “meant to be on something for my head” but none recent.  

Allergies: NKDA (per pt)

CVS/Resp: HS dual, chest clear. Abdo SNT. Neuro grossly non-focal. Thyroid not enlarged, no tremor.  

MSE

Cog: dev delay, orientated to person/place, not date, poor recall.  
Insight/judgement limited.  

Ix ordered today  
- FBC, U&E, LFT  
- TFTs (TSH, FT4)  
- HbA1c, fasting lipids  
- Iron studies, B12, folate  
- Vit D  

A  
1) Dev disability/FASD + unspecified mood/anxiety d/o vs behavioural dysregulation. No clear acute psychosis. Chronic low–mod suicide risk, current risk low–mod but assessment limited by cognition/poor hx → needs close f/up + collateral.  
2) Hypothyroidism – off thyroxine for months, current status unknown.  
3) Obesity, smoking, high sugared drink intake.  
4) Complex psychosocial context (Aboriginal woman on DSP, lives w family, ?NDIS).  

P  
- No psychotropic started today – dx unclear, no collateral, baseline labs first  
- Safety explained in simple terms; if ↑distress/SI/aggression → ED/000. Gave local MH triage + Lifeline numbers written down.  
- Thyroxine NOT restarted yet (off for unknown period) → await TFTs then restart / adjust (likely simple once-daily, consider Webster).  
- Plan longer MH review 30 min in 1/52 for:  
  • review bloods + manage hypothyroidism  
  • more structured MH Ax, consider MH Treatment Plan (MHTP)  
  • obtain NDIS/behaviour support + family contacts (with consent) for collateral  
  • discuss smoking, contraception if time  
- Consider referral next visit: psych (via MHTP) with dev disability experience; local ID MH / CMHT if available; review of NDIS behaviour support.  
- Brief diet chat – ↓soft drink/energy drinks, ↑water. Exercise: short walks suggested.  

RTC 1/52 long appt or earlier if worse / safety concerns  

(Prev note says “Review 03/05/23 15/08/24” re thyroid – likely copy-forward from old clinic, not current)
