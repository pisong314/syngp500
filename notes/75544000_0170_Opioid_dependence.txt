Long Hx prescribed oxycodone for back and knee pain ran out "few weeks ago" now using heroin when can get it mostly smoked occasional IV last use yesterday am  
No clear plan to cut down using heroin + simple OTC analgesia for pain  

Pt own thoughts re eyes fan blowing on face at night cheap shampoo poss allergy to dog  

Background / substance use

Polysubstance use cannabis most days when can binge ETOH weekends intermittent benzos from friends  
Not engaged AOD services prev referrals DNA  
Nil known hep B/C or HIV screening previously offered not completed  

Chronic pain  
Mechanical low back + bilateral knee pain from prior construction work  
Today pain "8/10 most days" nil saddle anaesthesia nil leg weakness nil new bladder bowel issues  

Meds  
Currently nil prescribed opioids  
PRN paracetamol OTC ibuprofen erratic use  
Unclear street benzo use denies daily  

Allergies

unemployed unstable accom staying with cousins on/off limited income smokes ~10–15 cig/day uses public transport family support limited strained by drug use

Systems review  
Nil chest pain SOB fevers wt loss  
Mood ↓ at times SI nil "I just get over it sometimes but I’m alright"  

Exam  
Gen tired restless yawning fidgety mildly distressed cooperative  
Obs BP 132/78 HR 98 RR 18 SpO2 99% RA Temp 36.7  
Eyes mild bilat conjunctival injection profuse tearing pupils 4–5 mm equal reactive nil miosis nil ciliary flush nil corneal opacity VA approx 6/9 OU uncorrected gross exam incl lid eversion nil FB seen nil eyelid oedema nil purulent d/c EOM full non painful nil photophobia  
ENT mild clear rhinorrhoea nil sinus TTP  
Abdo soft mild generalised crampy discomfort nil guarding  
Neuro AOx3 grossly non focal  
Skin nil jaundice rash no obvious track marks forearms today  
Psych anxious restless partial insight recognises w/drawal when discussed ambivalent re treatment  

Dx / Impression  
1 Epiphora watery eyes most likely 2° opioid withdrawal autonomic sx given assoc rhinorrhoea sweats mydriasis restlessness recent cessation prescribed opioids ongoing heroin use nil red flags for acute ophthalmic emergency (nil severe pain nil vision loss nil marked photophobia nil purulent d/c)  
DDx allergic conjunctivitis irritant exposure dry eye less likely infective conjunctivitis (nil purulent d/c nil contact)  

2 Opioid dependence with current mild–mod withdrawal ongoing heroin use high risk context polysubstance use unstable housing no MATOD poor engagement hx  

3 Chronic mechanical low back pain + knee OA/overuse poorly controlled pt using heroin for analgesia perpetuating dependence  

4 Polysubstance use cannabis ETOH intermittent benzos ↑OD risk esp if starting MATOD  

5 BBV risk due to past IV use ?needle sharing status unknown requires screening hep B vax if non immune  

Plan  

# Eyes / epiphora  
Explained likely 2' opioid withdrawal expected to improve as withdrawal settles or with MATOD  
Symptomatic relief  
- Lubricating eye drops artificial tears 1–2 gtt OU PRN daytime  
- Avoid rubbing eyes minimise direct fan/wind exposure where possible  
Red flag advice given sudden ↓vision severe pain marked photophobia thick purulent d/c unilateral swelling trauma or chem exposure → ED  

Rx  
- Artificial tears ophth soln script given PBS OTC  

# Opioid dependence & withdrawal  
Discussed MATOD esp buprenorphine–naloxone as first line benefits re ↓craving ↓OD risk improved function vs ongoing heroin use  
Pt ambivalent "don’t want to be locked into another thing" but acknowledges current pattern unsustainable  

Assessed suitable for buprenorphine induction when in clear w/drawal  
Last heroin use yesterday am smoked nil recent long acting opioids reported appears mild–mod withdrawal currently  

Today  
- Provided education re Suboxone induction must start when in at least mild–mod withdrawal to avoid precipitated w/drawal  
- Urgent referral faxed to local public drug and alcohol / MATOD clinic same health district marked priority given polysubstance use unstable housing prior DNAs asked service to consider outreach engagement if feasible  
- Checked state RTPM nil recent opioid or benzo scripts past 3/12  

Harm reduction  
- Take home naloxone offered and accepted  
  Rx Naloxone nasal spray 1.8 mg use as directed for suspected opioid OD discussed signs unresponsive slow or absent breathing blue lips call 000 administer naloxone recovery position may repeat as per pack  
- Encouraged use local NSP single use equipment avoid sharing  
- Strong advice to avoid combining opioids including buprenorphine with alcohol or benzos due ↑OD risk  

Safety  
Nil current SI or psychosis provided crisis numbers and advised ED if feels unsafe  

# Chronic pain  
Explained pain and opioid dependence tightly linked MATOD esp buprenorphine may also help stabilise pain  
No opioids prescribed today given dependence ongoing heroin use pending MATOD  
Analgesia  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN max 4 g/24h script supplied  
- NSAIDs only short term PRN OTC advised but will need future r/v for renal GI risk before longer use  

Deferred detailed chronic pain plan to longer appt once substance use more stable (non pharm strategies physio pacing etc)  

# Polysubstance use & BBV  
Brief counselling re risks mixing heroin with ETOH benzos esp around periods of ↓tolerance eg during or after w/drawal or MATOD start  
Pathology ordered today via local lab (e.g. SNP)  
- FBE U&E LFT CRP  
- Hep B sAg core Ab sAb  
- Hep C Ab  
- HIV Ag/Ab  
Explained rationale pt agreed "if it’s just one lot of bloods" nurse to take bloods post consult  
If hep B non immune will arrange vaccine course at next visit  

# Engagement / adherence  
Acknowledged past difficulty attending appts and taking meds  
Suggested aligning appts with days already in area eg Centrelink family visits  
Encouraged phone reminders  
Documented pattern of missed appts and unfilled scripts emphasised need for supervised MATOD dosing via pharmacy/AOD clinic rather than take home meds initially  

Investigations ordered today  
FBE U&E LFT CRP Hep B sAg core Ab sAb Hep C Ab HIV Ag/Ab results pending  

Meds today  
- Artificial tears eye drops PRN  
- Naloxone nasal spray 1.8 mg pack  
- Paracetamol 500 mg tabs 2 tabs QID PRN pain max 4 g/24h  

F/U  
R/v 3–5/7 or earlier if deteriorates ideally after contact with AOD service longer 20–30 min appt booked to  
- reassess withdrawal sx and MATOD progress  
- r/v blood results arrange hep B vax if indicated  
- commence more structured chronic pain mgmt  

Safety net  
Advised ED if severe worsening w/drawal unable to maintain hydration uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhoea chest pain breathing difficulty new eye red flags or feels at risk of self harm  

Time  
Std 15 min consult multiple complex issues prioritised withdrawal eyes safety and AOD linkage other preventive care to be addressed future visits
