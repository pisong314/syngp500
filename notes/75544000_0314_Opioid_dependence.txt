Speech clear, oriented, sounds tired but not intoxicated. Denies SI, no psychotic sx  

A:  
1) Insomnia – multifactorial  
   - Poor sleep hygiene (late caffeine, screens in bed, naps)  
   - Bedtime anxiety / GAD  
   - Chronic MSK pain  
   - On stable bupe – less likely withdrawal/OD; no features over phone  
   - No strong OSA/RLS features from hx  

2) Opioid dependence – stable on MATOD (Suboxone 16mg)  
   - High risk if sedatives added / relapse  

3) Chronic LBP + R shoulder tendinopathy – mild ↑ with overtime, contrib to sleep disruption  

4) MDD/GAD – partial control on sertraline, situational ↑ anxiety re sleep, no current risk  

Ix:  
- FBC, U&E, LFT, TFT ordered via SNP (routine MATOD / SSRI / NSAID monitoring + r/o metabolic cause of fatigue) – results pending  
- Consider STOP-BANG next F2F if snoring worsens / partner reports apnoeas  

P:  
Insomnia  
- Non-pharm discussed briefly: ↓ caffeine (none after 12:00), avoid energy drinks, no phone/TV in bed, avoid late naps, simple stretches/heat pack pre-bed. Pt aware from psych, will revisit  
- Sleep diary 1–2/52 for review  
- Med: start melatonin MR 2mg nocte 1–2h pre-bed (PBS – trial 2–4/52). No benzos / no quetiapine / no other sedatives given MATOD + OD risk  
  → counselled: don’t ↑ dose, avoid EtOH + OTC sedating antihistamines  

MATOD  
- Continue Suboxone 16/4mg SL mane supervised – no change today  
- Reinforced avoid extra opioids / benzos / gabapentinoids / OTC “sleep” tabs (doxylamine etc)  
- Confirmed THN at home, partner aware of use  

Pain  
- Continue paracetamol reg (max 4g/day)  
- Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food, monitor GI  
- More detailed pain + physio/ergonomics review next F2F (time limited today)  

Mental health  
- Continue sertraline 100mg mane  
- Ask psych to focus on CBT-I / bedtime anxiety  
- Safety net: call clinic/000/ED if SI, marked mood deterioration, or breathing issues / confusion with any meds  

F/U:  
- Booked F2F ~2/52: review sleep diary, melatonin response, pain, mental health, MATOD  
- RTC earlier if insomnia worsening, daytime sedation, ↑ substance use, or any red flag sx
