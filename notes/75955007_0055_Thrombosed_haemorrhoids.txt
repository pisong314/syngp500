Reason for visit  
- R/V test results  
- Ongoing rectal pain thrombosed haemorrhoid  

Subjective / Hx  
42yo Anglo-Australian F office admin  
Well informed articulate  

1) Test results  
Had routine bloods FBE U&E LFT lipids fasting BSL TSH done last wk for general check  
Pt wants to go through "line by line"  
Noted MCV "a touch low" asking if "something that will cause trouble long term"  
Also asking if inflam markers were done wondering about "some underlying inflammatory process contributing to the haemorrhoid"  

Systemic sx nil  
No fevers wt loss night sweats appetite change  
Bowel habit stable normal frequency and form  
Nil per rectal bleeding apart from brief episode day 1 of current problem  
Nil personal or FHx IBD colorectal Ca  

2) Anal pain ?thrombosed ext haemorrhoid  
Onset 5/7 after hard stool and straining  
Describes sudden "really sharp almost tearing pain" @ anal margin now constant  
Worse sitting and with BM pain ~7/10  
Feels a "tender blue lump" at anal margin  
Trying warm baths OTC haemorrhoid cream minimal benefit  
No rectal bleeding now spots of BRB on paper day 1 only  
Nil mucus nil melaena  
Stools now softer ↑fibre this wk  
Nil fevers rigors abdo pain urinary sx  
No anal trauma nil receptive anal intercourse nil recent travel nil known STI  
Has read RACGP info online says "it fits perfectly with a thrombosed haemorrhoid"  
Asks "I know I’m past the 72‑hour window is there any point doing excision now or is it just conservative from here"  
Thinks long periods sitting for end of month reporting may have "compromised venous return" also wonders if new standing desk switching sitting/standing has contributed  
Analgesia paracetamol 1 g up to TDS PRN partial relief avoiding NSAIDs as read "can ↑bleeding risk"  

PMHx

Exam  
Obs BP 118/74 HR 76 reg RR 14 Temp 36.7°C BMI 24  
Gen well appearing mild discomfort esp sitting conversant good insight  
Abdo soft NT no masses no organomegaly  
Perianal exam (chaperone present consent obtained)  
Right lateral anal margin ~1.5–2 cm tense bluish exquisitely tender swelling c/w thrombosed ext haemorrhoid perianal haematoma  
Overlying skin intact nil ulceration necrosis discharge  
Nil surrounding erythema or induration no features of perianal abscess or cellulitis  
Nil other fissures warts lesions  
DRE deferred due to tenderness clear external dx discussed with pt  

Investigations – today r/v  
FBE WNL Hb 132 g/L MCV 79 fL low‑normal no anaemia  
U&E LFT WNL  
Fasting glucose 4.9 mmol/L  
Lipids TC 4.8 HDL 1.5 LDL 2.6 TG 0.9 acceptable  
TSH 1.8 mIU/L normal  
Inflam markers not ordered discussed not indicated clinically at present  

Assessment  
1 Thrombosed external haemorrhoid perianal haematoma day 5 severe pain but haemodynamically stable nil red flags for malignancy or abscess  
   Dx supported by typical Hx of acute onset post straining localised tender blue lump and exam findings  
   DDx considered anal fissure perianal abscess prolapsed int haemorrhoid but fissure less likely (pain more focal lump present nil visible fissure) abscess unlikely (afebrile nil systemic upset nil erythema or fluctuance) prolapsed int haemorrhoid unlikely (distinct external haematoma)  

2 Routine health check  
All bloods within acceptable limits nil anaemia thyroid dysfunction DM or sig dyslipidaemia  
Low‑normal MCV likely normal variant vs mild iron issue in future but currently Hb normal asymptomatic  

Plan  

1) Thrombosed ext haemorrhoid  
Explained dx and natural Hx usually very painful first week then pain ↓ markedly over 1–2/52 clot resorbs may leave small skin tag  
Discussed timing re excision usually most benefit if done within ~72h of onset after this pain often already starting to settle and procedure may prolong sx  
Given day 5 and stable exam conservative mgmt appropriate pt agreed  

Analgesia  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1 g QID PRN max 4 g/24h  
- Discussed option short course NSAID eg ibuprofen 400 mg TDS with food for 3–5/7 if needed no renal or GI risk factors identified advised avoid if dehydrated or ↑bleeding pt prefers to hold off for now  

Local care  
- Warm sitz baths 10–15 mins 2–3x/day and after BM  
- Gentle hygiene avoid vigorous wiping suggest soft paper or moist wipes pat dry  

Bowel habit  
- Maintain soft formed stools continue high fibre diet and fluids  
- Psyllium daily titrate to avoid bloating already using  
- If ongoing straining can add stool softener eg docusate 100 mg BD short term pt to contact if req  

Education / safety net  
Reassured this is local venous event not suggestive of systemic clotting disorder given normal FBE and nil FHx  
Explained may rupture spontaneously → brief bleeding with sudden pain relief if occurs keep area clean apply pressure with clean gauze seek r/v if heavy or persistent bleeding ↑pain or ?infection  
Red flags explained worsening pain esp with fever spreading redness swelling difficulty opening bowels or passing urine significant rectal bleeding change in bowel habit wt loss to seek urgent review or ED  

Work  
Advised frequent short walking breaks avoid prolonged sitting consider cushion or ring pillow if helpful for comfort  

2) Test results / prevention  
Went through each result addressed concerns re MCV reassured no current anaemia no action needed now can recheck in 12–24/12 or earlier if sx eg fatigue heavy periods diet change  
Answered Q re inflam markers explained limited role here nil clinical suspicion systemic inflam condition currently so not indicated  

3) Bowel Ca screening / colonoscopy Q  
Pt asked if needs earlier colonoscopy "given this issue"  
Explained isolated thrombosed ext haemorrhoid not indication for colonoscopy in absence of red flag bowel sx or FHx  
Suggested longer appt to go through bowel cancer screening options family Hx and general preventive care in more detail pt agreeable will book when able  

Follow up  
R/V 1/52 to reassess pain and resolution haemorrhoid or earlier if deterioration or red flags  
If limited improvement over next 1–2/52 or recurrent events consider colorectal surgical opinion
