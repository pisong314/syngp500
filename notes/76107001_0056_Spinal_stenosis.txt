22/11/25 AH telehealth – remote clinic

72F new pt – “leg pain need scan + strong painkillers”

HPC  
6–8/12 hx bilat leg pain thighs→calves, ↑ last 4–6/52  
Aching/heavy ± burning “legs going to give way”  
Brought on by walking/standing – can do ~50–100 m flat then has to stop  
Relief within 2–3 mins sitting or leaning fwd (over trolley / bench)  
Can use exercise bike “for ages” w much ↓ pain  
No true LBP today (“back fine”)  
Occ tingling feet when pain bad  
No rest pain, no nocturnal pain  
- red flags: -ve saddle, -ve urinary retention/incont, -ve bowel sx, -ve rapidly ↑ weakness, -ve trauma, -ve wt loss, -ve fevers, no known malignancy  
Very focused on MRI + “injection in spine” + strong analgesia tonight

PMHx  
Nil sig volunteered – ?prev comment “narrow canal” on old scan  
No known DM / IHD / stroke / DVT / PAD

Meds  
PRN paracetamol 1 g bd only  
Avoids NSAIDs (GI upset)  
NKDA

O/E (limited – tele/remote context, brief corridor walk at clinic)  
Obs stable: BP 142/78 HR 78 RR 16 afeb SpO₂ 98% RA  
Gait cautious; symptoms reproduced on short walk, improves quickly leaning fwd  
LL neuro: tone N, power 5/5 all groups, reflexes KJ 2+ AJ 1+ symm, sensation LT/PP intact L2–S1, SLR -ve bilat  
Back: no midline tender, extn ↓ due discomfort, flex OK  
Pulses DP/PT palpable bilat, feet warm, CR <2s, no ulcers, no oedema, no calf tender/swelling

Impression  
Neurogenic claudication 2° likely lumbar spinal canal stenosis  
No current red flags / cauda equina  
PAD, DVT, acute radiculopathy, OA less likely given hx + exam

Plan  
– Explained likely LSS / neurogenic claudication pattern, no emergent MRI indicated tonight  
– Firm discussion re expectations: after-hours service cannot arrange urgent MRI / spinal inj; needs usual GP/regional pathway  
– Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/24h) – advised regular for few days  
  • Offer trial ibuprofen 200 mg tds with food x3–5/7 if tolerates – stop if GI sx / black stool etc  
  • Opioids not prescribed – risks > benefit in chronic spinal pain esp 72F – pt unhappy but accepts  
– No steroids / epidural from this service  
– F/up: see usual GP in regional centre 1–2/52 for:  
  → consider MRI L-spine if ongoing fn limitation  
  → consider physio / structured exercise program  
  → consider spinal/neuro surg referral if persistent severe sx or new neuro deficit  
– Letter/summary done for usual GP (pt to take)  

Safety net  
Red flag advice given: ED / RFDS if new bladder/bowel change, saddle numbness, rapidly ↑ bilat leg weakness, sudden severe back pain w systemic sx  
RTC / tele review earlier if worsening pain or function  

Time  
~15 mins, multiple requests for MRI/opioids, other non-urgent issues (water taste, mattress, sleep) deferred to routine GP appt
