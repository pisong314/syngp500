71M new pt – retired truckie  

C/o “sleep’s been rubbish, I’m up half the night, only got 10 mins so need this sorted”.  

Main issue actually R ear pain at night → waking repeatedly. Pain sharp, “like someone jabbing a match in my ear” when lying on R side. Settles if he turns over/rubs it, then recurs when back on it. Ongoing ~3–4/12, getting worse. Estimates 4–5 hrs broken sleep. No prob getting off to sleep. Denies low mood, racing thoughts, early waking independent of ear.  

Has noticed small painful lump on upper R ear ~6/12, worse with pressure on pillow, sometimes crusty. No discharge, no bleeding other than cracking. No hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, fevers. Heavy lifetime sun exposure (years driving with window down, ears burnt a lot). No known past skin ca.  

Obs: BP 136/78, HR 72 reg, afebrile, SpO₂ 98% RA, BMI ~27 (est).  

R ear: ~6–7 mm firm tender dome-shaped nodule on helix/upper antihelix with superficial central erosion + slight scale/crust, mild surrounding erythema, very focal tenderness to light pressure. No fluctuation, no warmth. No obvious rolled edge/pearly lesion but crust partly obscuring. No pre/post-auricular nodes. Canals/TMs normal. Brief look at face/scalp/dorsal hands – no obvious other suspicious lesions but not full skin check.  

Impression:
1) Sleep disturbance – maintenance insomnia 2° painful R ear lesion (nociceptive, not primary insomnia).  
2) R helix nodular lesion – ?chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) most likely, but NMSC (SCC/BCC) needs exclusion given age + sun damage.  

Plan (time limited, pt rushing, wants “just something for sleep”):  
- Explained likely ear lesion causing awakenings → treat pain/pressure first, hold off on sleeping tabs.  
- Pressure off-loading: advised avoid sleeping on R side, suggested donut/ear pillow / cut hole in cheap foam pillow.  
- Topical: betamethasone valerate 0.02% cream, thinly to lesion OD up to 2/52 then stop (for inflammation only, not definitive tx).  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g up to QID PRN nocte pain (max 4 g/24 h). Avoid sedative hypnotics for now (age, falls/confusion risk, clear pain trigger).  

- Discussed need to r/o skin ca despite CNH likely. Offered more detailed dermatoscopic assessment today + organise biopsy referral – pt declined due to time, “can’t do multiple appointments all the time, need to get back”.  
- Plan: book f/up 1–2/52 (pt wants early morning) for:  
  • Recheck R ear lesion with dermatoscope.  
  • If any doubt re malignancy → refer for biopsy/excision (dermatology vs ENT/plastics – local public vs private to discuss).  
  • Consider full skin check if time.  

- Brief sleep advice only (already regular sleep/wake). Suggested less screen time in bed, avoid long naps. Fan at night OK, unlikely cause of lesion.  

No bloods ordered today – issue clearly local ear lesion, first visit and very time limited, will consider routine bloods (FBC, UEC, LFT, lipids, HbA1c) at later review if ongoing issues / for baseline.  

Safety-net: RTC earlier / urgent review if lesion enlarges, ulcerates, bleeds, becomes non-healing or new lesions appear, or if sleep significantly worse.  

Pt verbalised understanding but reiterated time constraints. F/up appt booked 1–2/52. 09:12
