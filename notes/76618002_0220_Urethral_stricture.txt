47yo man (electrician)  

C/O  
Urine “leaking into my jocks” last few weeks, long hx weak stream. Known urethral stricture.  

History (bit all over the place today)  
- Stricture dx ~2 yrs ago by urology after cystoscopy, had dilatation 2023 → good for about a year then “slowly getting crook again”.  
- Last 3–4 mths: worsening hesitancy, straining, weak stream, long time to empty, feels not empty after going. Frequency q1–2h, nocturia 2–3.  
- Last ~3 wks: small-volume dribbling esp. post‑void and sometimes no urge. “I’m finding my jocks are damp even though I’ve just been.” Using tissue in underwear.  
- Lower abdo “pressure/fullness”, mild, worse when holding on.  
- Denies dysuria, visible blood, fevers, rigors, flank pain, N/V, severe suprapubic pain. Never had acute retention needing catheter.  
- No known neuro issues, no red flag neuro sx volunteered.  
- No regular meds, no recent anticholinergics/opioids/cold & flu.  
- Very worried about kidneys: “Is this going to stuff my kidneys long term?”  

SH: lives with partner + kids, works on sites, often holds on at work. Nonsmoker, a few beers/wk.  

Exam (focused)  
Gen: looks well, not distressed.  
Obs: BP 128/78, HR 78 reg, RR 14, T 36.6, SpO₂ 99% RA.  
Abdo: palpable, non‑tender distended bladder to ~3–4cm below umbilicus, dull to percussion. No flank tenderness.  
GU: ext genitals NAD, no meatal stenosis obvious.  
DRE: normal tone. Prostate mildly enlarged, smooth, non‑tender, no nodules.  

Bedside  
- Bladder scan post‑void: PVR ~650 mL.  
- Dipstick: SG 1.015, pH 6, no LE, nitrites, blood, protein, glucose, ketones.  

Impression  
Chronic urinary retention with overflow incontinence in 47yo man with known urethral stricture. Large PVR + palpable bladder. Likely recurrent/progressive urethral stricture main issue; BPH may be contributing but less likely primary given age and prior stricture dx. No evidence UTI or acute retention today. Needs decompression + urgent urology. Risk renal impairment if ongoing.  

Plan (a bit rushed, 15‑min appt)  

1) Immediate  
- Discussed chronic retention, overflow mechanism, risks (UTI, renal damage, long‑term bladder dysfunction).  
- Offered CISC vs IDC. Pt prefers IDC initially: “I’d rather just have the bag for now till I get my head around it, don’t want to be doing that on site yet.”  
- Nurse to insert urethral IDC this afternoon: 16Fr Foley, leg bag/day + night bag, securement.  
- Ask nurse to record drained volume; if >>1L, advise monitor for post‑obstructive diuresis, push oral fluids, RTC/ED if dizzy, very dry, etc.  
- Basic catheter care explained, written info given. Red flags: blocked catheter/no urine 2–3h despite fluids, severe suprapubic pain, fevers, flank pain, clots.  

2) Ix  
Ordered today:  
- UEC/eGFR, FBC, CRP (baseline, check renal given chronic retention).  
- Urine MCS (preferably pre‑catheter; if not, fresh sample from new IDC).  
- Renal tract USS incl. bladder (pre/post catheter as radiology can manage) – look for hydronephrosis, bladder wall changes, stones, residual when trial off IDC later.  

(No prior UECs on file to compare – new baseline.)  

3) Referral  
- Urgent/semi‑urgent urology referral: recurrent urethral stricture, chronic retention with overflow, PVR 650 mL, IDC in situ. Request:  
  - Review stricture, ?repeat urethroscopy/dilatation vs urethroplasty.  
  - Consider urodynamics.  
  - Advice on longer‑term bladder emptying (CISC training vs definitive repair vs ongoing catheter).  
- Pt agrees to prioritise attendance even if needs time off work.  

4) Meds  
- No abx today – no clinical/UA evidence infection. Will review once MCS back.  
- Simple analgesia PRN (paracetamol ± ibuprofen) for discomfort/catheter irritation.  
- Not starting alpha‑blocker now – obstruction likely structural urethral rather than primary BPH; leave to urology.  

5) Bowel/fluids/other  
- Briefly discussed constipation possibly worsening urinary sx; advised aim for softer regular stool (dietary fibre, fluids).  
- Reassured energy drinks not causing stricture but caffeine may increase frequency → suggested cutting back.  
- Advised avoid deliberately holding on at work, esp. while catheter in and after.  

Safety net  
- Explained kidney risk if untreated; current plan aimed at preventing this (IDC + bloods + USS + urology).  
- ED/urgent review if: can’t pass urine and severe pain, catheter blocked, fevers/rigors/flank pain, gross haematuria with clots.  

Follow‑up  
- Nurse appt today for IDC insertion + education.  
- GP review 3–4 days: check bloods + urine, review symptoms post‑decompression, check for post‑obstructive diuresis, ensure catheter OK.  
- Further GP review ~2 wks and after urology opinion.  
- Preventive health (lipids, bowel screen etc.) to be done later once urinary issue settled.  

09:34 – note finished, bloods/USS forms printed, urology referral sent (eRef).
