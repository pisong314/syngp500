C/O needs Centrelink / housing form done re current leg prob and work capacity  
Says wants "proof Im not fit for all this running around"  

HPC  
R shin wound after knock on metal platform @work ~10/7 ago  
Initially small lac cleaned with tap water + "abit of metho"  
Last 3–4/7 ↑redness tenderness yellow ooze  
Feels "off" more tired walking with mild limp due pain

On MTX + low dose pred for inflammatory arthritis (rheum) reluctant to go into details today "thats not why Im here"  
Known haemochromatosis venesections ongoing last spec r/v ~6/12 ago per record  

Function  
Past few days ↑pain and swelling R leg ↓tol for prolonged walking standing heavy work  
Wants form to say "not fit for all this job search rubbish until this is sorted"

Ix today  
- Wound swab M/C/S from purulent material after saline clean  
- Discussed baseline bloods FBE CRP U&E LFTs ferritin/iron studies BGL given immunosuppression + iron overload pt declined "Im not wasting time with needles" refusal documented  

A  
1 Infected traumatic wound R ant shin mild–mod cellulitis in high risk host  
   - Localised signs only presently afebrile but immunosuppressed + haemochromatosis → ↑risk fulminant infection  
2 Immunosuppression 2° MTX + pred for inflammatory arthritis  
3 Haemochromatosis iron overload  
4 Psychosocial stressors housing + job insecurity requesting Centrelink/housing paperwork short term work capacity impacted

# Wound infection / cellulitis  
- Classed as complicated infection due immunosuppression + iron overload low threshold escalation  
- Start oral abx  
  • Cephalexin 500mg PO QID 7/7  
  • Discussed MRSA coverage option TMP/SMX 160/800mg BD 5/7 if no improvement @48h or cephalexin not tolerated  
    pt reluctant "too many tablets" plan start cephalexin alone review clinical course + swab result  
- Wound care in rooms  
  • Irrigated with 0.9% NaCl non adherent dressing applied  
  • Adv daily saline clean dressing change keep clean dry avoid hosing @work avoid baths pools  

- Immunosuppression  
  • Adv hold MTX this week due acute infection  
  • Continue pred at current dose avoid self ↑ without GP/rheum advice  
  Pt initially resistant "rheumy said not to fiddle with it" accepted after explanation standard practice re infection  

- Safety net  
  Explained in plain language higher risk of sepsis due MTX pred + iron overload  
  ED/000 if fever ≥38 shaking chills rapidly spreading redness severe pain out of keeping with appearance vomiting dizziness confusion or feels systemically very crook  
  RTC / ED if nil improvement in 24–48h on abx or earlier if worsening  

# Ix / referrals  
- Await wound M/C/S adjust abx as indicated  
- Recomend bloods as above at f/u if pt agreeable  
- Consider update letter to rheum if prolonged course recurrent infection or need to hold MTX longer  

# Centrelink / housing form  
- Completed form today as per clinical findings  
  Documented temporary ↓capacity for prolonged standing walking heavy outdoor or physically demanding work until infection resolved  
  Noted need for ready access to medical r/v if deterioration  
- Clarified short term functional limitation vs permanent incapacity pt unhappy wanted stronger wording but explained must be accurate  

# Comorbidities  
- Haemochromatosis  
  Noted as sig infection risk factor encouraged ongoing spec f/u venesection schedule  
  Plan longer chronic disease r/v in next few wks for bloods etc once acute issue settled  
- Immunosuppression  
  Brief counselling re ↑infection risk and need for early presentation pt partly receptive  

F/U  
- R/V 48h for wound check obs consider bloods review need to broaden abx longer appt booked  
- Earlier R/V or ED if red flags as above  

Time  
Extended consult ~20min due de escalation detailed infection counselling wound care abx discussion + Centrelink/housing paperwork  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Smith – wound swab not yet resulted lab message pending will review at 48h r/v and adjust abx if needed]
