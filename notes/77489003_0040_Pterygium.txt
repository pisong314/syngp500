Eyes  
- VA approx 6/9 R 6/9 L on Snellen in room (pt distractable repeated) able read number plate across car park  
- L eye nasal conjunctival fibrovascular growth triangular extending ~2.5–3mm onto cornea from limbus not near visual axis mild conjunctival injection around lesion nil ulceration nil obvious dellen nil purulent discharge  
- R eye small nasal pinguecula very early pterygium like change no corneal involvement  
- Pupils equal round RRL no RAPD  
- EOMI full nil diplopia lids WNL  
- Fluorescein basic check no abrasion or ulcer tear film a bit irregular over pterygium only  
- Nil ciliary flush nil photophobia on exam

A  
1 Pterygium L eye mod symptomatic irritation + intermittent end of day blur assoc dry eye type sx occupational UV wind dust exposure 2°  
2 Early nasal conjunctival change R eye pinguecula/very early pterygium asymptomatic  
3 Ongoing high occupational UV exposure risk factor  

P  
1 Pterygium L eye / ocular surface irritation  
- Education re benign lesion but potential progression → visual axis if enlarges reassured nil signs infection or acute sight threatening issue today  
- Lubrication start preservative free artificial tears eg sodium hyaluronate or CMC 1–2 gtt OU QID + PRN esp hot windy days consider lubricating ointment HS if persisting dryness later  
- Cold compress PRN after work if very irritated  

2 UV / environmental protection  
- Strongly advised wraparound sunglasses with good UV protection esp @work  
- Broad brim hat outdoors  
- Avoid direct wind where possible use eye PPE on dusty days info sheet on pterygium UV protection given  

3 Referral  
- Non urgent ophthalmology ref for baseline assessment pterygium size refraction slit lamp consider timing of excision vs ongoing conservative mx occupational UV exposure noted  
- Copy ref printed for pt and sent electronically  

4 Ix  
- Nil GP Ix today no red flags (nil acute vision loss severe pain photophobia ulceration) defer detailed refraction etc to ophthal  

5 Occupational counselling  
- Discussed long term eye health importance PPE esp as supervisor encourge leading by example pt digressed re old foreman not liking safety glasses redirected  

6 Deferred issues  
- Knee niggle and broader preventive health (lipids bowel ca screening etc) deferred due time asked to book long appt 20–30min in next 4–6/52 for gen check + MSK  

7 F/U & safety net  
- GP r/v 3/12 or earlier if  
  - rapid ↑ in size of lesion  
  - new or persistent visual change incl driving reading night glare  
  - sig pain photophobia discharge sudden redness  
- ED or urgent eye clinic if sudden vision loss severe eye pain marked photophobia or trauma  

Meds today  
- Recommended OTC preservative free artificial tears QID/PRN no script required brands discussed  

Pt understanding  
- Pt able to summarise lesion benign related to sun wind needs drops better eye protection will see eye specialist "before it gets to the middle of the eye" still somewhat tangental but core points understood
