CC:  
F/up fatgiue, “eye growth” / UV exposr  

HPI:  
54yo male, construciton worker, known pterygium L>R.  
2–3 mths tired, “hit a wall about 3–4pm”. Sleeping ~7h, partner not noticed snoring/apnoeas. No wt loss, fevers, night sweats, CP, SOB, neuro sx. Mood “pretty good, just a bit flat cos I’m tired”, denies dep/anx. EtOH 2–3 beers wkend.  

Pt query thyroid – read about “subclinical” thryoid onlne. Also query if UV at work / pterygium making him tired, eyes sometimes “gritty”.  

Pterygium hx: dx ~3 yrs, L nasal > R, irriation + cosmetic bother, no acute pain/photophobia. Feels L vis maybe a bit blurrier. Using Systane PRN. No prev ophthal rev. Often forgets wrap-around sunnies on site.  

PMHx: pterygium OU. No other known chrnoic dz.  
Meds: Systane PRN. NKDA.  
SHx: works full-time outdoors, high UV. Non-smoker.  

Exam:  
Gen: well, NAD.  
Obs: BP 126/78, HR 74 reg, RR 14, T 36.7, SpO2 99% RA, BMI ~27.  
CVS/Resp/Abdo: unremarkable.  
Neuro: grossly non-focal, power 5/5, gait normal.  
Eyes: fleshy triangluar lesion nasal L cornea ~2–3mm past limbus, smaller nasal pterygium R just crossing limbus, non-inflamed. Cornea otherwise clear to gross exam. VA (uncorr Snellen, rough): R 6/9, L 6/12. Pupils equal/reactive. Mild gritty sens L>R.  

Impresson:  
1) Fatigue, subacute, non-specific, 54yo M  
   – No red flag sx on hx/exam. Likely multifactorial (phys work, diet, age), but need to r/o common organic causes (anaemia, thyroid, DM, renal/liver, B12/folate, iron def, inflamm).  
   – Picture not suggestive of MG or thyroid eye dz.  

2) Pterygium OU (L>R), symptomatic  
   – Likely UV-related. Mild ↓VA L, needs formal refraction/slit lamp.  
   – Reassured not causing systemic fatgiue.  

Plan:  

1) Fatigue  
   – D/w pt broad ddx, thyroid only one possiblity.  
   – Path ordered today (bulk billed):  
     • FBC  
     • U&E, CMP incl LFTs  
     • Fasting BSL, HbA1c  
     • Lipids (opportunisitc screen)  
     • TSH, fT4  
     • Iron studies (ferritin, iron, transferrin, Tsat)  
     • B12, folate  
     • CRP, ESR  
   – RTC 1–2 wks for results / review.  
   – Red flags explained – seek urgent care if CP, SOB, palps, wt loss, night sweats, neuro sx, rapidly worse fatgiue.  

2) Pterygium  
   – Adv UV protection (wrap-around sunnies, broad brim hat at work), more regular artificail tears (PF if poss).  
   – Non-urgent ophthal ref sent today to discss surgical vs conservative, esp L eye, assess astigmatism.  
   – Gave RANZCO/Healthdirect info link in pt handout.  

3) Preventive care  
   – Pt asked about “screening for everything at my age”. Time limited today.  
   – Advised separate long appt for preventive health check (CVD risk, bowel ca screen, skin check, vax etc). Pt agreeable.  

Billing:  
Standard consult, bulk billed.
