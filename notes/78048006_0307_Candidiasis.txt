Telephone consult  

Pt: 42 yr woman regular pt of practice lives in rural town works as community support worker

Reason for consult  
Pt requested phone appt re recurrent oral thrush  
"cream for thrush on my tongue again"  
Also wanting to "check its not something worse with my HIV"  

Hx of presenting problem  
5–6/7 Hx oral sx  
White patches on tongue and hard palate "like cottage cheese" that she can scrape off  
Mild burning esp with hot or spicy foods otherwise "mostly just annoying not really painful"  
Altered taste "food tastes abit funny like cottony"  
Nil dysphagia nil odynophagia nil retrosternal pain  
Nil fevers rigors or feeling systemically crook  
Nil SOB cough new wt loss appetite ok  

Context  
Completed abx course ~2/52 ago for leg skin infection likely fluclox per old notes  
Onset of sx shortly after stopping abx  
Has ↑ intake of sugar‑free soft drink lately asking "could that be making it worse" explained may alter oral environment but main drivers likely abx + BSLs  

Prev episodes  
Recurrent oral thrush in past in setting of HIV + variable DM control  
Last episode ~8/12 ago good response to topical miconazole oral gel x10/7  
Nil Hx oesophageal candidiasis documented  

PMHx (brief r/v)  
HIV on ART tenofovir/emtricitabine + dolutegravir usually adherent  
Last HIV VL undetectable 4/12 ago CD4 420  
T2DM on metformin 1 g BD + gliclazide MR 60 mg mane last HbA1c 8.2% (3/12 ago) pt says "my sugars been abit up and down esp with night shifts"  
Obesity BMI ~34 at last face to face r/v  
Nil inhaled steroids nil dentures non smoker  

Meds (per record confirmed)  
- Tenofovir/emtricitabine 1 tab mane  
- Dolutegravir 50 mg mane  
- Metformin 1 g BD  
- Gliclazide MR 60 mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nocte  
Nil anticoag incl nil warfarin  
NKDA  

Red flag screen (tel)  
Nil difficulty swallowing solids or liquids  
Nil retrosternal pain  
Nil fixed white patches or lumps per pt description lesions wipe off  
Nil oral ulceration or bleeding  
Nil recent hospital stay neutropenia indwelling lines  

ICE  
Ideas thinks due to "those antibiotics" and "my sugars not being great"  
Concerns worried "is this a sign my HIV is getting worse again" reassured current picture + recent VL/CD4 suggest stable HIV oral thrush common with abx + DM  
Expectations wants effective tx and advice to avoid recurrence  

Exam (tel only)  
Not examined in person  
On phone speaking full sentences voice clear nil audible SOB nil distress  
Hx and prior pattern suggest pseudomembranous oral candidiasis mild–mod  
Nil features from Hx to suggest oesophageal involvement or systemic sepsis  

Assessment  
1 Oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis pseudomembranous type in adult with risk factors recent abx T2DM suboptimal control HIV (currently well controlled) obesity  
   Likely uncomplicated oral thrush confined to oropharynx  
2 HIV infection stable on ART last VL undetectable CD4 420 not primary issue today  
3 T2DM suboptimal glycaemic control contributing to recurrent infections brief discussion only this consult  
4 Obesity background RF  

Differential dx  
- Oral candidiasis most likely given classic description removable white plaques temporal link to abx DM HIV  
- Less likely leukoplakia or oral lichen planus as lesions wipe off and acute onset  
- Viral stomatitis unlikely nil ulcers nil systemic sx  
- Oesophageal candidiasis unlikely currently as nil dysphagia odynophagia retrosternal pain  

Ix  
Given recurrent thrush + immunocompromise (HIV + DM) plan further r/v  
- Arrange in person GP appt within 1/52 for full oral exam  
- At that visit consider oral swab for MCS if lesions atypical or poor response to current tx or ?resistance  
Path ordered today via EMR to local pathology (S&N)  
- HbA1c  
- Fasting lipids UEC LFT  
- Fasting BSL  
- HIV VL + CD4 count (due for routine monitoring so aligning)  
Results pending  

Management  

1 Oral candidiasis  
- Start miconazole 2% oral gel 2.5 mL QID after food for 10–14/7 continue ≥2/7 after sx resolution  
  Apply with clean finger spread over tongue cheeks palate hold in mouth then swallow  
  Avoid food drink x30 mins post dose  
- Explained expected improvement over few days advised complete course even if beter  
- AEs discussed nausea local irritation possible advised to seek care if rash breathing difficulty or sx worsen or nil improvement by ~5–7/7  
- If inadequate response or intolerance at f/u will consider oral fluconazole eg 200 mg daily x7/7 per eTG check for DDI with ART (none signif with current regimen but will reconfirm)  

2 Risk factor modification / self care  
- Oral hygiene emphasised brush teeth BID soft brush gentle tongue clean rinse mouth with water after meals and after soft drinks  
- Advised ↓ frequency of soft drink including sugar‑free as acidic and may predispose to oral issues encourage water as main drink  
- Already non smoker nil dentures  

3 Diabetes  
- Reiterated link between ↑ BGLs and recurrent thrush and skin infections  
- Asked pt to book chronic disease r/v with PN + GP in next 2–3/52 to address  
  • Meds optimisation  
  • Diet physical activity wt  
  • Foot check vaccs etc  
Pt says "I can come in next week after my morning shift"  
(Prev plan DM r/v 03/05/23 15/08/24 not done so will combine)  

4 HIV  
- Reassured that this episode does not necessarily indicate HIV progression given recent undetectable VL and reasonable CD4  
- Encouraged strict adherence to ART pt says "I havent missed any tabs"  
- Will r/v new VL/CD4 when available and continue usual specialist f/u schedule  

5 Safety net  
- Advised to seek urgent review GP or ED if  
  • New difficulty or pain swallowing food sticking or chest pain on swallowing (?oesophageal candida)  
  • Fevers rigors feeling very crook or markedly fatigued  
  • New oral lesions that do not wipe off persistent ulcers lumps or bleeding  
Pt verbalised understanding repeated key points coherantly  

6 Other issues  
Pt briefly mentioned wt concerns and "knees playing up abit" deferred detailed discussion to upcoming chronic disease r/v due to time today  

Plan / F/U  
- Script for miconazole oral gel sent to local pharmacy eRx  
- In person GP appt within 1/52 for oral exam assess response to tx collect any outstanding pathology forms if needed  
- Chronic disease r/v (DM wt HIV monitoring knee pain) with GP + PN in ~2–3/52 consider care plan / review item  
- If thrush not significantly improved by day 7 or recurs soon  
  → consider oral fluconazole course  
  → oral swab MCS  
  → discuss with HIV specialist if atypical or resistant picture  

Pt engagement  
Cooperative engaged asked appropriate Qs about meds and prevention good recall of ART + DM meds confirms adherence appears reliable historian
