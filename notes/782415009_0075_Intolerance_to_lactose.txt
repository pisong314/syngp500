34F – f/up raised BP / h/o lactose intol + SIBO  

CC  
Review high BP readings, query link with gut issues.  

HPI  
BP noted up at pharamcy and last vist. Home/pharmacy over ~2 wks mostly 135–145/85–92, few to 150/95. No prev dx HTN, no meds. Denies CP, SOB, neuro sx, visual chagnes, no H/A. Some work stress, reduced slepe.  
Pt wondering if “SIBO / low grade inflamation + lactose free diet / Ca tabs” causing BP. Also ↑ long blacks, more salty snacks.  

GI: known lactose intol (sx bloating + loose stool if higher lactose, esp icecream/soft cheese). No wt loss, PR bleed, nocturnal D, vom.  
SIBO dx by gastro ~18/12 ago via breath test, had rifaximin course – good short term. Now mild recurrance of bloating only, manageable. Happy to park detailed gut discusion.  

PMHx  
- Lactose intolerance  
- SIBO – mild recurr sx  
No known HTN, DM, CKD, CVD.  

Meds  
- OTC probiotic  
- Ca + Vit D  
- occas lactase tabs  
NKDA.  

Exam  
Well apprearing.  
BP 148/92 → 145/90 (R arm, seated, after rest).  
HR 76 reg, RR 14, SpO2 99% RA, afeb.  
CVS dual HS, no murmur, no oedema. Chest clear. Abd soft, non-tender, mild bloating only.  

Impression  
1) Elevated BP – ?early primary HTN vs white coat. Multiple raised readings incl today + pharmacy, FHx. No end organ sx. SIBO/lactose intol unlikely primary cause; more likely salt, stress, poor slepe.  
2) Lactose intolerance – partial control, still sx with higher lactose. Needs more structured diet plan but avoid over-restriction, ensure Ca.  
3) SIBO – mild relapse, stable, no red flags. Can review in longer appt / with dietitan, poss gastro if worsens.  

Plan  
1. BP / CV risk  
- Explained need for strucutred home BP before labelling HTN.  
- Home BP monitoring plan: buy validated upper arm cuff; check x2 readings am + pm for 7 days, discard day1, bring av day2–7. Avoid caffeine/exercise 30 mins prior, sit quietly first.  
- Path ordered today via SNP: FBC, UEC, LFT, fasting lipids, HbA1c, TSH, urine ACR.  
- Lifestyle focus: reduce salty snacks/processed foods, ↑ activity (aim brisk walks), improve sleep hygiene, keep ETOH moderate.  
- Reassured lactose free milk/plant milks + std Ca supplements not known to ↑BP at normal doses.  
- If 7‑day home av ≥135/85 will consider dx HTN and discuess starting low dose ACEi vs trial longer lifestyle depending on absolute CV risk.  

2. Lactose intolerance  
- Brief rev of low‑lactose approach (avoid large ammounts of high lactose foods; small ammounts / hard cheese usually ok; use lactase tabs when planning to “push it”).  
- Keep Ca intake via lactose free/fortified products + current supplement.  
- Refer to APD dietitian (local) – letter sent via HealthLink re lactose intol + SIBO, request indiv plan to balance sx control and nutrtion.  

3. SIBO  
- Mild sx only, no red flags, no repeat abx now.  
- Plan longer review 4–6/52 to go through GI pattern, dietitan input, consider repeat breath test / gastro re-referral if deteriation.  

F/up  
- Review 2–3/52 with home BP log + path results → decide on HTN dx/tx.  
- Longer 20–30 min appt ~4–6/52 for SIBO/gut focus.  
- RTC sooner / ED if CP, SOB, neuro sx, severe H/A or BP >180/110 at home; or new GI red flags (wt loss, PR bleed, persistant vom, nocturnal D, fevers).
