32 yr old F primary school teacher – f/u GI sx  

# Hx  
C/O intermittent vomiting recent GI upset known lactose intolerance  

Pt quite tangential needs frequent redirection long stories re school daughter in Perth neighbour with “stomach issues” etc  
When asked about vomiting starts “It was the week after parent teacher interviews which are always stressful and the new principal…” then drifts off  

HPC – vomiting / lactose intolerance  
Known lactose intolerance coeliac disease Crohn (ileal)  
Seen ~3/52 ago with nausea bloating 2x vomiting after wkend of ice cream milkshakes advised low lactose diet lactose free alternatives  

Today  
- Vomiting now very infrequent  
  - 1 episode 5/7 ago after “large hot chocolate and a bit of cheesecake” at staff function  
  - Prior to last visit had ~3–4 episodes/wk  
- Nausea mild intermittent usually 1–2h after larger dairy intake  
- Bloating abdo discomfort much improved avoiding milk still gets bloating if “I forget and have real milk in my tea”  
- Bowels 1–2/day formed nil diarrhoea nil blood or mucus  
- Nil fevers clothes fit same pt not weighing herself  
- Nil dysphagia nil severe abdo pain nil nocturnal pain nil haematemesis  

Pt theories  
- Thinks sx due to “the water at school it tastes funny maybe something in the pipes” also “being run off my feet I barely sit down so maybe everything just comes back up”  
- Reassured likely 2° lactose exposure clear temporal link nil red flags  

Coeliac disease  
Dx several yrs ago on biopsy  
Says “pretty strict” gluten free diet occasional slip ups at parties  
No recent known gluten exposure nil current diarrhoea or overt malabsorption sx  

Crohn disease  
Ileal Crohn followed by gastro in regional centre pt unclear which town goes into long story re the drive bakeries etc  
Last spec r/v ~6/12 ago told in remission  
On mesalazine oral exact dose unclear “big white tablets I take two in the morning and one at night”  
Nil PR bleeding nil signif abdo pain nil perianal sx  

Diet / lifestyle  
Since last visit switched to lactose free milk at home uses soy milk when remembers to ask @ cafés still occasionally forgets has full dairy when busy  
Tolerates small amts cheese butter  
Calcium intake ↓ avoids most dairy not on supplements  
Non smoker EtOH minimal “glass of wine on the weekend if I’m not marking books”  
Lives with husband stable housing drives self  

Meds  
- Mesalazine (dose reg to confirm with dispensing Hx)  
- Occ paracetamol  
Nil regular anti emetics  
NKDA  

Psychosocial  
High work stress around reports and behaviour issues in class spends time describing particular students parents  
Time limited today advised book longer appt if wants to go into stress sleep mood  

# Ex  
General well appearing alert talkative nil acute distress  
Vitals BP 118/72 HR 76 reg RR 14 Temp 36.7°C SpO₂ 99% RA  
Wt 68kg similar to 3/12 ago  
Abdo soft non distended mild subjectve central bloating nil tenderness guarding or rebound no masses BS normal  
Nil peripheral oedema nil oral ulcers  

# Impression / Dx  
1 Lactose intolerance – f/u  
Symptoms (bloating mild nausea occasional vomiting) closely correlated with signif lactose load improved since dietary change  
Still intermittently exceeding personal lactose threshold eg hot choc + cheesecake  
Nil alarm features wt stable nil GI bleeding nil persistent vomiting  

2 Coeliac disease – established  
Clinically stable on current GFD with only occasional lapses nil current sx to suggest active disease but needs nutritional monitoring  

3 Crohn disease – ileal in reported remission  
No features of flare currently stools formed nil PR blood nil signif pain  
Continue current regimen under gastro  

4 Work related stress  
Raised tangentially conc@work ok but feels “pretty strung out”  
Not fully explored today due to time  

DDx for vomiting currently  
- Lactose related functional disturbance most likely  
- Less likely but considered Crohn flare coeliac relapse peptic disease infection IBS SIBO medication effect  
Absence of red flags exam benign stable wt makes serious pathology less likely at present  

# Plan  
Lactose intolerance  
- Reinforced education sx likely 2° lactose load rather than school water or activity level  
- Advised continue lactose free milk at home  
- When out request lactose free or soy milk (prefer Ca fortified) consistently  
- Limit high lactose foods larger serves fresh milk milkshakes hot chocolates ice cream custard condensed/evap milk  
- Reassured does not need complete dairy exclusion can continue hard cheeses butter small amts milk powder in foods as tolerated  
- Discussed trial of lactase enzyme tabs prior to occasional “treats” eg staff morning tea hot choc ice cream  

Nutrition / bone health  
- Discussed importance of adequate Ca esp with restricted dairy + IBD + coeliac  
- Encouraged Ca fortified lactose free or soy products  
- Offered dietitian referral to APD familiar with coeliac Crohn lactose intolerance pt agreeable  
- Referral sent to local dietitian today  

Crohn / coeliac  
- Continue mesalazine as per gastro  
- Advised to seek earlier r/v if ↑ diarrhoea PR blood wt loss fevers signif abdo pain or persistent vomiting  
- Continue GFD dietitian to also review coeliac management  

Investigations ordered today  
Given multiple GI conditions need for monitoring opportunistic with on site pathology  
- FBC U&E LFT  
- CRP  
- Vit D B12 folate  
- Coeliac serology (TTG IgA) baseline adherence check noting known dx  

Stress / mental health  
- Acknowledged work stress suggested separate longer appt 20–30 min after reports finished to go through coping strategies sleep mood ?need MHCP  
- Pt agreeable will book  

Safety net  
- Red flags discussed seek urgent review ED if  
  - Persistent vomiting unable to keep fluids down  
  - Vomiting blood or black stools  
  - Severe worsening abdo pain fever or signs dehydration  
- If ongoing frequent sx despite low lactose diet + lactase trial will consider further workup ?IBS ?SIBO ?Crohn flare liaise with gastro  

F/U  
- R/V 4–6/52 to  
  - Check bloods  
  - Assess response to stricter lactose reduction and lactase  
  - Reassess Crohn coeliac status  
  - Address stress / MH as needed  
- Earlier PRN if sx worsen or new concerns  

[Added 16:30 by Dr L Chan – pathology not yet resulted pt attended collection today will r/v results next appt]
