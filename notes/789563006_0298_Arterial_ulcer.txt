Impression / DDx  
Extensive discussion held re likely dx and alternative causes  
Main working dx  
1 Chronic arterial ulcer R lateral forefoot 2° severe PAD + T2DM features arterial ulcer >10 wks punched out minimal exudate very painful esp on elevation absent distal pulses ABPI ~0.5  
2 Severe PAD w lifestyle limiting claudication and probable chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) given ulcer >2/52 rest/ulcer pain ABPI ~0.5  
3 T2DM suboptimally monitored probable peripheral neuropathy  
4 Established CAD hyperlip HTN stable but overall very ↑ CV risk given PAD  
5 HTN borderline today in CLTI context avoid aggressive BP ↓ for now  

DDx for non healing ulcer explained to pt inc  
– Arterial insufficiency (most likely)  
– Neuropathic diabetic ulcer  
– Venous ulcer (less likely given exam)  
– Malignancy eg Marjolin SCC in chronic ulcer discussed as rare but serious if fails to improve  
– Infection incl osteomyelitis discussed nil current clinical evidence but risk ↑ if deterioration  

Plan  
Given ABPI ~0.5 and diabetes limb considered at risk extensive discussion re urgency and potential for tissue loss incl risk of amputation if deterioration or delayed revasc pt verbalised understanding repeatedly  

1 Vascular surg input – urgent  
• 14 25 – phone call to on call vascular reg at [nearest tertiary hosp] discussed hx exam ABPI photos of ulcer (pt consented verbal)  
• Plan from vascular team urgent OPD r/v within 1 wk they will contact pt directly if appt delayed advised pt to present ED earlier if any deterioration  
• Detailed referral letter sent today via Healthlink summarising hx meds exam ABPI and highlighting CLTI concern copy printed for pt  

2 Wound care interim  
• Ulcer cleaned today warm saline loose slough gently wiped nil sharp debridement due poor perfusion explained risk of tissue damage if aggressive debridement prior to revasc pt agreed  
• Non adherent dressing eg Mepitel + dry gauze + light fixation applied nil compression given arterial ulcer ABPI 0.5  
• Advised daily check of wound for ↑ pain redness pus odour spreading warmth  
• Keep foot clean dry avoid soaking in hot water avoid direct heater on skin esp given neuropathy risk of burn  
• Footwear discussed in detail avoid old tight work boots wide soft shoe or open heel slipper at home nil bare feet  

3 Infection  
Currently nil clinical evidence infection nil erythema warmth pus systemic sx  
• No abx started discussed pros/cons of empirical abx and risk of resistance masking deterioration pt agreed to watchful waiting  
• Clear safety netting if redness spreads ↑ discharge malodour fever or feels unwell → ED or urgent same day r/v  

4 CV risk / meds  
Meds to continue unchanged for now  
• Aspirin 100 mane  
• Atorvastatin 40 nocte  
• Perindopril 5 mane  
• Bisoprolol 2.5 mane  
• Metformin XR 1g mane  
• Gliclazide MR 60 mane  
Discussed rationale for ongoing antiplatelet and high intensity statin in setting of CAD + PAD addressed pt concern re possible statin SE including myalgia liver issues explained benefits > risks and that we would check LFTs CK if sx arise pt verbalised understanding  
BP 148/74 today discussed balance between limb perfusion vs long term stroke/MI risk agreed not to ↑ antihypertensives until vascular plan clarified then reassess  
Encouraged gentle walking within claudication limits short frequent walks rest when pain starts avoid long walks that worsen ulcer pressure  

5 Diabetes  
Explained that glycaemic control impacts wound healing + long term vascular risk  
Pt unsure last HbA1c prev GP retired possibly ~9–12 mths ago  
Ordered today via Sullivan Nicolaides  
• HbA1c  
• Fasting lipids  
• UEC eGFR  
• LFTs  
• FBC  
• Urine ACR  
Results to be r/v next appt consider add SGLT2i or GLP1 RA depending renal fn cost PBS eligibility discussed briefly pt interested but wants more info later  
Basic diet advice only today given time pressure plan longer DM care review once vascular situation clearer  

6 Pain control  
Currently using occasional paracetamol only  
Suggested regular paracetamol 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h discussed liver safety  
Discussed option short course opioid at night if pain remains severe and sleep poor pt prefers to “see how I go” for now  
Advised slight leg dependency at night elevate head of bed to help rest pain  

7 Education / consent / written info  
Extensive discussion re PAD pathophys pulses ulcer non healing need for possible angiogram stent or bypass as per vascular team emphasised that without improving blood flow ulcer unlikely to heal fully  
Discussed risks of progression to gangrene sepsis possible need for amputation if rapid deterioration pt appeared understandably worried but coherant asked appropriate questions  
Provided written info Healthdirect printouts re peripheral arterial disease and diabetic foot care documented given  
Discussed heater use around legs explained risk of burns esp w neuropathy clarified heater itself unlikely to “dry out” ulcer but direct heat harmful  
Also discussed footwear and daily foot checks colour temp breaks in skin nails advised to continue podiatry for nail care rather than self cutting  

8 Other issues  
Pt briefly asked re general check up and skin check explained priority today is limb ischaemia advised booking longer appt once vascular plan underway for chronic dz review skin check etc pt agreeable  

Safety netting  
Very explicit safety net given seriousness  
Advised immediate ED if  
• Sudden ↑ foot pain at rest not settling w paracetamol  
• New blackening or colour change of toes or rapid ↑ size depth of ulcer  
• Spreading redness warmth or purulent discharge up foot or leg  
• Fever chills feeling acutely unwell  
Also advised r/v GP urgently if vascular appt not received within 5–7 days or if any concerns at all pt repeated back key red flags in own words indicating understanding  

Follow up  
R/v here 5–7 days or earlier PRN to  
• Check ulcer pulses pain  
• Assess for infection  
• R/v pathology results adjust DM and CV meds as needed  
• Confirm vascular appt  
Pt agreed to plan states he understands seriousness and will attend ED promptly if deterioration
