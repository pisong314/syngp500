Reason: L shoulder “swollen” and sore again  

52F, known to us, works in community aged care. Mostly here today re L shoulder, says “same shoulder thing as before but puffier now”. Chronic stuff otherwise “all stable” – not covered today.

HPI (bit jumbled, came out over consult):  
- ~3–4 wks gradually ↑ L shoulder pain, worse with overhead and reaching behind back, can’t hang washing easily, struggling with some client transfers.  
- Night pain if lies on L side, wakes a few times/wk. Baseline ~3–4/10, up to 7/10 with overhead.  
- No specific trauma/fall, coincided with extra shifts + more manual handling/overhead tasks.  
- Pt feels it “looks a bit puffy and rounded” vs R. No redness, no obvious warmth.  
- Past hx L rotator cuff tendinopathy dx here ~18/12 ago, improved with physio + simple analgesia. Mild for last ~6/12 until this flare.  
- Using ibuprofen 400 mg bd–tds prn, some benefit. Heat pack at night helps.  
- No neck pain, no paraesthesia, no dropping objects. No fevers, wt loss, night sweats.  
- Worried about “arthritis setting in properly now”. Still working FT but swapping heavier jobs with colleagues.

Meds today: just noted current self-use of ibuprofen 400 mg bd–tds prn; usual chronic meds in file, not reviewed. NKDA.

Exam (focused, L shoulder):  
- Vitals ok: BP 128/78, HR 76 reg, afebrile, sats 99% RA. Looks well, guarding L arm a bit.  
- Shoulder: no obvious deformity, maybe very slight fullness anterolateral L vs R, no erythema/warmth. Local tenderness over greater tuberosity/subacromial area. ACJ n/t.  
- AROM: abduction to ~110° limited by pain, FF ~130°, IR to L5, ER mildly ↓. PROM a bit better but painful at end range, not globally stiff.  
- Pain + slight weakness with resisted abduction/ER; IR preserved.  
- Pos painful arc, Jobe reproduces pain, Neer/Hawkins +ve. No instability signs.  
- Distal neurovasc intact. Neck full painless ROM.

Imp:  
1) L rotator cuff tendinopathy – flare, non-traumatic, likely overload from ↑ manual handling/overhead work. No red flags for tear/septic/inflammatory arthritis. Mild subjective “swelling” only. Clinical dx, same pattern as previous episode.  
2) Occupational strain – high manual handling/overhead tasks contributing.

Ix:  
- No imaging today – discussed, not likely to change initial mx, typical tendinopathy picture.  
- Will bundle routine bloods with next chronic disease review rather than today (pt short of time, and here just for shoulder).

Plan (a bit scattered discussion):  
- Reassured re no signs of acute tear/infection. Explained tendon “overloaded/irritated” rather than joint “wearing out”.  
- Activity: keep using within limits, avoid heavy overhead lifting and tasks that push pain much above usual. Can adjust duties at work; offered work cert if needed – declined for now.  
- Analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol 1 g qid prn (max 4 g/day).  
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg tds with food for up to 5–7 days for flare, then prn. Discussed to stop and see GP if any GI upset, black stools, ↓ urine, etc.  
- Exercises: advised gentle daily ROM (pendulums, wall slides) and simple isometrics for abduction/ER as tolerated, avoid big flare-ups.  
- Physio: internal referral to practice/Community Health physio today for structured rotator cuff loading program and work-related strategies. Asked to book at reception.  
- Discussed possible subacromial steroid injection if not settling with above – pt prefers to try exercises/physio first.

Safety net: RTC/ED if sudden severe pain, obvious big swelling/redness/heat, fever, or sudden loss of ability to lift arm after new injury, or new numbness/weakness. Otherwise review ~4/52 or earlier if worse.  

Billing: Standard consult, bulk billed (pt requested, finances tight).

[Addendum 22/11/25 16:05 – Dr K]  
Pt phoned – shoulder “about same”, just checking re work: ok to keep working if keeps within pain limits; reiterated earlier advice, no new orders. Will book physio next week + GP f/up in ~4 wks.
