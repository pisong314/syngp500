54F RN – review R shoulder  

HPI  
Known R rotator cuff tendinopathy ~3/12  
Pain a bit ↓ but now mainly stiffness esp am + after sitting/drive  
“Feels really stiff when I wake up” “if I’ve been at the nurses’ station a while it just seizes up”  
AM stiff ~20–30 mins → eases with gentle movement  
Dull ache lat R shoulder 3–4/10 rest, up to 6/10 OH activity  
Worse after heavy/manual handling at work  
No new injury, gradual onset after run of extra shifts  
Sleep: wakes if lies on R side too long  
Fnx: “hanging the washing and top cupboards are no good” avoiding OH stuff at work  
Taking ibuprofen 400 mg BD–TDS PRN (intermittent) – helps, no GI sx  
Doing some ROM ex “when I remember” – no structured prog  
Sometimes rests R arm completely on days off “worried I’ll wreck it more”  
Concerned re work set-up “they raised the computers so I’m reaching up more”  
Asks if this will “just wear out and need surgery”  

No red flags: no trauma, no true weakness/drop, no neck pain/radicular sx, no numb/tingle, no systemic sx, no other joints, no >1hr gen AM stiff

TTP greater tuberosity / anterolat shoulder  
ROM: active abd painful 70–120°, near full otherwise; ER mildly ↓ vs L w end-range pain; IR to mid T-spine, mild discomfort. Passive ROM slightly > active, no global loss → not frozen  
Mild pain-limited ↓ power abd/ER, otherwise 5/5

Ax  
R rotator cuff tendinopathy – overload pattern, no evidence tear/frozen shoulder/inflamm arthropathy  
Work/ergonomic contrib likely  
Mood ok, coping though frustrated  

Plan  
– Education brief: explained overuse/overload, usually self-limiting, can take months. Reassured no signs rupture/frozen shoulder/systemic disease. Imaging not indicated now  
– Activity mod: stay active, avoid complete rest. Continue work but ↓ heavy/repeated OH lifting where poss, use aids/team lift  
– Ex prog: simple RC + scap stabiliser loading ex shown (band/SL ER, supported abd, wall slides) – advised most days, mild discomfort ok, avoid sharp/prolonged ↑ pain  
– Meds:  
  • Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS max, short bursts only (≤5–7 days) w food. Discussed GI/renal risk, stop if dyspepsia/PR bleed  
  • Add topical NSAID gel (e.g. Voltaren 1%) QID PRN  
– Discussed steroid injection option for short-term relief if still intrusive despite good ex adherence – pt prefers to hold off for now  
– No ix today – will reconsider US/MRI if poor progress or new features  
– Advised brief chat with manager re ergonomics (monitor/keyboard height, ↓ OH tasks). Offered fit note if needed (declined today)  

Safety-net  
RTC earlier if sudden ↑ pain after minor injury, new true weakness (esp can’t actively abd), marked ↓ ROM, systemic sx, can’t cope at work  

F/U  
Review 4–6/52 re response to structured loading + work mods  
If still poor by ~3/12 w good adherence → consider formal physio + possible CSI  
If sig sx >6/12 despite supervised prog → consider imaging + ortho/sports review  

Pt verbalised plan, “I’ll actually do the exercises properly this time”
