- ↑ repetitive questioning some evening agitation pacing abit pre bed  
- nil aggression nil wandering nil self harm thoughts  

Pt "I know my memory’s not great but this feels real to me should I be worried or is it just the dementia getting worse"  concerned but not panicky in consult  

Daughter says mood "abit lower" but similar to usual  pt "have down days but I try to keep going"  nil SI "wouldnt do that"

Impression  
1 Mixed dementia with emerging BPSD  delusions mild agitation  
   Likely progression of dementia  low suspicion delirium  afebrile stable obs nil fluctuation GCS but will excl UTI metabolic etc  
   Currently distress low–mod risk to self/others low  

2 Depn on sertraline  stable  mild situational anx re new sx  

3 Urge urinary incontinence on oxybutynin  
   Significant anticholinergic burden  may be contributing to ↓cog and psych sx in dementia  

4 Vascular risk in mixed dementia  
   BP lipids appear controlled  continue secondary prevention  

Ix today  
- Urine MCS MSU today to excl UTI  
- Bloods  FBC UEC CRP LFTs TSH B12 folate RBG to screen metabolic / inflammatory cause for behaviour change  
- ECG baseline re donepezil and if future antipsychotic considered  QT / conduction  

Plan  
# Dementia / BPSD  
Explained to pt + daughter that such beliefs common in dementia esp as condition progresses  may wax/wane  
First step to rule out infection metabolic trigger  

Non pharm discussed  
- Maintain consistent evening routine  adequate lighting esp hallway / toilet  
- Avoid direct confrontation of delusions  suggest reassurance distraction eg "lets check the doors together"  
- Encourage gentle daytime activity short walks simple tasks to help sleep  
- Daughter to ensure glasses hearing aids etc used  check scripts up to date  

Safety / home  
- Doors windows lock ok per daughter  suggested simple chime / door sensor if concern  no restraints  
- Daughter to supervise stove oven use esp evenings  

Pharm  
- Continue donepezil 10mg nocte  
- Nil antipsychotic for now as distress + risk low  explained option of short term low dose risperidone in future if aggression or severe distress  discussed ↑stroke mortality risk in dementia  both prefer conservative approach  

# Depn  
- Continue sertraline 50mg mane  
- Encourage ongoing social contact seniors group etc  daughter to monitor for mood drop or SI  

# Urge incontinence / anticholinergic burden  
Discussed that oxybutynin can worsen memory confusion in older pts with dementia  family unaware  
Plan once Ix back  
- If UTI / other cause excluded and BPSD persists consider taper then cease oxybutynin  trial bladder training timed voiding ↓caffeine esp tea  
- Consider later switch to mirabegron (less central anticholinergic) depending on BP  will need longer r/v  
For now continue current dose to avoid abrupt change mid behaviour flare  flagged as priority for next long appt  

# Supports / admin  
Given daughter info Dementia Australia  Nat Dementia Helpline  DBMAS 24h line  
Requesting old GP and memory clinic letters + My Aged Care report for baseline cog scores and prior advice  
Briefly raised advance care planning and SDM  to cover properly at later long consult  

Safety net  
Advised pt + daughter to seek urgent r/v or ED if  
- sudden ↑confusion drowsiness or marked agitation  
- fever dysuria not passing urine  
- wandering aggression or any self harm thoughts  
Otherwise r/v routine  

Follow up  
Booked extended f/u 1–2/52 once urine bloods ECG available  
At next r/v  
- check for delirium / infection / metabolic issues  
- reassess delusions level of distress + risk  
- decide on oxybutynin taper and bladder mgmt  
- start more detailed care planning incl future resi care discussion
