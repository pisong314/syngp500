22/11/25  Walk‑in f/up 10 min only – “on break between shifts”

27M bartender

Reason: STI f/up + quick liver/food Qs  

HPI  
- Chlamydia urethritis dx 2/52 ago (urine NAAT CT+ve GC-ve)  
- Completed doxy 100 bd 7/7, no missed doses  
- Now: no dysuria, no discharge, no genital pain, no systemic sx  
- No new partners since Rx, last sex ~3/52 ago, MSM, no condoms  
- Aware needs partner notif – given Let Them Know link  
- Worried re “tap water at work” → reassured STI sexual, not water/food  

Known chronic Hep B (dx teens per pt, no previous f/up)  
- Recent bloods (reviewed today, SN path):  
  - HBsAg +ve, anti‑HBc +ve, anti‑HBs low → c/w chronic HBV  
  - Hep A IgG equivocal  
  - LFT: ALT 70↑, AST 48↑, GGT 110↑, ALP/bili N  
  - FBC, UEC N  
- ETOH: 3–4 std most shifts, ↑ on w/ends, plus “staff shots”  
- Late‑night fried food, energy drinks 2–3/shift  
- No red flag liver sx (no jaundice, abdo pain, ascites, PR bleed, wt loss)  

O/E (brief – pt rushing)  
Obs: BP 118/74 HR 78 RR 14 afeb SpO2 99% RA  
Gen well, in work clothes  
Abdo soft NT, no obvious HSM, no ascites clinically  
No jaundice seen  
GU exam offered – declined (asymptomatic, time)  

A  
1) Chlamydial urethritis – s/p doxy, now asx, likely resolved  
2) Ongoing STI risk – MSM, inconsistent condom use  
3) Chronic Hep B w mild transaminitis – needs staging + HCC surveillance  
4) ETOH + diet risk factors for liver disease  

P  
STI  
- No further abx  
- Re-test CT/GC urine NAAT @3/12 post Rx → form printed (SN path)  
- Repeat HIV/syphilis serology @3/12 post last exposure → ordered future  
- Partner notif reinforced, Let Them Know website given  
- Brief condom counsel, advised 3–6/12 STI screen ongoing  
- PrEP mentioned only (pt “no time today”) → discuss next long appt  

HBV / liver  
- Explained chronic HBV + mild ↑LFT, need proper workup to ↓ cirrhosis/HCC risk  
- Today (pt agreed quick bloods):  
  - LFT, FBC, INR  
  - HBV profile: HBeAg, anti‑HBe, HBV DNA viral load  
  - Hep A IgG repeat  
  - UEC (baseline if future antivirals/PrEP)  
  → SN path, results to HealthLink  
- RUQ USS liver + AFP ordered (HCC surveil + architecture) → form given, pt to book when off work  
- Plan: 20–30 min review 1–2/52 to go through HBV results, USS, consider hepatology/viral hepatitis clinic referral  

Diet / ETOH (very brief – time)  
- Suggested ↓ shots, aim some alcohol‑free days, any ↓ helpful esp w HBV  
- Quick advice re less fried options, ↓ energy drinks if poss  
- Full ETOH + diet counselling deferred to longer appt (pt will book on day off)  

Immunisation  
- HBV: HBsAg+ → no booster  
- Hep A immunity unclear → IgG ordered, vaccinate if non‑immune (next visit)  
- Flu/COVID boosters mentioned, pt declined today (time)  

Safety net  
- RTC/ED if jaundice, abdo swelling, haematemesis/melaena, confusion, fevers, new GU sx  
- Emphasised need for longer f/up for HBV, PrEP, immunisations  

Billing  
- Level B, bulk billed (brief, <15 min, multiple issues but very time‑limited)
