54M radiographer – f/up R ant chest/upper abdo swelling  

Hx  
Swelling/erythema/itch R upper abdo/chest wall “like sunburn that won’t go away”  
Onset vague – at least wks, prob months (prev note ~6/12 ago with erythema/pigment same area)  
?slightly ↑ puffiness since last review, no systemic sx (no fevers/chills/WL/NS)  
No dysphagia, N/V  
Occ superficial burning pain end of day after shifts  
Long hx occupational radiation exposure (diagnostic only, no RT) – area corresponds to where he rests cassettes/portable etc  
No known Ca. No regular meds recorded.  

O/E  
Obs: BP 132/78 HR 76 RR 14 T 36.7 SpO₂ 98% RA BMI 27  
Skin R upper abdo/chest just inf R costal margin ~8x6 cm: mild patchy erythema, slight oedema, peau d’orange, ↑pigment, mild thickening, no deep induration, no warmth, no fluct, no ulcer. Mild superficial TTP. Ax nodes -ve.  

Imp  
1. Chronic radiation-induced skin change with acute inflam flare R ant chest/upper abdo – superficial only, no cellulitis, no ulcer, no systemic red flags  
2. Ongoing occupational radiation exposure – needs more detailed OH review later  

Plan  
- Likely chronic rad dermatitis/fibrosis flare – explained probable work-related aetiology  
- Rx: mometasone furoate 0.1% cream OD thin layer to lesion x 7–10/7 then stop. Avoid broken skin  
- Emollient (sorbolene) BD/PRN (separate from steroid)  
- Analgesia: paracetamol 1 g PO QID PRN (max 4 g/day). No NSAID needed  
- Avoid local trauma/heat; cover from sun  

Ix  
- FBC, CRP, U&Es, LFTs ordered today (S&N) – baseline + r/o infection/inflam. Results pending  

Occ / rad safety  
- Briefly reinforced ALARA + PPE. Advised discuss with workplace rad safety officer re exposure / possible role mods if ongoing sx  
- Longer occ risk review / malignancy risk discussion next long appt (time today limited)  

Referrals  
- If no improvement or worsening → consider chest wall/abdo USS + telehealth derm or rad onc (regional centre) ± occ med  

Safety net  
- RTC/ED if rapid ↑ swelling, warmth, spreading erythema, fever, feels unwell, new ulcer/bleeding/nodular mass  

F/U  
- Review 2/52: check lesion response, review bloods, decide on USS / telehealth referral  
- Book separate long appt later for reflux/meds reconciliation + occupational risk discussion  

[No prior bloods for trend – will use today as baseline]
