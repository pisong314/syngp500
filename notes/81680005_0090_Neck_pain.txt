Telehealth video – pt at home Bendigo, GP in rooms. Bulk billed (MBS 91800).  

CC: “I’ve had diarrhoea for a few days now and I’m a bit worried.”  

HPI  
42F, known pt.  
Diarrhoea x4 days – ~4–6 loose/watery BMs/day, small–mod vol, no nocturnal sx. No blood or mucous. Mild crampy lower abdo pain pre–BM, settles after. No sig N/V (mild N day 1 only). No fevers/chills, home temp ~37.2. Feels “washed out” but drinking water + Hydralyte, passing urine reg (4–5/day, light yellow). No dizziness.  
Onset ~24hrs after takeaway chicken burger. No travel, no camping, no sick contacts.  
Finished amoxycillin/clavulanate 875/125 bd x7/7 for sinus ~2 wks ago, query “antibiotics mucked up my gut”.  
Took loperamide 2mg x2 doses day 2 with partial releif.  
Denies: severe abdo pain, persistant vomiting, weight loss, blood/black stool, recent hospital, immunosupression.  

Also mentions neck pain ~3–4 wks, R> L posterolateral neck into top of R shoulder, dull ache 2–3/10 baseline, up to 6/10 with laptop work/driving. No trauma. No arm weaknes, no numb/tingling, no headache red flags, no gait/bowel/bladder issues. Uses paracetamol 1g prn with some help.  

PMHx  
Generally well. No known IBD/coeliac. No prev neck injury.  

Meds  
- Paracetamol 1g prn (3–4 doses/week).  
- Nil reg NSAIDs.  
- Recent amoxycillin/clavulanate course as above.  
NKDA.  

Exam (video, limited)  
Looks mildly tired but not toxic. Talking in full sentances, NAD resp.  
Mucosa moist. No obvious pallor/jaundice.  
Self abdo palp – mild diffuse lower abdo tenderness only, no focal severe pain, can hop on spot without worsening.  
Neck ROM: some restriction R rotation and R lateral flexion, mild discomfort end range, otherwise ok. Moves limbs freely, no obvious neuro defecit on screen.  

Impression  
1) Acute watery diarrhoea – likely self-limiting infective gastro (viral/foodbourne) vs post-abx gut flora change. No red flags, low suspicion C. diff currently (freq only 4–6/day, no blood, no systemic toxicity, no recent hosp).  
2) Subacute mechanical/postural neck pain – no neuro sx/signs, no red flags.  

Plan  

1) Diarrhoea  
- Continue oral fluids + ORS (Hydralyte etc) – aim pale yellow urine.  
- Light bland diet as tollerated, avoid very fatty/spicy for now.  
- Loperamide 2mg prn ok for short term use if needs to work, max 8mg/day, stop if blood in stool or fever.  
- Avoid NSAIDs while bowels upset; paracetamol ok.  
- No tests today.  
- If persisting >7–10 days or worsens → stool MCS incl C. diff toxin + FBE, UEC, CRP (plan to send to Sullivan Nicolaides path, telehealth form to be emailed if needed).  
- Safety net: seek urgent review/ED if ↑freq >8–10 watery stools/day, blood/black stool, persistant vomiting, fever >38.5, severe abdo pain/distension, or dizziness/confusion/reduced urine.  

2) Neck pain  
- Reassured likely mechanical/postural. Encouraged to keep active, avoid prolonged stillness.  
- Simple neck ROM exercises within comfort, microbreaks from computer; raise laptop screen, use seperate keyboard/mouse if poss.  
- Analgesia:  
  - Continue paracetamol up to 1g q6h prn (max 4g/day).  
  - Once diarrhoea settled, may trial ibuprofen 400mg tds with food prn for up to 5–7 days if no hx renal/ulcer/CVD – PBS genric.  
- Heat pack to neck/upper back prn.  
- No opioids/benzos, no soft collar.  
- If persisting >2–3 more wks or impacting fxn, will refer to local physio in Bendigo or telehealth physio (pt aware access may be delayed). Imaging not indicated at this stage.  

Follow-up  
- Telehealth or in-person review in ~5–7 days if diarrhoea not clearly improving, earlier if any red flags.  
- Neck: if not improving or worsening over next 4–6 wks, book in-person for full neuro + MSK exam, consider imaging/referral then. RTC sooner if new neuro sx (arm weakness, numb/tingling, gait change, bowel/bladder issues, sevre night pain).  

Pt understands plan and agrees.
