P  
Rash  
- Avoid suspected triggers → stop new washing powder, re-wash recent clothes/linen w old/sensitive product, avoid new blouse  
- Hydrocortisone 1% cream thin layer BD to affected areas ≤7/7 (not face/broken skin)  
- Emollient (e.g. sorbolene/fragrance-free) TDS PRN  
- Cetirizine 10mg mane PRN itch (OTC, can use daily 3–5/7)  
- RTC/ED if facial/tongue swell, SOB, widespread blistering, feels acutely unwell. Review if not improving 5–7/7  

Neck pain  
- Reassured – no features of serious spinal pathology today  
- Encouraged keep active, avoid prolonged sitting; microbreaks at work, basic neck/shoulder stretches, improve ergonomics (screen height, keyboard/mouse, ↓phone flexion)  
- Analgesia:  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg TDS with food PRN up to 5–7/7 (no hx ulcer/renal/NSAID issues)  
  • Alt/paracetamol 1g QID (max 4g/d) if prefers or NSAID no good  
- Heat pack to neck/shoulders PRN, avoid high-velocity neck manipulation  
- If persisting >2–3/52 or functionally limiting → consider physio referral (posture/strength program)  
- Red flags explained – RTC urgently if new arm pain, numbness, weakness, gait/bowel/bladder change, systemic sx  

Ix: nil today – no indication  

F/up  
- Rash review PRN if no better 5–7/7 or earlier if worse
