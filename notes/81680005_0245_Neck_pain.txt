Plan  

L knee  
Education given re likely PFJ origin good prognosis w activity mod + strengthening  
Activity

Consider knee Xray if persisting >6/52 or new mech sx eg locking giving way sig effusion  

Neck  
Reassured likely muscular/postural serious pathology unlikely given normal neuro + nil red flags  
Encouraged to stay active avoid prolonged static postures  
Basic neck ROM + stretch exs shown brief handout / website given  
Heat pack 10–15min 2–3x/day  
Analgesia as per knee plan PRN to allow movement
