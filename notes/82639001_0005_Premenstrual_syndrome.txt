Plan  

# Throat / globus  
- Reassured re nil current red flag features for malignancy or sig thyroid dz  
- Explained link stress muscle tension reflux → globus sensation  
- Advice voice care  avoid shouting where possible  hydration  avoid habitual throat clearing  
- Simple comfort measures prn eg warm fluids lozenges  
- Reflux precautions for next 2–3/52  avoid large late meals caffeine excess ETOH near bedtime elevate HOB  
- Pt keen on tests "you cant just say its stress"  agreed to above bloods mainly for reassurance  
- Safety net  to R/V or seek urgent care if progressive dysphagia odynophagia persisting hoarseness >3–4/52 haemoptysis wt loss neck lump fevers night sweats  

# PMS / mood  
- Reviewed PMS dx  showed how diary fits luteal phase sx pattern  pt intermittently challenging "thats not what the internet says" but did accept sx improve after bleed starts  
- Discussed options (time limited)  
  1) Non drug  regular exercise sleep hygiene ↓ caffeine/ETOH premenstrual wk stress mgmt relaxation  pt sceptical "going for a walk wont fix my hormones" but will "try yoga again"  
  2) COC drospirenone/EE continuous use explained evidence for mood sx  pt declined strongly  
  3) SSRI eg sertraline 50mg daily luteal phase (ovulation → day 1–2 menses) discussed evidence + lower ongoing SE burden  pt very resistant felt this was "drugging" her  declined  
- As pt refusing 1st line pharm options today  
  - asked to continue prospective daily symptom diary at least next 2 full cycles  template re given  suggested phone app ok  explained needed if later considering meds or ?gynae / psych r/v  
  - printed info on PMS lifestyle COC SSRI given for pt to read fact check  
  - discussed non evidence based supplements e.g. chasteberry evening primrose  explained limited data cost  if chooses Vitex advised pharmacy brand stop if rash or SE  still need diary + lifestyle  
  - contraception  again recommended reliable method given wants to avoid preg and ?future meds  pt declined COC and LARC  agreed to be more consistent w condoms only  
- Nil current red flags MH  SI nil  nil psychosis  advised longer 20–30min MH appt if wanting to explore mood / stress or reconsider meds  

Meds  
- Nil scripts today  

Follow up  
- F/U 4–6/52 or earlier if  
  - throat sx persist or worsen or any red flag as above  
  - PMS / mood sx worsen impact safety or function or pt ready to reconsider COC/SSRI  
- Will r/v pathology when back  phone or brief face to face  
- asked to bring symptom diaries to next PMS r/v  without this difficult to justify specialist referral  

Pt advised to return if fever >38.5C severe SOB chest pain or confusion or if generally more unwell than expected
