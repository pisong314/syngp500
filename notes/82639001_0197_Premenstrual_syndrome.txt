Impr  
1) Resolving viral URTI s/p fever – clinically improving, no red flags  
2) PMS – mod, longstanding, clear luteal pattern, psych + physical sx, no inter-episode mood disorder, no SI. Prefers non-pharm initially  

Plan  
1) Viral  
– No Ix today  
– Cont rest, fluids, PRN paracetamol  
– Can trial ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN short-term if needed  
– RTC/ED if high fevers recur, SOB, pleuritic CP, severe HA/neck stiffness, dysuria/flank pain, rash, confusion  

2) PMS  
– Explained likely PMS vs PMDD / MDD (brief)  
– Start prospective charting x ≥2 cycles (given PMS diary/app suggestion)  
– Lifestyle: ↑exercise, sleep hygiene, ↓caffeine/alcohol premenstrually (pt drinks iced coffee – advised cut back in wk before)  
– Discussed options only today (time):  
   • COC (monophasic, consider 20mcg EE + drospirenone, possibly continuous)  
   • SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine/sertraline) continuous vs luteal-phase only  
Pt: “rather see if I can manage it without strong tablets first” → agreed no meds started today  

– Brief MH screen: no SI/SH, no persistent low mood. Safety-net: seek urgent help if mood drops badly or SI  

Ix  
Nil today. Consider FBC/TSH at PMS review if pattern unclear  

F/up  
Long appt 4–6/52 for PMS review + diary (prefer after ≥1 full cycle).  
Earlier if fever/Sx worsen or mood deteriorates. Pt: “if it settles I might not bother coming back” – encouraged review if still troublesome.
