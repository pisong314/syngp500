HPC  
Fever last wk – now resolved  
~6d ago sudden fevers, sweats, myalgias, mild HA, URTI sx (nasal + scratchy throat 2–3d, now gone), mild dry cough. No SOB beyond usual mild asthma. No urinary sx, no GI, no rash. No rigors. No thermometer. LMP 5d ago, fever started just pre-menses, settled by D2 bleed. Today feels “mostly back to normal, just a bit tired”  

Longstanding PMS – ↑ mood sx 7–10d pre-menses: irritability, tearful, “not coping at school”, breast tenderness, bloating, more migraines. Better by D1–2 bleed. Cycle reg 28–30d. No contraception. Not actively TTC but pregnancy acceptable. No SI.  

Hx migraine w/out aura – 1–2/mth, clusters in premenstrual wk. No red flags. Uses ibuprofen PRN only.

Ix  
Nil today – resolving viral picture  
Plan next visit: TSH, FBE, ferritin (PMS / fatigue w/up) – local path ok  

Impression  
1) Viral URTI w subjective fever – resolved, no focal source, low concern serious infxn  
2) PMS – mod, clear luteal pattern, signif fxnl impact, ?PMDD spectrum but inter-cycle mood ok  
3) Migraine w/out aura – premenstrual exacerbation  
4) Mild intermit asthma – stable  

Plan  
1) Viral illness  
– Reassure, no red flags today  
– RTC / ED if fever recurs >38 >3d, SOB, chest pain, rash, neck stiffness, feels more unwell  

2) PMS  
– Explained PMS vs PMDD briefly  
– Pt prefers non-hormonal initially, hesitant about COCP “mucking up hormones”  
– PMS symptom diary/app daily x ≥2 cycles → mood, physical sx, work impact  
– Discussed options (for future):  
   • COCP (cont/extended) reasonable given migraine w/out aura, non-smoker, but VTE risk + need stop if aura  
   • SSRI (eg sertraline) cont vs luteal-phase dosing – SEs discussed in brief  
– Book long appt 6–8/52 for PMS/migraine review once at least 1 full cycle charted  

3) Migraine  
– Continue simple analgesia (ibu/paracetamol) + rest at onset  
– Next review: consider PMS-directed Rx first (COCP vs luteal SSRI); if still problematic → migraine prophylaxis options  

4) Asthma  
– No change – PRN SABA only  
– Review technique/need for preventer at future routine visit  

F/up  
– Long appt 6–8/52 PMS + migraine + bloods (TSH/FBE/ferritin same day – local path)  
– Earlier if fever/resp sx worsen or mood deteriorates (esp low mood between periods or any SI)
