32F Chinese-Australian, software dev. Known astigmatism (optom 3/52 ago).  

CC: puffy eyes  

HPC  
~3/7 periorbital puffiness L>R. Worse on waking → ↓ during day. Now mild R side too. Describes “puffy and tight”, occasional mild itch. No sig pain, no discharge, no photophobia, no gritty FB sx. No trauma. No new creams/makeup. No URTI/sinus/dental sx. No SOB, ankle swelling, CP, orthopnoea, PND. No fevers, wt loss, night sweats.  
Pt convinced “the glasses have stuffed my eyes” and “this swelling is serious, that’s what the internet says”. Wants 2nd opinion re astigmatism dx.  

Meds: nil regular, occas ibuprofen. No eye drops. NKDA.  
SHx: high screen time, lives alone, non-smoker.  

OE  
Obs WNL: BP 112/68 HR 76 RR 14 T 36.7 SpO₂ 99% RA.  
Periorbital: mild bilat non-pitting puffiness infraorbital, L>R. No erythema/heat/tenderness, no crusting, no discharge, no urticaria/angioedema.  
Eyes: VA ~6/6 R 6/9 L with current specs. Conj clear, sclera white, cornea clear. PERRL, EOMI, no pain on movement, no proptosis, no chemosis. No hordeolum/chalazion.  
No peripheral oedema. Thyroid not ↑.  

A  
1) Mild bilat periorbital oedema – likely benign/localised. No red flags for preseptal/orbital cellulitis, no cardiorenal red flags. ?mild allergic / irritant / rubbing / fluid shift (sleep/screen). Sys causes (renal/thyroid) less likely currently.  
2) Astigmatism – stable, optom dx. Pt very unhappy w previous care, wants “a real eye specialist”.  

P  
Periorbital swelling  
- Reassured no evidence cellulitis/systemic oedema  
- Cool compresses prn, avoid rubbing, try improve sleep / screen breaks (briefly discussed)  
- Trial cetirizine 10mg mane PRN 3–5/7 if itchy / to see if allergic component (pt sceptical but agrees)  
- No bloods/urine today – plan UEC/CMP, FBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, urine ACR + dip if persists >2/52 or ↑, or if generalised swelling develops (“will check kidneys if it keeps going”)  

Astigmatism / visual concerns  
- Explained astigmatism = refractive error, not cause of soft tissue swelling (pt disagrees but aware)  
- Suggested gradual wear-in of specs; stop if severe HA/diplopia  
- Routine non-urgent ophthal referral done today for 2nd opinion + review of periorbital puffiness if ongoing  

Other  
- Pt raised multiple extra issues (tap water “making my face swell”, “hidden autoimmune”, wants “full body scan”) – deferred, advised longer appt if ongoing concern  

F/U  
- Review 1/52 or earlier if worse  
- ED/urgent review if ↑redness/heat/pain, fever, pain with eye movement, ↓vision, diplopia, severe HA, feels very crook  

Review 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – ignore, new plan as above.
