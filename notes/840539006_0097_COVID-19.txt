Assessment  
1 Suspected mild COVID-19 infection day 3 illness low risk adult vaccinated clinically stable by hx and TH exam  
   - Positive RAT last night albeit faint line  
   - URTI predominant picture afebrile-high 37s only  
2 Acute cough 2° viral URTI likely COVID  
3 Nil features currently to suggest pneumonia acute severe COVID PE or other serious pathology  

Differentials (discussed briefly)  
Other viral URTI incl influenza RSV etc  
However RAT + typical sx makes COVID most likely dx  

Plan / Management  
Symptomatic home based care  
- Rest fluids  
- Paracetamol 1g up to QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
- Can add ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN with food if further analgesia needed provided nil GI upset or contraindication  
- For cough  
  • Honey in warm water/tea  
  • Humidified air steam from shower etc  
  • OTC throat lozenges short term  
  • Avoid codeine linctus for now no strong indication  

COVID specific  
- Explained not in high risk group for severe disease young no comorbidities vax up to date so nil indication for oral antivirals under current National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce / PBS criteria  
- Advised to stay home while unwell avoid high risk settings aged care hospitals immunocompromised contacts generally for at least 7/7 from symptom onset and until clinically recovered as per current NSW Health guidance advised to check website as advice may change  
- Discussed mask use at home if partner high risk he is not per pt  
- Basic infection control hand hygiene surface cleaning  

Work  
- Adv pt to remain off work while symptomatic and coughing significantly  
- To follow employer + public health guidance re RTW after COVID  
- Offered med cert can be emailed if required pt will request if employer asks  

Vaccination / prevention  
- Confirmed boosters up to date  
- Pt asked re timing of next booster post infection “do I reset the clock after this”  
  Advised currently ATAGI generally suggests booster ~6/12 after confirmed infection or last dose but to check updated advice closer to time and discuss in detail with usual GP once recovered  

Long COVID discussion  
- Limited time but addressed briefly  
- Explained evidence evolving main modifiable factor = vaccination which she has  
- No proven acute intervention to reliably ↓ long COVID risk beyond usual good care  
- Advised if persistent sx beyond ~4–12/52 to r/v with usual GP for further assessment  

Safety net / red flags  
Advised urgent in person r/v ED or 000 if  
- ↑ SOB esp @ rest or when speaking  
- Chest pain or tightness  
- New confusion  
- Cyanosis  
- SpO2 ≤94% on her meter  
- High fevers >38.5 not responding to paracetamol/ibuprofen  
- Unable to maintain oral fluids  
- Haemoptysis severe pleuritic pain unilateral leg swelling  

F/U  
- TH or in person r/v with usual GP in 3–5/7 if not improving or earlier if any deterioration as above  
- Can repeat RAT before returning to higher risk exposure settings if unsure about recovery as per local guidance  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to repeat back key red flags “if I’m more short of breath chest pain or my oxygen drops I go straight to ED”  
Agreed with plan for home monitoring symptomatic tx and GP f/u
