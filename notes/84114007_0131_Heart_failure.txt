Last r/v cards noted hepatic congestion on USS and exam  

Last 2/52  
- ↑ abd bloating early satiety "fill up quickly then uncomfortable under right ribs"  
- RUQ pressure not sharp pain worse pm when more swollen  
- ↑ SOB on exertion now SOB after 1 flight stairs prev 2 flights nil SOB @rest nil PND nil orthopnoea sleeps on 2 pillows as usual  
- Ankles puff up by end of day improves o/n

Meds HF  
Perindopril 5 mg mane  
Bisoprolol 5 mg mane  
Frusemide 40 mg mane  
Empagliflozin 10 mg mane (for HF no DM)  
Adherence very good uses pill box nil NSAIDs nil herbal preps occas paracetamol  

Pt queries if meds esp diuretic "hurting my liver" also has ↑ fluids in hot weather and swapped to "herbal salt" assuming better than normal salt discussed both Na and fluid load can worsen congestion  

Mood coping but anxious re "liver congestion" nil depn sx  

Social  
Lives alone in unit metro area independent ADLs drives daughter nearby good support nil ETOH excess ~1 glass wine/wk non smoker

Prev labs (from 03/05/2023 15/08/2024 – copy forward) not all in today  
Last U&E Aug 2024 Cr 82 eGFR >60 K 4.3  LFTs WNL then  FBC WNL  
→ new bloods ordered today see plan  

A  
1 Chronic HFpEF with mild R-sided decompensation  
   - Peripheral oedema ↑ JVP tender hepatomegaly mild wt gain 1–2/52  
   - Nil clinical pulmonary oedema nil acute L-sided failure features  
2 Hepatic congestion 2° HF  
   - Likely cause RUQ pressure and "liver congestion" wording from cards  
   - No red flag liver sx but will check LFTs to excl other hepatic pathology  
3 Mild fluid overload  
   - Small but consistent wt ↑ 1.5 kg  
4 Anxiety re condition but coping no MH dx  

P  
# HF / congestion  
- ↑ frusemide 40 mg mane → 40 mg mane + 20 mg early pm (total 60 mg/d) for 5–7/7 then r/v  
- Continue perindopril bisoprolol empagliflozin unchanged  
- Daily wt strict same scales AM after void before breakfast  
  - If wt ↑ >2 kg in 2/7 or marked ↑ SOB swelling RUQ pain → GP same day or ED if severe SOB or chest pain  
- Fluid ~1.5 L/d while overloaded include tea coffee soup etc  
- Na restriction no-added-salt diet advised "herbal salt" often still Na based rec avoid read labels  
- Elevate legs when sitting avoid prolonged standing  

# Ix ordered today  
- U&E eGFR to monitor renal fxn on ↑ frusemide  
- LFTs to assess congestion vs other liver pathology  
- FBC screen anaemia infection  
- Request sent to cardiology rooms for copy of most recent echo report for GP file (last echo ~9/12 ago per pt)  

# Education / safety net  
- Explained in simple terms HFpEF → back pressure into liver + veins → swelling RUQ discomfort emphasised not primary liver disease on current info  
- Reassured meds unlikely to be "damaging liver" but monitoring via LFTs appropriate  
- Discussed SE of ↑ diuretic incl dehydration dizziness cramps electrolyte disturbance advised rise slowly maintain moderate fluids within 1.5 L target  
- Red flags orthopnoea PND SOB @rest rapid wt gain severe RUQ pain confusion chest pain → urgent care/ED  

Follow up  
- R/V 1/52 long appt to reassess sx wt BP oedema RUQ discomfort and check bloods may ↓ frusemide back to 40 mg if euvolaemic  
- Earlier r/v if deterioration as above  

Admin / billing  
- Bulk billed today  
- Knee aches briefly mentioned asked pt to book separate appt for that  

Pt engaged repeats key points accurately re daily wt fluid/Na restriction and red flags pt agreed to plan
