Pt worries  
Very health anxious frequent presenter tends to catastrophise

Social  
Lives with extended family rental some overcrowding mould in bathroom limited ability to fix landlord slow  
Works community support worker often hard to attend appts in hrs relies on aunt for lifts when unwell so transport can be an issue for extra r/vs or hospital appts  
Feels well supported by aunt and sister  

Family input  
Aunt waiting in car per pt says family also worried she “overdoes the googling” but happy she came in today

Assessment  
1 Acute febrile illness in pt with TB SLE anaemia  
   Most c/w uncomplicated viral URTI given short hx mild URTI sx clear chest stable obs workplace exposure to viral illness  
   Nil current red flags for TB relapse (no ↑cough no haemoptysis no wt loss no change night sweats)  
   Nil clear SLE flare features  
   Low suspicion malignancy today discussed at length  
2 Chronic fatigue multifactorial chronic disease + anaemia + poor sleep + high psychosocial stress + health anxiety  
   Mild recent worsening likely due to intercurrent viral illness  
3 Health anxiety prominent driving repeated requests for extensive testing need to balance reassurance vs over investigation  

Investigations today  
Aware pt immunologically complex but also resource constraints (rural pathology pickup once daily limited same day imaging) so kept tests targeted with clear safety net  
- Nasopharyngeal swab COVID/Flu A&B/RSV PCR  
- FBC CRP U&E LFT ESR  
Recent TSH B12 coeliac serology fasting BSL done 2/12 all normal so not repeated to avoid duplication cost and further anxiety  

Management / Plan  
Acute fever / likely viral URTI  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1g q6h PRN max 4g/24h advised avoid other paracetamol containing cold/flu preps  
- Fluids rest medical certificate for 2/7 off work given (bulk billed consult today)  
- Asked to avoid going into homes of very vulnerable clients till afebrile given TB hx + current viral sx  

TB / SLE / chronic issues  
- Continue TB meds as per TB clinic nil change today limited ability to liase with TB team on Sat clinic closed will send brief letter/secure msg Mon if any abnormals on bloods  
- Continue hydroxychloroquine usual dose  
- Iron: encouraged more regular use try with food to ↓GI upset plan formal anaemia r/v with iron studies at longer appt when not acutely unwell  

Sleep / fatigue  
- Brief sleep hygiene advice regular bedtime phone off in bed  
- Suggested ↓coffee to 1–2 cups day avoid after mid arvo  

Health anxiety  
- Validated concerns esp with TB + SLE background  
- Explained stepwise approach why broad cancer screen or CT “full body scan” not indicated now higher risk false positives more tests travel costs etc  
- Encouraged using reputable sites eg Healthdirect instead of late night random googling  
- Discussed option psych for CBT for health anxiety MHCP at future longer appt pt “maybe later want to see these results first”  

Resource / access issues  
- Pt relies on family for transport to town pathology and TB clinic if needs extra imaging (eg CXR) would need to travel to regional centre 70km away which is hard mid week around work so agreed to only escalate if clear red flags  
- Telehealth psych possible but pt says internet at home patchy will think about it  

Safety net  
- Red flag advice ED/000 if SOB CP confusion persistent high fever >38.5 despite regular paracetamol haemoptysis severe HA/neck stiffness or feels markedly more unwell  
- RTC or phone r/v if not improving 3–5/7 or new focal sx  
- If TB type sx (↑cough night sweats wt loss haemoptysis) to contact TB clinic urgently or present ED  

Follow up  
- Phone r/v 3–4/7 for PCR + blood results earlier if deterioration  
- Book long F2F in 2–3/52 for dedicated fatigue/anaemia/SLE/TB chronic care r/v incl iron studies MHCP discussion med rec preventive care etc
