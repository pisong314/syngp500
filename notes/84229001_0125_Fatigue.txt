Acknowledges overdue for DM r/v has been avoiding bloods  

T2DM

On metformin XR 1g mane previously daily now self ↓ to alt days ~1/12 to "stretch them out" and "dont like too many tablets"

A:  
1 Fatigue subacute 3–4/12 in 52F w known T2DM GAD BMI 30  
Extensive disc re ddx including  
- Poorly controlled T2DM / hyperglycaemia  
- Anaemia inc iron deficiency  
- Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroid)  
- Sleep related issues OSA less likely on hx but not excluded  
- Deconditioning lifestyle factors  
- Mood/anxiety contribution  
- Less likely but discussed need to consider if persists or abn tests malignancy chronic infection inflam arthropathy CKD CHF B12/folate def etc  
Nil current red flag features wt loss fevers focal neuro CP sig SOB GI blood loss but advised these can still develop  

2 T2DM likely suboptimally controlled adherence poor due to tablet concerns  
Overdue full DM review incl HbA1c renal screen lipids retinal etc  

3 GAD stable baseline contributing to avoidance of care and reluctance for meds/tests  

P:  
Extensive discussion held re nature of fatigue seriousness of potential causes benefits vs risks of investigation vs watchful waiting  
Explained rationale for bloods to check reversible causes esp given DM age 52 postmenopausal status  
Pt initially hesitant re "lots of blood tests" but after detailed explanation re consequences of missed dx eg anaemia malignancy thyroid disease uncontrolled DM agreed to limited targeted panel today  
Consent obtained for below  

Ix ordered today (on‑site pathology)  
- FBC  
- U&E eGFR electrolytes  
- LFT  
- HbA1c  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting glucose (if lab able next visit fasting)  
- TSH  
- Iron studies incl ferritin  
- B12 folate  
- Urine ACR + dipstick  

Documented that pt understands these tests may not give a single answer but help rule out serious pathology and guide safe med changes  

Meds  
Metformin XR 1g mane script renewed  
Dose clarified 1g PO mane with breakfast daily not alternate days 3/12 supply + 1 repeat PBS  
Discussed in detail role of metformin in ↓micro/macrovasc risk ↓BGL may help fatigue if hyperglycaemia contributing  
Discussed common GI SEs lactic acidosis risk in severe renal/hepatic impairment nil current C/I pending bloods  
Pt agreed to resume regular daily dosing from today  
No additional DM agent started today pending HbA1c renal fxn  

Discussed indication for ACEi/ARB and statin for CV and renal protection in T2DM incl absolute risk reduction stroke MI kidney disease as per RACGP guidelines  
Pt currently prefers to defer "dont want more pills"  
Documented that risks/benefits explained including ↑CV risk with DM particularly w FHx IHD  
Plan to revisit once results available  

Mental health  
Revisited option of SSRI and MHCP  
Pt feels anxiety manageable currently and primary concern fatigue  
Explained that if fatigue persists despite normal bloods will need more detailed MH review ?MHCP psych input  
Pt understands and agrees to re‑discuss at f/u  

Lifestyle  
Briefly discussed graded ↑activity eg 10–15min walk most days sleep hygiene ↓caffeine esp pm diet reg meals fewer processed foods  
Given time constraints today not explored in depth will r/v next appt  

Safety net / red flags  
Very explicit safety netting provided  
Advised urgent GP/ED if  
- new or ↑CP  
- sig SOB esp @rest  
- palps syncope  
- rapid unintentional wt loss  
- fevers >38 or drenching NS  
- focal neuro sx (weakness speech visual change)  
- PR bleed melaena or any concerning change in BO  
- any sudden marked worsening of fatigue or feeling "really unwell"  
Pt verbalises understanding able to repeat back key red flags  

Education / written info  
Provided written info re fatigue and T2DM self care (Healthdirect printout + NDSS brochure)  
Noted in record that written info given pt encouraged to read and bring Qs to next r/v  

F/U  
Plan f/u long appt 2–3/52 to go through results and reassess fatigue & DM control booking made today  
At next r/v if bloods back  
- adjust DM mgmt as per HbA1c consider metformin titration vs add second agent (eg SGLT2i vs DPP4i) depending on renal fxn PBS etc  
- reconsider statin + ACEi/ARB after discussing absolute risk numbers  
- more detailed MH sleep activity assessment ?MHCP if indicated  
- organise overdue DM complication screening retinal photography / optometrist formal foot exam +/- ECG  
Pt aware importance of attending given tendency to defer care explicitly advised not to wait until "completely exhausted"  

Pt states she understands and agrees with plan albeit abit ambivalent  

[Addendum 24/11/25 16:10 – Dr Lee]  
Pathology not yet resulted will check again 25/11 and contact pt if any urgent abn otherwise to discuss @planned r/v
