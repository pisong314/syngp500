32F RN, SA background, Aus resident  

Reason: “general check up” → fatigue  

Hx  
~3–4/12 ↑tired “bit more wiped out than usual” most days. Worse after late/long shifts, esp nights. Says “dragging myself through the day”, often needs to lie down after work. Still FT work but ↓gym (was 4x/wk → now 1–2).  
Sleep: 5–6h on work nights, 7–8h days off. Trouble winding down after nights, on phone in bed. No known snoring/apnoeas (lives alone). No waking SOB, no AM headaches.  
Assoc sx: mild tension-type HA, occasional postural light-headed. No SOB at rest, no CP, no palps, no oedema. No fevers, night sweats, rigors. No cough, haemoptysis. Wt stable (maybe -1–2kg, attributes to skipped meals).  
Mood: “bit flat and snappy after nights” but denies persistent low mood, anhedonia, SI. Still enjoys social time when not too tired. Work stress + double shifts, feels “probably just the hours and too much coffee”. Reluctant for meds/tests.  
Past TB lung ~5y ago o/seas, completed 6/12 Rx per pt, no issues since, no resp sx now. No known DM, thyroid, HIV, hep, autoimmune. Hx “low iron ages ago”.  
Meds: PRN ibuprofen, OTC multivit on/off. High caffeine (coffee + energy drinks nights). NKDA.  
SHx: RN rotating roster, frequent OT. Nonsmoker, minimal EtOH, no rec drugs.  

Telehealth → no exam / obs  

Impression  
1) Fatigue subacute–chronic, likely multifactorial (shift work + poor sleep hygiene + high caffeine + irregular diet ± IDA / metabolic / thyroid / vit deficiency). No red flag features on hx.  
2) Hx pulmonary TB, treated, quiescent by hx. Low suspicion relapse but given hx + fatigue + HCW → screen.  
3) Occupational stress / shift-work related issues, no clear MDD currently but monitor.  

Plan  
Ix (forms emailed + in EMR, local path):  
- FBC, ESR, CRP  
- U&E, LFT  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c, fasting lipids  
- Iron studies (ferritin, iron, transferrin sat)  
- B12, folate, Vit D  
- TSH, fT4  
- Quantiferon TB (IGRA)  
- HIV, Hep B, Hep C serology (discussed occupational risk, pt consents)  
- Serum β-hCG  
- Urinalysis (MSU if abn)  

F2F review 1–2/52 → BP, HR, Wt/BMI, full cardioresp + abdo. Will give CXR req then (TB hx + fatigue). Consider further (sleep study / MH plan / specialist) depending on results + ongoing sx.  

Advice (brief)  
- Cut out energy drinks, limit coffee ≤2/day, avoid caffeine close to sleep.  
- Try better wind-down after nights, minimise phone in bed.  
- Encouraged small regular meals on shift, gentle ex as tolerated.  
- Discuss with NUM re OT if ongoing.  

Red flags discussed: seek urgent review/ED if SOB, CP, palps + dizziness/syncope, high fevers, night sweats, haemoptysis, rapid wt loss, focal neuro sx, or if feels “really crook”.  

Pt initially wanted to “just cut back on coffee first” but agreed to targeted bloods, keen to avoid unnecessary meds/referrals.  

Follow-up: std 15 min F2F booked ~1–2/52
