# Reason for visit  
F/U epilepsy EEG result  

28yo male Down syndrome dev delay attends with support worker  

# HPI  
Known generalised epilepsy since childhood on sodium valproate under neuro tertiary hosp  

Recent routine EEG via neuro family told "slow spike wave"  
Pt: "probably dont need to be here but brain test was a bit funny"  
Support worker has note from mum ?Lennox-Gastaut after googling wants explanation reassurance  

Sz hx  
- Last clear GTC ~8/12 ago  
- Ongoing brief "blank spells" 1–2/mth few sec no falls no incontinence rapid recovery  
- Nil recent drop attacks nil clusters nil ED  
- Nil status ever per SW  

Triggers  
Mum feels "too much Coke" makes him "funny" pt says ↑soft drink @work recent wonders if why EEG abn  

Meds unchanged recently nil missed doses reported (parents give meds at home)  
Sleep ok in bed ~9pm up 6–7am  
Nil recent head injury tongue bite fever systemic illness  
Mood stable enjoys work SW: nil behaviour change  

Main concern info seeking re EEG "want to know if my brain is ok"  

# PMHx  
- Epilepsy presumed generalised slow spike wave pattern ?Lennox-Gastaut spectrum not clearly labelled in our file  
- Down syndrome  
- Dev/intellectual disability mod  
- Nil known cardiac resp or other sig chronic dz  

# Meds  
- Sodium valproate EC 500mg BD  
- Melatonin 2mg nocte PRN few nights/wk per family  
NKDA  

Today  
→ No med change to AED pending neuro  
→ Suggested trial ↓caffeinated soft drink esp @work discussed with SW  

# FHx / SHx  
Lives with parents suburban Sydney parents manage meds appts  
Supported employment 4d/wk enjoys routine  
Does not drive nil ETOH tobacco illicits  
NDIS participant (per SW) bulk billed today  

# Carer input  
Support worker confirms baseline function stable  
Mum (via written note) worried re ?LGS asks about NDIS review and "heart check for Down syndrome"  

# Exam  
Gen pleasant coop mildly anxious reassurable  
Obs BP 118/72 HR 76 RR 14 Temp 36.6 SpO2 99% RA  
CVS HS dual nil murmur chest clear  
Neuro  
- Alert oriented person place knows "November nearly Christmas" not exact date baseline  
- CN grossly intact  
- Power 5/5 all limbs nil focal deficit  
- Gait slightly broad based but stable baseline  
Psych behaviour engaged asks for clarification accepts reassurance  

# Ix  
Today  
- No access to formal EEG report or latest neuro letter (not in MHR yet)  
Prev labs ~6/12 ago LFT FBC U&E WNL on valproate  

Ordered today  
- FBC U&E LFT TFT for valproate monitoring gen screen bulk billed  

# Assessment  
1 Epilepsy gen slow spike wave EEG clinically stable  
   - Known epilepsy + dev disability + DS pattern c/w Lennox-Gastaut spectrum though dx not clearly documented  
   - Clinically reasonable control on current valproate last GTC 8/12 brief absences only  
   - Nil red flags today nil ↑freq nil new type nil injury  
   - Explained "slow spike wave" as EEG pattern often seen in established epilepsy syndromes does not = new damage reinforces existing dx  
   - Emphasised clinical picture > EEG alone  

2 Down syndrome dev/intellectual disability  
   - Needs simple explanations family involvement  
   - Nil acute behavioural or functional change  

3 Long term sodium valproate use  
   - Monitoring due labs ordered  
   - Needs ongoing neuro review at least annually  

4 Care coordination / parental queries  
   - Mum query NDIS review and "heart check" for DS important but needs longer appt with parent present defer to longer review 4–6/52  

# Plan  
Epilepsy / EEG  
- Continue sodium valproate EC 500mg BD no dose change today  
- Reassured pt SW  
  "brain test shows pattern common in people who already have epilepsy like you it helps specialists pick meds doesnt mean brain getting worse"  
- Education re red flags  
  - Call 000 or ED if sz >5min repeated sz without full recovery major injury or breathing concern  
  - If ↑freq new drop attacks change in pattern → urgent GP r/v and contact neuro clinic  

Lifestyle  
- Maintain regular sleep routine  
- Aim ↓large amounts sugary caffeinated soft drink explained caffeine sugar can sometimes ↓sz threshold though not cause EEG change  
- Avoid ETOH illicit drugs (already abstinent)  

Coordination  
- Asked SW to request mum email or fax copies of recent EEG report + latest neuro letter to practice  
- Will send brief letter to neuro once EEG report seen summarising todays findings asking for confirmation of syndrome label and any planned med adjustments  
- Note sent home via SW to parents re above and to keep upcoming neuro appt bring any sz diary  

Monitoring  
- Pathology forms given FBC U&E LFT TFT to be done next 1/52 SW to remind parents  
- Will check valproate monitoring schedule once neuro letter available  

Deferred issues  
- NDIS review and cardiac screening for DS to be addressed separate longer appt with mother present suggested long appt within 4–6/52  

Safety net  
- Pt SW advised to book earlier GP r/v if any ↑szs new neuro sx behaviour change or concerns from family  
- Generic advice given re seeking urgent care if acutely unwell fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion etc  

Follow up  
- GP f/u 2–3/52  
  - Review bloods  
  - Check sz pattern  
  - Hopefully have EEG + neuro letter to formalise dx long term plan  
- Further r/v PRN
