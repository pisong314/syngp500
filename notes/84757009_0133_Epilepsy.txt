MH / health anxiety  
Longstanding health anx re brain  
Frequent googling seizures cancer stroke  
Mum reports multiple prior GP/ED attendances for minor sx  
Today repeatedly asking for "MRI every few months"  
Nil SI  

# Telehealth limitations  
Phone only nil exam vitals  
No direct witness of events relying on description  

# Exam (tele)  
Speaking in full sentences mildly anxious  
Oriented chatting appropriately  
No obvious dysarthria word finding problem or confusion on phone per brief screen  

# Impression / Dx  
1 Epilepsy – focal aware motor sz R arm/face ± speech arrest  
   - Known symptomatic epilepsy 2° tuberous sclerosis  
   - Mild ↑ frequency last 3/52  
   - Pattern same as baseline per mum  
   - Nil features from hx to suggest acute stroke CNS infection SOL or status  
   - Needs non urgent but timely neuro r/v drug levels consider regimen tweak MRI timing  
2 Tuberous sclerosis w ID dev delay  
   - Chronic appears stable by hx nil new focal neuro deficit raised ICP sx  
3 Health anxiety re epilepsy brain pathology  
   - Driving help‑seeking request for repeated imaging  

# Plan  

Epilepsy / safety  
- Reassured pt mum that focal seizures from one side brain typical for his known dx not by itself proof of "cancer or stroke"  
- Explained occasional clusters can occur even when on meds  
- No med dose change today over phone without levels / specialist letters  
  → continue valproate 500 BD lamotrigine 100 BD everolimus 5 mane as currently  
- Discussed likely triggers poor sleep high caffeine energy drinks  
  advised ↓/stop energy drinks aim reg sleep consistent dosing times  
  linked these as more likely cause than "chemicals damaging the brain"  

Red flag / ED advice (safety net – standard)  
- Any seizure >5min or repeated sz without full recovery → call 000 attend ED  
- New persistent weakness facial droop speech difficulty vision loss severe sudden HA ↓ GCS fever or head injury w sz → ED  
- Also advised usual resp safety net pt to return if fever >38.5 severe SOB CP or confusion  

Monitoring  
- Asked pt mum to keep simple sz diary over next 4/52  
  date time duration R vs L side triggers recovery use for future med adjust  

Ix – ordered non urgent bloods (to do in person next 1–2/52)  
- FBC UEC LFT  
- Valproate level  
- Lamotrigine level (if lab able – noted on form)  
- Lipids fasting BSL / HbA1c baseline given everolimus + AEDs  

Referrals / records  
- Will prepare non urgent ref to adult neurologist w epilepsy / tuberous sclerosis interest at nearest tertiary centre  
  aims  
  • review sz control  
  • rationalise AEDs  
  • review everolimus indication dose monitoring  
  • consider timing/need for repeat MRI brain rather than serial scans via GP  
- Asked mum to bring any old neuro letters imaging reports to next F2F  

Health anxiety  
- Validated fears gently challenged catastrophic thoughts  
- Clarified "focal seizure starting on one side" is description of usual epilepsy type not new dx  
- Briefly mentioned option of psych input / MHCP later to help w health anx coping w chronic epilepsy  defer detailed discn today  

Driving / work safety  
- Reconfirmed must not drive per Austroads until cleared by neuro  
- Suggested ensure written seizure safety plan at workshop staff know when to call 000 etc can update once neuro r/v done  

F/U  
- Book F2F appt this clinic 1–2/52 or earlier if ↑ sz freq or any red flags  
  → check bloods vitals brief neuro exam review sz diary finalise neuro ref  
- Pt mum verbalised understanding of plan still abit anxious but settled once clear steps outlined
