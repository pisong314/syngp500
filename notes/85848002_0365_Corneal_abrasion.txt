22/11/25  Home visit – rural – f/up L eye

82F known to practice. Seen UC 3/7 ago for L corneal abrasion (fingernail while putting glasses on). On chlorsig gtts + ung since.

HPC  
L eye much improved  
“Was really scratchy Mon, now just a bit irritating”  
No ↑ pain, no photophobia, no ↓ vision from usual (“still blurry w/out glasses, same as always”)  
No mucopurulent dc, only watery tearing  
No FB since original event  
No CL use  
Using chlorsig 0.5% gtts L QID, 1% ung nocte (self ↓ from QID due to smeary vision)  
Wants repeat “just in case” – chemist closes early wknds, limited transport

PMHx: no known glaucoma, no prev corneal injury, no CL. No known drug allergies. No anticoag. Other comorbidities not discussed today – time

O/E  
Gen: well, NAD  
Obs: BP 134/76 HR 76 reg RR 14 afebrile SpO₂ 98% RA  
Eyes: R eye NAD  
L eye – mild lat conjunctival injection, no lid oedema, no periorbital erythema/tenderness  
Cornea torch exam: central clear, faint linear haze inferolat c/w healing abrasion, no obvious FB, no ulcer/infiltrate seen  
Pupils equal, reactive, no RAPD. EOMI, no pain on movement  
VA approx with glasses: R 6/12 L 6/12 (per prior notes – baseline)  
No photophobia provoked

Dx  
Healing corneal abrasion L (fingernail) – uncomplicated, improving, low risk (no CL, no red flags)

Plan  
– Continue chloramphenicol 0.5% gtts L QID until pain-free 24–48 hrs then stop  
– Continue chloramphenicol 1% ung L nocte x ~3–5 nights then cease if asymptomatic  
– Provided repeat scripts today (rural / access issues) → advised total course not >5–7 days unless reviewed  
– Reassured cause = mechanical scratch, not reading position / tap water; avoid rubbing eye / tap water rinses  
– Sunglasses if sensitive

Safety-net  
– Urgent review ED/UC if ↑ pain or pain returns after settling, new photophobia, ↑ redness/swelling, pus-like dc, or any ↓ vision / new visual disturbance  
– PN phone f/up 3/7 to check progress → review (home or clinic) if any concern

Pt engaged, asking about “side effects” of chlorsig – reassured for short course, report rash/swelling/severe irritation. Time limited, other preventive issues deferred – book separate appt when eye settled.
