U&E eGFR 82 stable  
LFT FBE TFTs prolactin all WNL  
AM total testosterone low–normal within lab ref borderline only  

Imp  
1 ED multifactorial likely organic 2' diabetes age vascular risk + signif anxiety component nil red flags malignancy/Peyronies endocrine screen essentially unremarkable borderline T only ?no clear indication TRT  
2 T2DM suboptimal but improving control  
3 ↑CV risk due to age male T2DM lipids but functionally low risk for sexual activity able 2 flights stairs nil angina or HF sx  
4 Health anxiety prominent today driving catastrophic thoughts re ED  

Plan / Mx  
ED  
Procedure style discussion re sexual activity clearance  
- Functional cardiac assessment via history able ≥2 flights stairs nil sx → cleared for resumption sexual activity and trial PDE5i  
- Start sildenafil 50mg PO ~1h pre intercourse max once/24h PBS script given  
- Counselling re need sexual stimulation avoid high fat meal common SE headache flushing nasal cong dyspepsia dizziness rare visual ∴ RTC if visual change or sig SE  
- Strict warning nil use w nitrates / amyl nitrite if ever needs GTN must not have taken sildenafil in prior 24h  
- Adv may need ↑dose to 100mg if inadequate response will r/v 4–6/52  

Diabetes / CV risk  
- Continue metformin XR 1g mane gliclazide MR 60mg mane atorvastatin 40mg nocte meds unchanged today  
- Brief lifestyle chat re wt loss ↑activity etoh ≤2 std drinks when he does drink  
- Plan full annual DM r/v feet eyes urine ACR BP in ~3/12 longer appt  

Health anxiety  
- Explained ED link w vascular risk but reassured nil current evidence malignancy major hormone prob or overt CVD  
- Suggested psych / CBT for health anxiety +/− couples therapy pt prefers wait see sildenafil effect ?later MHCP  

Safety net  
RTC earlier if CP esp on exertion or w sex SOB new ↓exercise tolerance visual sx on sildenafil or ED sx worsening  
Otherwise f/u 4–6/52 re ED response BP DM control
