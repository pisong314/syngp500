58yo M, accountant, f/up “problems downstairs – still can’t really get it up properly”.  

Seen here ~last month? (checked: ED review ~5 wks ago, started sildenafil 50 mg PRN).  

PC / Hx all mixed together  
- Ongoing ED. Trouble both getting and keeping erection for penetration, “just fizzles out”.  
- Has used “the little blue one” a few times, dose unclear to him, timing erratic (“just take one when I remember”). Sometimes mild effect, often none.  
- Occasional weak early morning erections.  
- Long-term wife, sex infrequent now, he’s avoiding due to performance worries. Says she is supportive but wants it sorted.  
- Feels a bit low about it, anxious before sex, but denies major depression, no SI.  
- No penile pain, no curvature or plaques by history.  
- No dysuria, haematuria, discharge. Mild nocturia x1, no hesitancy/poor stream.  
- No chest pain, no SOB, no exertional sx; can walk a few blocks / climb 2 flights stairs slowly.  
- Wonders if coffee + sitting in new office chair “cutting off circulation” is cause – reassured unlikely main issue.  

PMHx/meds (very limited)  
- Says “pretty healthy”, no known DM, IHD, stroke. Unsure re past high BP.  
- Current meds: sildenafil 50 mg PRN from this clinic, occasional ibuprofen. No nitrates, no poppers.  
- NKDA.  

Exam (brief – time)  
- Overweight but well, a bit anxious talking about sex.  
- BP 142/88, HR 78 reg, afebrile, SpO2 98% RA.  
- BMI ~30 (96 kg, 178 cm).  
- CVS/resp/abd unremarkable on quick check.  
- GU exam deferred today (no red flags by hx).  

Impression (scribbled)  
- Erectile dysfunction – likely multifactorial (vascular risk + psychogenic/performance anxiety). Inadequate trial of sildenafil due to poor understanding of timing/dose.  
- Cardiometabolic risk factors: overweight, probably sedentary, borderline BP, ?FHx heart disease (vague). Needs proper workup – ED may be early marker of vascular disease.  

Plan (ran out of time for long counselling)  
- Explained briefly common causes of ED, not due to chair/coffee alone.  
- Clarified sildenafil use:  
  • Continue sildenafil 50 mg, 1 tab ~1 hr before sex, avoid heavy/fatty meal, max once/24 hrs.  
  • Asked to keep simple log: timing, food, erection quality, side effects.  
  • Will consider ↑ to 100 mg if poor response and no issues, after results.  
  • Reiterated NO nitrates.  
- Bloods ordered today (fasting):  
  • FBC, U&E/eGFR  
  • Fasting BSL + HbA1c  
  • Fasting lipids  
  • LFTs  
  • TSH  
  • Morning total testosterone, SHBG, LH  
  • Prolactin  
  • PSA (discussed briefly, pt agreed).  
- Very brief lifestyle chat: advised more exercise, cut down cigs/alcohol, weight loss – will do proper CVD risk review when results back.  
- Mentioned psychosexual therapy as option for performance anxiety – he’ll think about it.  

Follow-up  
- Book long appt 2–3 wks to review bloods, repeat BP, reassess ED response to properly used sildenafil, and discuss next steps (dose change vs tadalafil, referrals, CVD risk).  
- Safety-net: seek urgent care if chest pain/SOB with sex or meds, visual changes, or prolonged painful erection.
