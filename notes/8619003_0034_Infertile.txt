CC: "sex pain" + ED + trouble conceiving  

HPC  
Sex pain ~8–9/12. "Pulling, burning pain in the shaft towards the tip" with penetration/ejac esp. "right when I finish". Nil pain at rest. Nil sores, ulcers, discharge, dysuria, haematuria, haematospermia. Mild perineal ache after (2/10 "like I’ve been kicked there but not bad").  

ED ~12/12, gradual. Difficulty getting/keeping erection, worse with stress. Some ↓AM erections but still present "not as strong as they used to be". Past use online herbal "performance" tabs, none x 2/12.  

Infertility: Trying for baby with wife ~18/12, regular unprotected sex, no pregnancies. Using apps to time ovulation. Pt worried "maybe the Wi‑Fi in my pocket is cooking my swimmers". Wife 32, reg periods, being worked up by her GP. Pt quite distressed, performance anxiety, "pretty down on myself".

BP 128/78 HR 76 afebrile BMI 29  
GU (with nurse chaperone): penis WNL, no plaques/curvature/lesions, no discharge. Testes bilat descended, normal size/consistency, no masses. Mild soft L varicocele on Valsalva, NT. No hernia. DRE not done today (time, low suspicion).  

Ix ordered (S&N / QML)  
- FBE, U&E, LFT  
- Fasting BSL, HbA1c, fasting lipids  
- AM total testosterone, SHBG, LH, FSH, prolactin  
- TSH  
- Urine MCS  
- First‑void urine CT/GC NAAT  
- Semen analysis x1 (repeat in 4/52 if abn) – instructions given (2–7 days abstinence, prompt drop‑off)  

A  
1) Male dyspareunia – penile shaft pain with intercourse/ejac, exam benign. ?chronic prostatitis / pelvic pain vs psychosexual. Peyronie’s/STI less likely (no curvature, lesions, discharge, low‑risk hx).  
2) Couple infertility (18/12 trying) – meets definition. Possible male factor: L varicocele, lifestyle, ED.  
3) ED – likely multifactorial (stress/performance anxiety, overweight, smoker, ?early metabolic/vascular). Needs full ED workup.  
4) Psychological distress re fertility + sexual function – subthreshold mood/anxiety but impacting relationship.  

P  
- Path as above – await results.  
- Semen analysis booked – pt to attend local path collection centre.  
- Conservative for pain: regular ejaculation, simple analgesia PRN around intercourse. If urine/CT/GC neg and sx persist → consider trial α‑blocker and/or empiric abx, +/‑ urology referral.  
- Lifestyle briefly discussed: strongly advised smoking ↓/quit, ↓EtOH, avoid cannabis esp while TTC, modest wt loss, avoid testicular heat. Reassured phone/Wi‑Fi unlikely major issue but can keep phone out of front pocket if he wants.  
- ED: explained need to check CV risk + hormones before PDE5i. No script today – will review once results back and do fuller ED hx. Suggested reduce performance pressure, avoid sex when very tired/intox.  
- Psych support: discussed option psych/sex therapist; pt prefers to "see what the tests say first".  

Safety net: RTC/ED if acute severe testicular pain, swelling, fever, new dysuria/haematuria, penile ulcers or discharge.  

F/U  
Long appt 2–3/52 → review bloods, urine, CT/GC, semen. Complete ED assessment, consider PDE5i if safe. Reassess pain; consider urology/fertility referral depending on results.
