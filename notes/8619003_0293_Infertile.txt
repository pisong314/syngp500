32F G0 endometriosis hx here to "go through the fertility tests you ordered" + next steps TTC  

Hx  
TTC ~18/12, regular unprotected IC  
Cycles 28–30d, 5–6d bleed, day1–2 dysmenorrhoea only, no IMB/PCB  
No galactorrhoea, wt stable  
Known endo – lap + excision ~3y ago, mild–mod, pain much better, occasional deep dyspareunia only  
No PID/STI hx  
Partner 34M, well, no known male factor per pt  

Pt today  
Well read, tracking cycles + LH kits "like we talked about"  
Worried endo "made things worse again"  
Asks re stress / kids’ bugs / “natural” cleaning spray → reassured unlikely major factor vs age/endo  

Ix reviewed  
Day 3 bloods: FSH 7, LH 5, E2 180, PRL 260, TSH 1.7 → all wnl  
Day 21 prog 34 nmol/L → ovulatory  
AMH 8 pmol/L (lab 7–30) → low‑normal for age  
Pelvic TVUS: uterus + endometrium NAD, ovaries normal vol, AFC ok, no PCOS, no hydrosalpinx, no large endometrioma, ?minor adhesions L adnexa only  
Semen analysis: vol/count/motility/morph all wnl → no sig male factor  

Exam  
Vital signs stable, BMI ~24, looks well, a bit teary when IVF mentioned  

A/P  
1) Primary infertility 18/12, 32F, regular ovulation, low‑normal ovarian reserve, normal USS, normal SA  
   → likely endo‑related tubal/peritoneal factor ± age  
   → no e/o PCOS, thyroid, hyperPRL, anovulation  
2) Endometriosis s/p lap/excision, currently stable, main issue fertility not pain  
3) Mild stress re TTC, coping OK  

Plan  
- Explained results briefly: ovulating; AMH ↓ side of normal → don’t sit on this too long; no obvious male factor  
- Meets criteria infertility >12/12 TTC + known endo  
- E‑referral today to fertility clinic (public pathway requested) → for tubal assessment (HSG/HyCoSy vs lap + dye) + discussion re OI+IUI vs IVF depending findings  
- No further hormone tests from GP at this stage – await FS input  
- Continue prenatal with folate  
- OK to use ibuprofen PRN for period pain but avoid around ovulation / if ?preg  
- Safety net: advise urgent review if severe pelvic pain, fever, heavy PV bleed, or +ve preg test with pain/bleeding (ectopic risk)  
- Pt aware IVF costs an issue, prefers stepwise escalation – documented in referral  
- Asked to bring FS letters/results back for ongoing shared care  

F/up GP 6–8/52 or earlier if FS appt delayed or concerns  

Billing: Level C, private, gap $40
