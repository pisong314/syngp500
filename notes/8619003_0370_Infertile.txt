34yo male  new pt  

# Reason for visit  
Concern re fertility and ↓libido  
Pt: "worried our sex life is so infrequent and might be stuffing up our chances of conceiving"  

# History  
- 34yo Anglo-Australian male warehouse worker on rotating shifts incl nights  
- With female partner 32yo 4yrs together TTC ~18/12  
- Intercourse approx once every 2–3 wks  pt: "between shifts and my low drive it just doesnt happen much"  
- Has read they should aim q2–3/7 around ovulation worried "we are missing the fertile window" extensive discussion re normal variation in frequency and impact on conception rates  
- Gradual ↓libido over last 1–2yrs  also ↓morning erections and erections "less robust" though usually able to penetrate  nil ejaculatory pain  nil haematospermia  
- Seen private fertility clinic ~4/12 ago  told semen count and motility "borderline to low" and testosterone "on the low side"  results not available today  strongly advised today to obtain written copies  
- Previous GP dx "androgen deficiency" ~12 mths ago  commenced testosterone gel for few mths then ceased ~4–5/12 ago after fertility clinic advised it could ↓sperm count  pt aware exogenous T can act as contraceptive  extensive discussion today re HPT axis and spermatogenesis  
- Since stopping T gel libido remains low  main question today whether infrequent sex vs endocrine issue  specifically asks if low T and borderline SA could explain both ↓libido + infertility

- Primary testicular failure less likely given exam and onset  
- Central hypogonadism (?pituitary) less likely but discussed incl red flags eg headaches VF changes galactorrhoea

# Assessment  
1) Suspected male factor infertility 8619003  
- Couple TTC ~18/12 without conception partner 32yo reg cycles  
- Prior SA reportedly borderline/low count + motility  details unknown  exogenous T use until ~4–5/12 ago likely suppressed spermatogenesis  discussed recovery can take >3/12 sometimes longer  
- Infrequent intercourse q2–3 wks likely significant contributor  explained optimal frequency q2–3/7 esp mid cycle  
- Exam reassuring  normal testic volume virilisation  nil structural abn  
- Need objective SA and hormonal data  

2) Possible androgen deficiency current status unclear  
- Sx: ↓libido ↓spont erections  however normal virilisation and testic volume  BMI borderline obese  shift work  
- Need to distinguish true hypogonadism (primary vs central) vs functional / relative low T related to wt sleep stress etc  
- Exogenous T contraindicated while TTC  discussed in detail incl risk of further ↓sperm count  pt verbalises understanding and agrees to avoid T pre conception  

3) Sexual function / low frequency intercourse  
- Multifactorial  shift pattern fatigue ↓libido performance anxiety  mild ED features but still achieving penetration most of time  nil clear organic ED at present  

4) Overweight BMI 29  
- Likely contributing to ↓T and reduced semen parameters  discussed role of wt loss and exercise  

Differentials discussed at length incl  
- Primary testicular failure  
- Central hypogonadism eg pituitary adenoma  
- Hyperprolactinaemia  
- Thyroid dysfunction  
- Medication or substance induced (nil clear culprit)  
- Pure psychosexual / relational issue  

Pt advised serious causes such as pituitary pathology unlikely given current hx/exam but not excluded until bloods available  pt reassured but understands need for formal workup

- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting glucose or HbA1c  

Explained need for at least one repeat morning T if low before firm dx  pt agrees  

Semen analysis  
- Pt already had SA ~4/12 ago while or soon after T therapy  advised to obtain full report from fertility clinic and bring / upload prior to next r/v  
- Discussed value of repeat SA now off T for ~4–5/12  will decide after reviewing prior results at next appt to avoid unnecessary duplication and cost  
- Explained WHO ref ranges and that "borderline" does not equal zero fertility but may ↓monthly chance  pt verbalises understanding

Referrals  
- Plan provisional:  
  - If bloods show clear primary or central hypogonadism → ref to endocrinology and/or fertility specialist for possible gonadotrophin therapy ART etc
