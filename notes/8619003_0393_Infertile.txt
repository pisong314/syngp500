Reason for visit  
F/U general health check in context of infertility POI PCOS  

S  
32F G0P0 primary school teacher  
Known infertility followed by fertility spec @ tertiary clinic dx hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism PCOS evolving POI per letters last seen ~3/12 ago  

Trying to conceive with partner ~3yrs currently on break from active tx after several letrozole OI cycles cancelled poor ovarian response spec has discussed likely donor oocyte in future pt: "I know thats probably our best option just want to be as healthy as I can first"  

Menses long hx oligomenorrhoea now light irregular bleeds every 2–3/12 some vasomotor sx mild night sweats occasional flushes pre bleed nil IMB nil PCB nil pelvic pain nil dyspareunia nil abn PV loss nil galactorrhoea nil headaches nil visual change  

Today agenda  
1 general health check optimise for future fertility tx  
2 bloods incl hormones "to see where things are at"  
Also briefly asked re long term bone health with early ovarian insufficiency plan longer appt once initial bloods back  

Lifestyle  
Non smoker alcohol currently ~2–3 std/wk ↓ from ~5–6/wk nil rec drugs  
Diet generally ok home cooked trying slow wt loss walking more less take away  
Ex walks 30–40min most days Pilates weekly  
Lives with long term male partner supportive both keen to pursue ART donor options as advised  
Work FT primary teacher moderate stress enjoys job  

PMHx  
Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  
PCOS (US + biochem dx via spec)  
Premature ovarian insufficiency probable evolving POI per spec (intermittent amenorrhoea ↑FSH previously)  
Nil known DM HTN thyroid dz hyperprolactinaemia  
Nil surgery  

Meds  
Previously on intermittent letrozole cycles now off  
Combined HRT (transdermal oestradiol patch + cyclical oral progestogen) was recommended by spec for bone CV protection between cycles pt stopped ~2/12 ago as worried would "get in the way of trying naturally"  
Not using contraception infrequent unprotected IC  
Occ vit D + multivit only  

Allergies NKDA  

FHx  
M menopause ~49 nil known POI nil strong FHx CVD breast or ovarian ca  

Psych  
"Mostly ok but up and down about the fertility stuff" sleep 6–7h nil anhedonia nil panic nil SI open to counselling "if you think it would help"  
Partner reportedly also a bit stressed about process but supportive  

O

Abdo soft NT no masses  
Pelvic exam deferred today recent spec exam <6/12 per pt  
Thyroid no goitre no nodules  
Skin mild jawline acne nil signif hirsutism  
Mood affect appropriate  

A  
1 Infertility complex hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism PCOS evolving POI  
   Under fertility spec care likely need donor oocyte/embryo as per spec  
   Today mainly general health optimisation clarify lifestyle HRT impact nil red flag gynae sx  

2 Premature ovarian insufficiency concern re bone + CV health  
   Pt ceased HRT without advice now off ~2/12 underlying hypogonadism + POI → risk osteoporosis CVD  
   Need current hormonal picture and to reinforce HRT for bone/heart separate to ART cycles usually paused/adjusted when actively trying  

3 PCOS with mild metabolic risk  
   BMI overweight range nil known metabolic syndrome but ↑risk insulin resistance dyslipidaemia good opportunity to check metabolic markers lifestyle  

4 Psychosocial stress 2' infertility  
   Mild situational distress coping ok good supports likely to benefit from fertility focused psych  

P  
Ix ordered today to SNP QML  
- FBE UEC LFT  
- Fasting lipids  
- Fasting glucose HbA1c  
- TSH prolactin  
- Repro hormones FSH LH oestradiol AMH (not cycle timed just baseline)  
- 25‑OH vit D  

Consider baseline DEXA if POI confirmed and off HRT >6–12/12 likely still reasonable even at 32 will r/v once results back  

Mx discussed  
Infertility / POI / hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  
- Explained lifestyle factors wt smoking alcohol exercise can influence fertility outcomes  
- Reassured moderate coffee occasional alcohol within NHMRC limits unlikely major driver reducing alcohol still helpful overall  
- Explained in POI spontaneous conception possible but low prob main goals between ART cycles = general health + adequate oestrogen replacement for bone/heart  
- Clarified HRT does not "use up" remaining eggs nor stop future ART recommended re‑starting HRT between tx cycles in coordination with spec  
- Pt keen to restart but wants to check with spec so plan to await hormone results and write to spec for guidance on preferred HRT regimen and timing vs ART  

PCOS / metabolic  
- Brief counselling re gradual wt loss goal ~5–7% over next few mths Mediterranean style diet continue regular ex  
- Current BMI <35 positive for future fertility tx aim maintain or modest ↓  
- Will consider metformin if evidence insulin resistance and if spec agreeable as adjunct  

Bone / CV health in POI  
- Explained ↑lifetime risk low BMD and CVD with untreated POI  
- HRT usually advised until at least avg age menopause unless contraindicated  
- Plan longer 20–30min appt after bloods to go through HRT options DEXA lifestyle etc in more detail  

Psychosocial  
- Normalised emotional response to prolonged infertility offered psych ref fertility womens health focus pt prefers to do stepwise wants bloods + plan first will provide list local providers next r/v or via My Health Record msg  

Tests pending  
All above bloods pending will check results via HealthLink and contact if signif abn  

Safety net  
Pt advised to R/V earlier or attend ED if acute abdo pain heavy PV bleeding fever >38.5C SOB chest pain confusion marked ↓mood or any other concerns  
Standard advice re contraception if decides not to conceive for a period though currently still hoping for spont conception  

Follow up  
- Book long r/v 2–3/52 for results discuss HRT bone health ?DEXA metabolic risk and psych referral  
- F/U 2–3/52 3/12 noted in recalls  

Letter to fertility spec  
- To send via HealthLink  
- Update re pt stopping HRT desire to optimise health prior to next tx  
- Request guidance on preferred HRT regimen between ART cycles and any specific pre‑conception targets eg BMI A1c  

Mgmt plan discussed pt agreed RTC PRN if worse
