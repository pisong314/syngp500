R/V iron def anaemia & IBD if time  

HPC

Nail plate very short curved edges  
Nil spreading erythema onto dorsum  
CRT <2s  
Sensation intact DP/PT pulses palpable  

Abdo  
Soft NT no masses no HSM  

CVS/Resp  
HS dual nil murmur  
Chest clear AE good  

Recent pathology  
Last FBC + iron studies ~7/12 ago  
Hb 100 g/L MCV 74 fL ferritin 8 µg/L iron low transferrin ↑ → iron def pattern  
Pt DNA for repeat bloods 3/12 later as planned  

Assessment  
1 Early ingrown toenail R hallux with mild periungual inflammation  
   Appears localised no abscess no cellulitis nil systemic features  

2 Iron def anaemia likely recurrent / ongoing 2° IBD + menstrual loss + ?poor dietary intake  
   Suboptimal tx due to non adherence to oral iron  
   Symptomatic fatigue + exertional SOB but haemodynamically stable nil red flag cardiac sx  

3 IBD (Crohns) appears clinically quiescent today but adherence to mesalazine patchy  
   Ongoing potential contributor to iron loss and malabsorption  

4 Non adherence to meds & f/u pattern impacting chronic disease care  

Plan  

#1 R great toe early ingrown nail  
Conservative mx  
- Warm salty water soaks 10–15min BD–TDS for ~5–7/7  
- Dry well topical antiseptic (chlorhex or betadine) daily  
- Avoid tight closed shoes as able prefer open toe at home  
- Nail care advice grow nail out cut straight across avoid digging down sides  
Discussed cotton/dental floss wedge under nail once swelling ↓ demo technique pt a bit sceptical but willing to try  

Nil oral abx indicated currently no cellulitis no systemic sx  
Safety net explained  
- Rtn urgently / same day if ↑redness warmth spreading up foot  
- If pus severe pain inability to WB  
- If fevers or feels acutely unwell  
If persistent or recurrent consider partial nail avulsion + phenol separate procedure appt with GP/nurse  

#2 Iron def anaemia  
Discussed likely contributing to fatigue + exertional SOB  
Pt keen to "sort it" but acknowledges difficulty remembering tablets  

Ix ordered today → QML before leaving  
- FBC  
- Iron studies (ferritin serum iron transferrin TSat)  
- CRP (re IBD may affect ferritin)  
- UEC LFT baseline pre any IV iron consideration  

Tx  
- Recommenced ferrous sulfate 325mg OD but advised alternate day dosing acceptable and may ↑tolerance adherence  
- Administration advice  
  Take on empty stomach or with OJ if tolerated can take with food if nausea  
  Avoid tea coffee calcium antacids within ~2h  
  Warned re black stools possible constipation  

Adherence strategies  
- Link dose to routine eg morning but keep 1–2h gap from coffee  
- Use phone alarm keep pack visible but safe from kids (discussed toxicity risk)  

Given long hx non adherence + IBD ?absorption issues  
- Discussed IV iron (Ferinject vs Monofer) as more reliable option if bloods show sig anaemia or poor response  
- Explained benefits quicker repletion few doses small anaphylaxis risk need obs poss transient flu-like sx  
Pt interested but needle phobic will re discuss once results back  

#3 IBD (Crohns)  
Currently mild intermittent loose stools only nil red flags today  
Encouraged regular mesalazine use poor adherence may ↑gut inflammation → iron loss fatigue  
Checked EMR last gastro r/v ~9/12 ago next appt overdue  
Pt "didnt get around to booking"  
Advised to contact her gastro to arrange r/v in next 1–2/12  
Will send brief letter + updated bloods via HealthLink once results available  
Nil med changes today pending bloods time limited  

#4 Behaviour / attendance  
Acknowledged pattern of missed tests + r/v explored briefly  
Barriers work schedule fatigue low perceived urgency  
Agreed concrete steps  
- Have bloods done today before leaving (nurse aware)  
- Book GP f/u at reception before leaving  
Flagged that if ongoing non adherence to oral iron will lean towards IV iron to bypass adherence issue  

Follow up  
F/U 1–2/52  
- R/v FBC iron studies CRP UEC LFT  
- Decide ongoing iron plan oral vs IV  
- Reassess R hallux consider partial nail avulsion if not improving  

Longer appt another time for broader IBD and menstrual/contraception discussion poss strategies to ↓menstrual blood loss  

Safety net  
Advise earlier review / ED if  
- ↑SOB chest pain palps dizziness syncope  
- Fever severe abdo pain bloody diarrhoea rapid ↑bowel sx  
- Worsening toe pain spreading redness systemic sx

Supervisor addendum  
[Time/date]  
Pt discussed with me after consult  

Agree this appears to be early ingrown toenail R hallux with mild periungual inflammation no clear cellulitis or abscess at present  
Conservative mx reasonable no abx indicated currently  

Iron def anaemia likely multifactorial 2° IBD + menses + adherence  
Agree with repeat FBC iron studies CRP UEC LFT via QML today and restart oral iron alternate days while awaiting results  
IV iron appropriate to consider if Hb still ~100 or ↓ or if ongoing adherence issues given IBD background  

IBD seems quiescent clinically today gastro f/u overdue agree with plan to prompt pt to rebook and send summary once bloods back  

Learning points discussed with registrar  
- Use of CRP to help interpret ferritin in IBD  
- When to escalate from oral to IV iron in young pts with chronic disease and adherence problems  
- Thresholds for abx vs procedure in early ingrown toenail  

Plan appropriate  
Will co sign
