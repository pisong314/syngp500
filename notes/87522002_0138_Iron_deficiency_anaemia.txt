CC: cough “won’t go away” + f/up IDA + many other issues (defer → long appt)  

HPC  
Cough ~3/52. Dry / scant clear sputum. Worse nocte + lying flat. No fevers/rigors/NS, no haemoptysis, no pleuritic CP. Mild DOE but long-standing w angina + ?anaemia. No URTI contacts, no recent travel. COVID/flu vax UTD. Never smoker.  
Some GORD sx – retrosternal burning + sour taste esp lying down. Not clearly exertional, no wheeze hx, no asthma/COPD. OTC lozenges, honey tea – minimal benefit. Worried re “stressing the heart”.  

Known IDA ~12/12. On Ferro-grad C but poor adherence (“forget”, constipation). Taking “most days” often w b’fast + tea. Ongoing fatigue, tired by lunch, occasional postural lightheadedness, no syncope. No PV loss (post-meno >20y). No PR bleeding, no melaena (stools dark since iron). Bowel habit stable. No wt loss, abdo pain, dysphagia. Diet low in meat (cost). Prev ferritin 9 µg/L at dx (per records). No prior EGD, colonoscopy >10y ago (screen, reportedly N).  

IHD / angina – long-standing stable. Exertional CP >1 block, settles w rest. No rest pain, no ↑ freq, no nocturnal sx. GTN rarely (~1/month), none re cough. No PND/orthopnoea, 1 pillow.  

Meds (verbal)  
- Aspirin 100 mg mane  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte  
- Bisoprolol 2.5 mg mane  
- GTN spray PRN  
- Ferro-grad C (irregular)  
- Paracetamol PRN  
No NSAIDs. No ACEi. NKDA.  

Ex  
Obs: BP 132/74 HR 76 reg RR 16 SpO₂ 97% RA Temp 36.7  
Gen: well, talking full sentences, intermittent dry cough  
Chest: clear, no focal creps, no wheeze, no signs CCF  
CVS: HS dual, no oedema, JVP not ↑  
Abdo soft NT  
Mild conjunctival pallor  

Impression  
1) Subacute cough 3/52 – likely post-viral/irritative ± GORD component. No red flags. Chest exam + obs reassuring. IHD stable. No HF.  
2) IDA – persistent, likely ↓ intake + suboptimal oral iron (timing/tea, adherence). Needs repeat bloods + consider GI workup given age >70 + FHx bowel ca (not fully discussed – time).  
3) Stable angina/IHD – unchanged pattern. Need to avoid sig anaemia.  
4) Multiple minor issues (skin lesion, toenail, shoulder, sleep, bowel “gurgling”, med/vax review) – not addressed today → book long appt.  

Plan  
Cough  
- Reassured – no evidence pneumonia/CCF today  
- Symptomatic only – fluids, simple linctus PRN nocte (OTC)  
- GORD measures discussed briefly (avoid late meals, elevate head, avoid triggers)  
- If persists >6–8/52 or new red flags → CXR + further w/u  
- Red flags explained: fever, ↑ SOB, haemoptysis, chest pain not typical angina / not settling w GTN, RTC/ED if occurs  

IDA  
- Path ordered today (S&N): FBC, iron studies, B12, folate, U&E, LFT  
- Optimise oral iron: Ferro-grad C 1 tab alternate days, ideally empty stomach + vit C drink, avoid tea/coffee ± Ca 2h either side  
- Warned re black stools, possible constipation – ↑ fibre/fluids, OTC stool softener if needed  
- Emphasised need consistent tx 3–6/12 if tolerated  
- Diet: brief advice re low-cost iron foods (tinned fish, beans, eggs, legumes, occasional red meat).  
- Referral → community dietitian (iron-rich diet on pension budget)  

Further IDA workup  
- Plan: if bloods confirm ongoing IDA → discuss GI scope (colonoscopy ± gastroscopy) and consider gastro referral next visit  

IHD  
- Continue aspirin, atorvastatin, bisoprolol, GTN PRN  
- Usual advice: GTN for exertional CP; if pain >10 min or assoc severe SOB, N/V, diaphoresis → call 000/ED  
- Meds reconciliation + consider cardiology review at longer appt once anaemia clarified  

Other issues  
- Explained time constraints today, prioritised cough + anaemia/heart  
- Pt has written list – asked to bring to long appt  
- To address: skin spot arm, abnormal toenail, shoulder pain, sleep, bowel noise, full med/vax review etc at 30 min appt (may need >1 visit)  

Investigations ordered today  
- FBC  
- Iron studies (ferritin, iron, transferrin sat, TIBC)  
- B12, folate  
- U&E, LFT  
→ QML / S&N (pt to attend today)  
Results review 1–2/52  

Referrals  
- Dietitian (community) – iron-rich diet, low budget  
- Gastro referral pending results  

Follow-up  
- Std appt 1–2/52 – review bloods + cough, discuss GI workup, consider cardiology f/up  
- Long appt 30 min within 2–3/52 for “list”, full med reconciliation, skin/shoulder/sleep review  
- RTC earlier if cough worse, fever, SOB, CP change etc  

Billing: Level B, bulk billed
