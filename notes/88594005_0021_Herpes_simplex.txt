Now multiple very sore crusted areas face neck upper chest some arms trunk  
Pain > itch "stings when I move or touch it"  
Thinks had "cold sore or something" on lip beforehand gets this when run down  
Felt "hot and shivery" a few days ago no documented temp feels tired flat  
No obvious trigger pt wonders re new washing powder aircon@work

Impression / Dx  
1 Eczema herpeticum (widespread HSV infection on background atopic dermatitis) in immunocompromised adult HIV off ART  
   – Acute widespread painful vesicular crusted eruption on eczematous skin systemic malaise HSV hx  
   – High risk complications encephalitis systemic spread bact superinfection  
2 Recurrent HSV likely HSV1 ± multifocal cutaneous involvement  
3 HIV infection likely poorly controlled (off ART unknown VL/CD4) needs urgent re engagement w HIV care  
4 Atopic dermatitis flare underlying will address once acute infection stabilised  

Plan  
Given extent of lesions immunocompromised status not safe for community mgmt  

– Discussed dx in simple terms "herpes infection has spread over your eczema because your immune system is a bit weak need hospital for strong antiviral through a drip"  
Pt asked if cream alone enough advised not appropriate ↑risk serious infection given HIV  

Investigations  
– HSV PCR swab taken from fresh vesicle neck for confirmation sent to QML  
– Bact swab M/C/S from crusted erosion r/o secondary infection  
– Basic bloods to be done in ED (discussed w ED reg)  
  FBC UEC LFT CRP HIV VL + CD4 blood cultures if febrile STI screen incl syphilis GC/CT as per hosp protocol  
Results pending  

Acute mgmt / disposition  
– Phoned regional hospital ED discussed w ED reg accepted for urgent transfer dx suspected eczema herpeticum in HIV+ pt off ART high risk  
– Ambulance transfer arranged due to pain extent rash potential deterioration pt agreeable  
– ED handover rec  
   • Start IV aciclovir dose per wt and renal fn  
   • Analgesia regular paracetamol consider opioid if pain severe  
   • Consider IV fluclox/cefazolin if clinical concern bact superinfection after their r/v  
   • Contact precautions given active HSV lesions and pt works in hospital  

Topical / skin care (mostly for ward)  
– Avoid topical steroids over active herpetic lesions until ID/derm happy  
– Gentle emollients only to uninvolved dry skin  

Counselling / advice  
– Advised avoid close skin to skin contact esp babies pregnant women immunocompromised until cleared  
– Must not attend work until lesions crusted/healed and cleared by occ health  
– Explained washing powder aircon unlikely cause though irritants can flare eczema → ↑risk infections like this  

HIV / chronic disease  
– Need to restart ART once stable to be coordinated by hospital ID team  
– Detailed ART hx sexual health counselling vax status to be done later when not acutely unwell  

Admin  
– Referral letter sent via secure messaging to ED summarising hx exam working dx swabs taken  
– Time spent ~25 mins extended consult incl coordination of transfer phone calls  

Safety net  
– If any sudden worsening en route eg fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion seizure to alert ambulance staff / ED urgently  
– GP F/U 1–2/52 post discharge to r/v hosp summary skin status need ongoing HSV suppression (eg oral aciclovir/valaciclovir) optimise eczema mgmt coordinate ongoing HIV care w regional spec telehealth etc  

Review  
F/U 1–2/52 after hospital discharge or earlier PRN
