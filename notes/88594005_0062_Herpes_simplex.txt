CC: “need more of the herpes tablets”  

Hx  
Known recurrent oral HSV-1  
On/off valaciclovir PRN in past (per EMR multiple small scripts last 18/12, last 3/12 ago)  
Now ↑ flares “every month or two now, used to be hardly ever” but v poor historian, dates all over the place  
Prodrome typical: tingling/burning R upper lip → blisters → crust. Today just “a bit tingly, feels like it’s about to blow up” no vesicles yet  
No fevers, no HA, no confusion, no photophobia, no genital sx “nothing downstairs”  
Hx atopic dermatitis since childhood, mild currently, flares with stress/handwashing  
Background “mild immunodeficiency / autoimmune thing” per old letters, on/off low-dose pred in past. Pt: “I was on some immune tablets ages ago, and steroids when it flares, can’t remember which”  
No current high-dose immunosuppression on med list. Needs longer appt to sort  

Meds (per EMR + pt – unreliable)  
- Valaciclovir 500 mg tabs PRN cold sores – finished  
- Pred 5 mg PRN autoimmune flares – “not for ages”  
- Topical steroid for eczema (unclear which)  
- COCP  
NKDA  

O/E  
Obs WNL (BP 118/72 HR 76 afebrile)  
Looks well, NAD  
Lips: tiny erythematous area R upper vermilion, minimal swell, no clear vesicles yet  
No oral ulcers, no pharyngeal changes  
Skin: mild flexural eczema only, no widespread vesicles, no tender rash, no c/f eczema herpeticum  
Neuro grossly normal  

Dx  
1. Recurrent oral HSV-1 – prodrome today, immunocompromised background (intermittent) + atopy  
2. Atopic dermatitis – mild, stable  
3. Immunocompromised state / ?UCTD – details unclear, not on significant IS currently  

Plan  
HSV  
- Treat early given prodrome + ↑ risk host  
- Valaciclovir 500 mg tabs  
  • 4 tabs (2 g) bd x 1 day at onset of sx (start today when home – already tingling)  
  • Qty for 3 episodes + 1 repeat for episodic use  
- Discussed suppressive option (valaciclovir 500 mg daily 6/12) if truly frequent/severe. Given unreliable hx, for now:  
  • Keep simple diary of episodes (dates / severity / likely triggers) next 3–4/12  
  • Review & consider suppressive Rx if ≥1/mth or worse flares  
- Basic advice re early dosing, avoid contact when lesions active, hand hygiene. Pt works as RN on ward – reminded re avoiding contact with neonates/immunocompromised if lesions active  

Red flags (brief)  
- ED / same-day review if: rapidly spreading painful rash on eczema areas, clusters of vesicles, feels very crook → ?eczema herpeticum  
- Or new severe HA, fever, confusion, neck stiffness, photophobia → ?encephalitis  
- Eye involvement or finger lesions → urgent review  

Eczema  
- Stable. Continue current emollients + usual topical steroid PRN  
- Avoid potent steroid directly over active HSV lesions  
- Full eczema / steroid potency review next long appt – asked to bring all creams  

Immunocompromised / autoimmune hx  
- Needs clarification – too complex for short HSV script visit  
- Plan longer appt to:  
  • Review old haematology/rheum letters in detail  
  • Reconcile past and current IS meds  
  • Consider baseline bloods (FBC, U&E, LFTs, ±HIV, Ig levels) if not done recently  

Meds today  
- Valaciclovir 500 mg tabs as above (PBS)  
- OK to use paracetamol / ibuprofen PRN if pain – no contraindications evident  

F/U  
- Long review 3/12 to:  
  • Reassess HSV frequency/severity & consider daily suppressive valaciclovir  
  • Clarify immunodeficiency / autoimmune dx and IS exposure  
  • Review eczema management / topical steroid potency  
- Earlier if ↑ frequency, poor response to valaciclovir, or any red flags above  

Time  
Std short consult ~10–15 min mainly HSV script + safety-netting; other issues deferred to long review.
