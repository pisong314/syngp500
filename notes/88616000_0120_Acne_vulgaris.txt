24F FU acne + PCOS  

Hx  
Acne since late teens, worse last 2–3y. Face ± upper back. Known PCOS.  
Last review ~8/52 → started BPO 2.5% wash mane + adapalene 0.1% nocte.  
Today: fewer new pimples, mostly flat red/brown marks. Occ small pustule around period. No painful nodules/cysts.  
Main worry = “red marks and little scars” cheeks/jaw, “worried they’re permanent but I don’t really want to get on strong tablets”.  
Adherence: adapalene most nights (~5/7) initially nightly → dryness/peeling first 2/52 → dropped to alt nights. BPO most mornings. Tolerating now.  
No PO acne meds. Has declined abx in past, “don’t really like taking tablets”.  
Thinks choc/coffee at exam time + “cheap chemist sunscreen” may flare. Using heavy fragranced night moisturiser.  
Psych: a bit self‑conscious, avoids photos on bad days, but still uni + work. Denies low mood/SI.  

PCOS  
Dx 19y (oligo‑ov, PCO on US, ↑androgens in past).  
Cycles now ~35–45d (prev 60–90). No OCP (past wt gain + mood “no good” on pill at 19).  
Not sexually active currently. No preg plans next 12/12. No h/o VTE/migraine w aura/smoking. No ↑hirsutism.  

Meds  
Adapalene 0.1% cream nocte (actually ~5/7).  
BPO 2.5% wash mane.  
NKDA.  

Exam  
Well, BMI ~23.  
Face: few closed comedones, few small inflam papules, no nodules/cysts. Multiple erythematous/light‑brown macules post‑inflam. Early shallow atrophic scars bilat cheeks (mild).  
Upper back: few papules + macules. No infxn. No obvious hirsutism/virilisation.  

Impr  
1) Acne vulgaris – mild, improving on topicals. Now mainly post‑inflam erythema/macules + early superficial scarring. PCOS contributory. Pt reluctant systemic Rx.  
2) PCOS – stable, mild cycle irreg, no acute issues.  
3) Mild body image impact – monitor.  

Plan  
Acne  
– Reassured pattern = improving, marks likely fade over months.  
– Adapalene 0.1%: use thin layer to whole affected areas, not spot only. ↑ back to nightly as tolerated (alt nights x1/52 → then nocte).  
– Continue BPO 2.5% wash mane. Avoid over‑washing.  
– Change to non‑comedogenic oil‑free moisturiser + SPF50+ non‑comedogenic sunscreen (stop heavy fragranced products).  
– No picking.  
– Diet: brief chat re high GI/sugary snacks – advised general healthy diet, no extreme restriction.  
– If future persistent scarring once acne quiet → consider derm referral (procedures) but pt happy to “wait and see” for now.  

PCOS / hormones  
– Discussed again COCP (e.g. drospirenone/dienogest) or spironolactone as options for acne + cycles. Pt strongly prefers no tablets today.  
– Plan dedicated PCOS/metabolic review after exams (lipids, fasting glucose/OGTT, BP, wt, contraception options). Longer appt booked 20–30 min.  

Ix  
Nil today – acne mild, PCOS already worked up. Metabolic screen next PCOS review.  

Safety‑net  
RTC earlier if flare with deep painful cystic lesions or mood ↓ / SI → then consider systemic tx ± derm.  
Otherwise FU 8–10/52 acne review.
