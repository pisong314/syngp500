22F review – “diabetes check” + acne

Hx  
Tired x 3–4/12 worse exam periods + after late retail shifts  
↑caffeine (3–5 coffees/d + energy drinks exam time) ↓sleep (<6h)  
Mild ↑thirst but lots of coffee/soft drink. No polyuria, wt loss, recurrent infx  
No PMHx DM, no FHx DM, BMI ~overweight. Diet high takeaway/sugar  
No steroids  

Acne hx years. Face ± upper back. Mixed comedonal/inflam. No nodules/cysts.  
Prev BPO wash + adapalene nocte, poor adherence. Brief COCP trial last yr – self ceased (forgets tabs)  
Irregular use of topicals, missed last f/ups. Flares around menses + with makeup, sometimes sleeps in makeup  
No sig mood sx, just self‑conscious. Periods regular, no hirsutism, no obvious PCOS features volunteered  
Sexually active with male partner, condoms inconsistently, doesn’t want pill/implant/IUD

Meds: nil regular  
Allergies: NKDA  

O/E  
BP 112/70 HR 78 afebrile RR 14 SpO₂ 99% RA  
Wt 72kg Ht 165cm → BMI 26.4 (OW)  
Skin: face + upper back – multiple open/closed comedones, scattered erythematous papules/pustules, no nodules/cysts, mild PIH, no sig scarring  
Rest exam unremarkable

Impression  
1) Tiredness – low suspicion DM, likely multifactorial (↓sleep, ↑caffeine, diet, stress) but BMI 26 + poor diet → reasonable screen  
2) Acne vulgaris – mild–mod mixed, chronic, poor adherence to topicals. No red flags, no clear PCOS  
3) Contraception suboptimal if future systemic acne meds considered  

Plan  
1) R/o metabolic / other causes tiredness  
– Path ordered: fasting BSL, HbA1c, FLP, U&E, LFT, FBC, TSH  
– Brief discussion re lifestyle contrib (diet, sleep, caffeine). If Ix N, focus lifestyle next review  
– Review results 1–2/52 (pt prefers late arvo). Recall set.  

2) Acne  
– Simplify regimen: restart combo BPO 2.5% + adapalene 0.1% gel nocte (whole face)  
  • Start alt nights x1/52 → then nightly as tol  
  • Adv re irritation, use non‑comedogenic moisturiser, ↓freq if too irritable  
– Gen measures noted: gentle cleanser, oil‑free makeup, remove before bed, SPF 30+ non‑comedogenic  
– Diet: brief advice re possible triggers (high GI, dairy) – trial ↓ only if pt motivated  
– Systemic options discussed for future if poor response despite adherence (anti‑androgen COCP, spironolactone, PO abx, derm ref incl possible isotretinoin) – pt currently not keen on daily tabs / LARC  
– Contraception: advised consistent condom use; would need reliable contraception before systemic anti‑androgens/isotretinoin  

3) F/up  
– Booked ~6/52 acne review (check response/tolerance, re‑visit systemic options if needed)  
– Earlier review if worsening, nodules/cysts, scarring, or mood impact  
– Pt mentioned intermittent stress/low mood when acne bad – no red flags today, advised longer appt if mood worsens/wants to discuss  

RTC sooner if sx ↑, new sx (polyuria, wt loss, mood deterioration etc)

[Added 16:30 by Dr Kaur – results]  
Path from this morning not yet available – likely collected pm, will check tomorrow. HbA1c/TSH pending.  
Plan unchanged. Will call/SMS if any abnormals, otherwise discuss at booked f/up.
