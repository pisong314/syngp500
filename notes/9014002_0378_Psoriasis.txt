1 Diarrhoea  
Expl natural hx most viral/bact gastro settles 7–10/7 without abx discussed risks unnecessary abx eg C diff resistance side effects  
Ix  
- Re issue stool MCS + PCR faecal pathogen panel form encourage sample next 24–48h if sx persist  
- If sx >2/52 or dev red flags (fever >38.5 PR bleed mucus severe abdo pain wt loss nocturnal diarrhoea) → earlier r/v consider FBE U&E CRP coeliac serology colonoscopy ref  
Mx  
- ORS eg Gastrolyte/Hydralyte  
- Simple diet avoid high fat very spicy caffeine excess EtOH while unwell  
- Loperamide 2mg PRN up to 8mg/d short term ok as nil blood nil fever advise cease if worse or blood/mucus  
Pt again requested abx documented discussed no indication today agreed to reconsider if stool +ve treatable bacterial or if becomes systemically unwell  

2 Psoriasis flare mild–mod  
Education re chronic nature common triggers stress obesity EtOH some meds infections importance regular emollients correct topical use rotation  
Explained biologics reserved for mod–severe disease PBS criteria need derm review not 1st line for current limited BSA  

Topical regimen (per eTG)  

Scalp  
- Start mometasone furoate 0.1% lotion OD to affected scalp up to 4/52 then taper alt days then BIW maint as able  
- Add coal tar shampoo OTC once plaques improving daily until clear then ~2x/wk  

Elbows/knees  
- LPC 4% + salicylic acid 3% cream BD 4/52  
- For flare control methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% oint OD to plaques up to 4/52 then ↓freq aim cease continue tar as maint  

Counsel re risk skin atrophy striae tachyphylaxis with prolonged potent steroid thin layer plaques only avoid face/flexures  

Nails/joints  
Mild nail pitting only advised monitor for persisting joint swell AM stiffness >30min dactylitis heel pain inflammatory back pain RTC if occurs  

Ref / f/u  
Derm ref discussed pt keen "go straight to injections" plan trial optimised topicals first  
If inadequate control after ~8–12/52 or sig impact on function/psych wellbeing persists will ref derm for ?phototherapy / systemic options pt wants clear timeframe documented  

3 Obesity / CV risk  
Brief only today explained wt loss can ↓psoriasis severity ↓CV risk  
Plan long appt 20–30min in 2–4/52 for  
- Full metabolic r/v BP trend lipids HbA1c fasting BSL LFT U&E etc  
- Diet physical activity wt management options ?dietitian ref  
Regular NSAID use may exacerbate psoriasis advised limit prefer paracetamol for MSK pain pending fuller assessment  

4 Alcohol  
Advised aim ≤10 std drinks/wk ≤4/occasion highlighted EtOH as trigger psoriasis contributor to wt mood
