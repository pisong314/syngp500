Gen well appearring NAD mildly anxious keeps referring to list  

Abdo  
Soft NT throughout nil guarding/rebound nil masses nil organomegaly  
Bowel sounds normal  
Nil CVA tenderness  

Perianal exam (chaperone offered + accepted L lat)

Lichenification + excoriations few superficial linear fissures  
Nil weeping ulcer blister or purulent d/c  
Small soft skin tag 6 oclock NT  
Nil obvious ext haemorrhoids thrombosis warts abscess fistula openings  
DRE deferred today discussed will R/V if sx change eg bleed pain change habit  

Skin elsewhere not examined due time  

# Ix  
Nil ordered today appears low risk currently  
Plan if abdo sx persist → consider FBC UEC LFT CRP coeliac serology ± H pylori breath/stool via SNP later  

# Impression  

1 Generalised mild abdo discomfort  
Likely functional / diet related dyspepsia / bloating  
Poss contrib high fat takeaway energy drinks intermittent NSAID use  
No red flags on hx/exam  
Serious pathology (acute abdo obstruction PUD complication biliary dz IBD malignancy) appears unlikely atm though will monitor  

2 Pruritus ani SNOMED 90446007  
Chronic 3–4/12 w lichenification from scratching  
Likely multifactorial irritant dermatitis 2° over wiping wet wipes sweat/moisture synthetic underwear hot work env + possible stress component  
Nil features today of candidal or bacterial infection nil tinea pattern so held off swabs for now  
No other dermatoses evident today  

3 Consult management  
"Shopping list" style mult issues in short appt time  
Reinforced need for long appt for chronic shoulder mole fatigue sleep toes etc  

# Plan  

1) Abdo pain  
Likely benign at this stage  
Advice  
– Trial ↓ greasy takeaway + energy drinks for 1–2/52 smaller meals good hydration avoid large late meals  
– Limit ibuprofen use prefer paracetamol for shoulder until R/V  

Meds  
– Suggested ongoing PRN alginate/antacid eg Gaviscon OTC  
No new script required  

Safety net  
– ED/urgent review if severe or localised pain persistent vomiting haematemesis PR bleed melaena fevers jaundice unable to pass wind/stool or sig wt loss  
– If sx persist >2–3/52 or any change in bowel habit will R/V and arrange bloods as above ± H pylori and further w/up  

2) Anal pruritus  
General care discussed written info given  
– Gentle cleaning warm water only avoid soaps wipes antiseptics  
– Pat dry or cool hairdryer  
– Soap substitute eg sorbolene cream for showering  
– Barrier: greasy emollient eg white soft paraffin thinly after cleaning and post BMs  
– Switch to loose cotton underwear change out of sweaty work gear after shift if poss  
– Avoid scratching keep nails short consider cotton gloves at night cool compresses  

Topical steroid  
– Start methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% fatty oint (Advantan) apply thinly perianal once nocte for 2–3/52 up to max 4/52 then cease  
– May use short courses PRN if recurs  
Discussed risks of prolonged use skin thinning etc  

No swabs today as nil weeping/ulceration  

F/U  
– R/V 3–4/52 to assess itch response re examine  
– If poor response → check adherence irritant avoidance consider swabs (bact/fungal) ± scrapings if tinea suspected reconsider dx eg psoriasis lichen sclerosus other anal pathology and poss derm or colorectal ref  

3) Other issues  
– Pt to book long appt 20–30min next 1–2/52 to address chronic shoulder pain suspicious mole fatigue sleep and ?tinea pedis  
Asked to prioritise list  

RTC earlier if sx worsen or new red flags  

-----------------------------  
Supervisor addendum Dr ___ 22/11/25  

Discussed case w reg after consult  
Agree abdo pain most likely functional / diet related in context of greasy food energy drinks NSAID use low suspicion of serious pathology at present no Ix required today safety net appropriate  

Pruritus ani picture fits irritant dermatitis w lichenification nil red flag anorectal features on exam reasonable to trial short course Advantan fatty oint + barrier and hygiene measures  
Would consider DRE and poss further anorectal w/up if not settling next R/V or if bleeding pain or change bowel habit develops earlier  

Learning points discussed  
– Importance of early agenda setting esp w new pt w long list  
– When to proceed to DRE and when ok to defer with safety net
