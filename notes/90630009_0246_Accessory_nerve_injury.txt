22/11/25 Tel consult – bulk billed (MBS 91891)

42M electrician, known pt  

CC: “bad pain in my shoulder and down the arm, can’t sleep”

HPC  
L shoulder/upper arm pain “shocking”, deep ache + sharp stabs if moves “wrong way”  
Onset unclear – says 1–2/52 then “ages, at least a month” → timeline unreliable  
Pain mainly over top of L shoulder → mid upper arm, not past elbow  
No neck pain  
Severity ~7–8/10 noc, 5/10 day, waking from sleep  
↑ with lying on L side, abduction, overhead work, lifting tools  
Heat pack helps a bit, Panadol “does nothing”  
Tried old ibuprofen “couple of times” unsure dose  
+ numb “dead patch” over L upper outer shoulder a few days after pain started  
+ subjective weakness – struggling to lift ladder, compensating with R side  
- shooting pain down arm, - tingling fingers, - hand weakness, - neck stiffness  
No trauma recalled – ?slept “funny on lounge” + new heavier cordless drill at work  

PMHx: no known chronic dz in file, no prev shoulder/neck issues recorded  
Meds: no regulars. Occasional OTC “little white or blue pill” for pain  
Allergies: NKDA (per pt, none recorded)  
SHx: electrician, manual/overhead work, needs to keep working  

Red flags screen:  
- CP/SOB/jaw pain/diaphoresis  
- fever/weight loss/night sweats  
- recent neck injury, limb heaviness/clumsiness, gait change, sphincter disturbance  

O/E (phone only)  
No obs (telehealth)  
Voice comfortable at rest, occasional pauses/winces when describing movement  
Speech/cognition ok but vague re dates, contradictory re duration  
No audible SOB/cough  

Impression  
Acute severe L shoulder + upper arm pain + focal numb patch + subjective weakness  
→ ?focal neuropathy  
DDx:  
- ?spinal accessory nerve injury (CN XI) – needs F2F exam (trapezius, scapula)  
- ?neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage–Turner)  
- ?C-spine radiculopathy less likely (no neck pain, no distal neuro sx)  
- ?rotator cuff / impingement but doesn’t explain discrete numb area  

Plan – today (telehealth)  
Analgesia / anti-inflam:  
- Prednisolone 50 mg PO mane x5/7 with food (short course for severe neuropathic shoulder pain) – avoid NSAIDs while on pred, warned re mood/insomnia/dyspepsia  
- Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN (max 4 g/day)  

Activity  
- Adv avoid heavy lifting/overhead work L arm until reviewed  
- Sleep on back or R side, pillow under L arm, avoid lying on L  

Safety net  
- ED if sudden ↑ weakness, spreading numbness, new neck pain, gait change, bowel/bladder issues, CP or SOB. Pt verbalised understanding  

F/U / further workup  
- F2F appt booked next available AM within 24–48 hrs for full shoulder + neuro exam  
  • CN XI – shoulder shrug, trapezius power, scapular position/winging, ROM  
  • UL neuro – power, reflexes, sensation  
  • C-spine exam  
- Likely Ix after exam:  
  • MRI C-spine ± brachial plexus vs targeted imaging of accessory nerve/shoulder  
  • Baseline bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, BSL) if further steroids needed  

Referrals (pending exam)  
- Physio likely mainstay (shoulder girdle stabilisation, ROM) – discuss EPC/CDM if prolonged  
- Consider neuro/peripheral nerve specialist if confirmed CN XI injury and poor recovery / abnormal imaging  

Work  
- Notes difficulty with overhead work. Will assess for cert/restricted duties (no heavy/overhead L arm) at F2F – not issued today  

Other  
- Briefly mentioned chronic back ache “probably ute seats” – defer to separate review if ongoing  

RTC F2F 24–48 hrs or earlier if deteriorates. History reliability limited – will update after exam.
