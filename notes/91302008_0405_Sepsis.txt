Reason for visit  
F/u after recent hosp admission Wagga Base for CAP with sepsis  
C/O ongoing sneezing blocked nose  

HPI  
72F Anglo-Australian retired admin  lives alone  daughter 40 mins away visits q few days  
Seen for post sepsis r/v  d/c 2/7 ago on oral abx  

Pt very focussed on URTI sx  
3–4/7 sneezing nasal blockage clear rhinorrhoea mild frontal pressure  
"this damn cold" "nose blocked so I cant sleep"  
Nil anosmia nil purulent nasal d/c nil facial swelling nil dental pain  
Feels abit washed out attributes to poor sleep rather than systemic illness  

Regarding recent sepsis  
Had fevers confusion in hosp per d/c summary  pt disputes dx  
"Youre wrong I know my body" "just a bad flu and dehydration"  
"Thats not what the internet says about sepsis"  highly sceptical of medical info  challenges most suggestions  

Currently afebrile by home readings  
Resp sx improving  cough minimal non productive  nil SOB @ rest nil pleuritic CP  
Nil dizziness nil ↓UO nil confusion appetite reasonable though "everything tastes off from those antibiotics"  

Meds  
Amoxycillin clavulanate 875/125 bd day 3/7  
Considering self stopping "ruining my gut" "internet says antibiotics wreck your immune system"  
Strong adherence concerns  

Allergies  
Nil known  

PMHx  
Recent CAP with sepsis 5/7 admission Wagga Base  
Otherwise nil sig PMHx recorded  nil reg meds pre admission  
Non smoker  ETOH 1–2 glasses wine/wk  

Other concerns  
Briefly raised "my aching knees from all those hospital drugs"  time limited advised separate appt  

Tangential beliefs  
? irritant from new scented laundry powder "theyve poisoned the air in the house"  
Concern re town water "smells like chemicals" ? weakened immune system pre sepsis  
Explained unlikely primary aetiology of sepsis though irritant role in rhinitis possible  

Systems screen post sepsis  
Consciousness clear  nil confusion  
Breathing  nil SOB  speaking full sentences  
BP sx  nil presyncope nil new severe headache  
GU  passing normal volumes nil dysuria  
Skin  nil rash nil mottling nil new wounds  

Exam  
Gen  Elderly woman alert mildly irritable animated  occas raised voice  sitting comfortably  
Obs  BP 104/68  HR 96 reg  RR 18  Temp 36.8  SpO₂ 96% RA  BMI ~26  
ENT  Nasal mucosa mildly erythematous oedematous  clear rhinorrhoea  nil sinus tenderness

Resp  Normal WOB  mild bibasal crackles R>L  no focal bronchial breathing no wheeze good AE bilat  
CVS  HS dual nil murmur periph pulses palpable periph warm  
Abdo soft NT  
Neuro AOx3 gait normal  

Behavioural  
Pt argumentative frequently interrupting  "they nearly killed me in that hospital"  
Despite hostility able to process info and repeat back key points  capacity intact  

Recent results (per hosp d/c 20/11)  
BCx x2 nil growth  
WCC 18 → 10.2 on d/c  
Creat 83  
CRP downtrending exact value not provided  
Nil new pathology today  discussed  pt initially demanded "full bloods to prove Im fine"  declined as not clinically indicated given stable obs exam  plan targeted tests only if red flags  

Assessment  
1  Recent CAP with sepsis  improving  
   Presentation and course consistent with sepsis life threatening organ dysfunction 2° pneumonia as per national sepsis guidelines  
   Currently haemodynamically stable afebrile mentation normal adequate urine output nil red flags for ongoing sepsis or septic shock  

2  Acute rhinitis URTI vs allergic/irritant rhinitis  
   Short hx sneezing nasal obstruction clear discharge mild frontal discomfort  
   Nil features bacterial sinusitis  nil lower resp deterioration  likely viral or irritant post infective state following recent admission  consider contribution from scented products  

3  Difficult therapeutic relationship  high reliance on internet sources  strongly challenges medical framing of sepsis and abx use  ↑ risk of non adherence esp abx  

Plan  

1  Post sepsis / pneumonia f/u  
   Re-explained sepsis pathophysiology  dysregulated host response → organ dysfunction  linked to her documented hypotension fever confusion in hosp  emphasised that early IV abx and fluids likely prevented progression to shock  acknowledged poor experience and sense of not being heard  
   Strongly advised complete 7/7 course amox/clav as per CAP guidelines  discussed relapse and resistance risk if stopped early  
   Pt "Ill think about it"  adherence ?  documented concern  

   Safety net  
   ED/000 if fever or rigors new or ↑ SOB rapid breathing CP dizziness or syncope ↓UO confusion mottled or cold peripheries  
   Provided written instructions in AVS  

   Offered repeat bloods FBC U&E CRP in 5–7/7 primarily for reassurance and to confirm biochemical recovery  pt "pointless but if it shuts you up Ill do it"  
   Path form given for next wk on site collection  

   Plan GP r/v 1/52 to reassess clinically and review bloods  

2  Sneezing / nasal congestion  
   Explained picture most consistent with viral or allergic/irritant rhinitis  abx not indicated as per current URTI guidelines  pt compared to neighbour who "got antibiotics for a cold"  reiterated lack of benefit here  

   Symptomatic mgmt  
   - Saline nasal spray prn  
   - Intranasal corticosteroid  fluticasone 50 mcg 2 sprays each nostril mane 7/7 then ↓ to 1 spray mane each nostril for further wk if benefit  PBS script provided  
   - Paracetamol up to 1 g qid PRN for facial pressure  

   Advised trial avoidance of strongly scented products  suggest change to low fragrance laundry powder as practical test while clarifying this did not cause sepsis  

   Red flags for acute bacterial sinusitis discussed  unilateral worsening facial pain purulent nasal d/c fever  R/V if occur  

3  Psychosocial / communication  
   Validated feelings re hosp stay and "not being listened to"  
   Used direct concrete language minimal jargon  summarised shared goals  avoid unnecessary meds maintain independence at home  
   Note for future consults  expect ongoing challenge to medical advice  need clear safety netting and explicit discussion of risks vs benefits  may benefit from longer appt if complex issues raised eg knees  MHCP not indicated currently  mood not clearly low though trust issues prominent  

Follow up  
GP r/v 1/52 or earlier if deterioration  
ED as above if sepsis red flags  
Separate appt for knee pain and preventative care when acute issues settled
