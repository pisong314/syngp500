Ix  
Hospital results viewed My Health Record  
BC: H influenzae likely type b per ID repeat BC post abx NG  
FBC WCC 15→9.2 mild normocytic anaemia stable  
CRP ↓ trend  
CXR nil pneumonia  
Nil new tests today clinically improving afebrile haemodynamically stable  
?FBC CRP via Sullivan Nicolaides if any clinical deterioration  

Imp  
1 Hib epiglottitis + H influenzae bacteraemia day 4 post presentation now stable on step down PO abx nil current red flags high risk age recent invasive infection needs close obs  
2 Post sepsis fatigue expected early recovery phase  
3 HTN HLD stable meds unchanged full CVD r/v deferred pt time poor  

Plan⇒  
# Epiglottitis / bacteraemia  
Cont cefuroxime 500mg BD PO to complete 10 days total course emphasised must finish even if feels well  
Cont paracetamol PRN max 4g/24h avoid NSAIDs given age + irbesartan  
Safety net  
– 000 / ED if any SOB noisy breathing stridor “throat closing”  
– ED if unable swallow saliva new drooling high fevers rigors confusion chest pain feels “crook again real bad”  
– Same day GP if ↑ throat pain new neck stiffness or persistent fevers but still stable  

ENT + ID OP r/v already booked via hospital reminded attend  
Nil further dex indicated symptoms improving nil airway compromise  

# Post sepsis fatigue  
Explained common post bacteraemia expect gradual ↑ energy over 1–2/52 pacing fluids small meals  
Offered FBC CRP in ~1/52 via QML but pt prefers avoid extra trips agree to do only if not clearly improving or if new sx  

# Chronic disease / diet  
HTN HLD cont current meds BP ok today  
Diet and rising food costs briefly discussed ?dietitian ref will send internal ref dietetics to call pt to arrange later  

Tests ordered today  
Nil new pathology or imaging  

F/U  
GP r/v 3–4/7 throat airway temp general recovery prefer in person if daughter can bring  
RTC earlier or ED as per red flags above  

Time  
Brief focused consult ~15min clinic a bit busy note short
