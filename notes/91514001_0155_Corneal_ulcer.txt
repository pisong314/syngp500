Family / carer input  
Daughter feels eye “much beter than few days ago” confirms she is managing drops schedule at home and pt tends to just say “yes” even if unsure so asks for written instructions  

Assessment  
1 Corneal ulcer L contact‑lens associated improving on current ophthal‑directed tx  
   - Clinical picture consistent with healing small central‑paracentral ulcer  
   - VA L 6/12→6/9‑ with pinhole mild residual redness discomfort no systemic sx  
   - Nil red flag features today (nil ↑ pain nil ↓ vision vs prior nil hypopyon nil severe HA N/V)  
   - RFs present overnight CL wear suboptimal hygiene showering in lenses  

   DDx considered  
   - Bacterial keratitis 2° CL wear (primary dx)  
   - Herpetic keratitis less likely given Hx ED/ophthal dx response to broad‑spec abx and no dendritic pattern seen previously per daughter  
   - Marginal keratitis / sterile infiltrate less likely as had signif pain photophobia and ED concern for ulcer  

2 General health check  
   Opportunistic screen only today time + language constraints  
   Vitals BMI in healthy range nil immediate concerns from brief ROS  
   Needs dedicated longer consult with professional interpreter for CST contraception immunisation review metabolic screen mental health etc  

Plan  

# Corneal ulcer L / eye care  
- Continue ofloxacin 0.3% eye drops L q4h while awake for remaining 5/7 as per ophthal then tds as instructed  
- Strict advice nil CL wear either eye until formally cleared by ophthal pt queried “maybe just for work” reiterated NO lenses at all until eye specialist says safe daughter translated  
- Discard current CL pair and case advised not to reuse  
- Future CL hygiene discussed  
  wash/dry hands before handling use fresh solution each time nil overnight wear unless specifically prescribed nil showering or swimming with lenses in  
- Safety net / red flags (provided printed sheet simple English for daughter to go through @home)  
  - Attend ED or contact ophthal urgently if  
    ↑ eye pain or redness  
    sudden ↓ vision or “black curtain” / dark patch  
    new pus like discharge or eyelid swelling  
    severe HA or N/V with eye pain  
- Confirmed ophthal f/u appt in 3/7 encouraged to attend even if feels beter  
- Will request ophthal correspondence via secure messaging consent obtained from pt/daughter  

# General health / prevention (limited today)  
- Reassured re current BP BMI lifestyle generally ok brief advice maintain balanced diet some regular exercise as able with shift work  
- Needs longer 30 min health check with professional interpreter (TIS) for  
  - Cervical screening test (last CST unknown >5/12? daughter unsure)  
  - Contraception and broader women’s health  
  - Routine preventative screening bloods FBE U&E LFT lipids fasting BSL or HbA1c Vit D immunisation check mental health screen etc  
- Reception to book 30 min “health check + interpreter” appt in next 4–6/52 daughter agreed  

Communication / CALD  
- Noted pt tendency to nod say “yes” despite limited understanding used teach‑back via daughter asked pt to repeat key points in own words  
- Offered phone interpreter today daughter preferred to interpret this visit agreed to professional interpreter for longer future consults  

Ix today  
Nil new tests for eye given active ophthal care  
Routine bloods deferred to extended visit when explanations can be clearly understood  

F/U  
- Ophthal clinic in 3/7 as arranged  
- GP r/v 1/52 to reassess eye progress earlier PRN if any red flags  
- Separate 30 min GP appt with interpreter for full health check + women’s health within 4–6/52
