F/U re R shoulder pain weakness ?RC tear 3–4/12 insidious  
Today says shoulder "just a bit weak and a bit sore nothing to fuss about" daughter concerned re hanging washing lifting kettle  
Pain dull ache lat R shoulder upper arm ↑ reaching OH or out to side eg dishes washing night pain esp lying R side wakes a few times/7 nil trauma fall heavy lifting ?overreach into cupboard + slept in recliner  
Feels arm "more weak than painful" ↓power lifting jug shopping struggles > shoulder height uses L hand to assist  
Impact ADLs dressing bra jumper hair washing hanging washing slower avoids OH tasks still indep  
Hx L MCA ischaemic CVA 2018 good recovery mild R hand clumsiness nil new neuro sx speech OK nil facial droop nil leg wk  
Meds per chart aspirin 100 od atorvastatin 40 nocte perindopril 5 od PRN paracetamol 500 rarely  
Allergies NKDA  
Red flags nil neck pain nil radicular sx nil paraesthesia nil wt loss nil fevers nil night sweats nil cancer hx  
Lives alone unit daughter nearby helps shopping still drives short distances prefers avoid hosp surgery "too many pills"

P  
# R shoulder RC tear  
- Imaging R shoulder USS ordered via SNP to assess RC integrity tear size retraction bursitis etc results pend  
- If USS shows full thickness large tear with ongoing functional impact consider MRI + ortho opinion  
- Analgesia encourage simple analgesia rather than "toughing it out" paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h) avoid reg NSAIDs given age CVA hx ACEi  
- Act mod avoid painful OH lifting repetitive reach bring items to waist level suggested lower line or assist from daughter short term  
- Sleep trial L side with pillow supporting R arm or supine pillow under R elbow  
- Physio ref local shoulder physio focus RC scap stabiliser strengthening ROM pain limited progressive loading + HEP mindful of cost keep visits minimal  

Discussed subacromial CSI option if pain still sig esp sleep or limiting physio after ~6–8/52 pt prefers try ex first open to inj later  

# Stroke 2° prevention  
- Meds unchanged adherent  
- Lipids UEC FBC to be rechecked next chronic dz appt form for QML to be done prior to that  
- Needs longer CVA risk factor r/v book long appt GP + nurse 4–6/52 for CDM plan  

Safety net  
- Red flags explained sudden severe shoulder pain post fall inability move arm or any new neuro sx FAST → ED  
- RTC earlier if pain or wk worsens markedly or physio ex cause persisting ↑pain  

F/U  
- R/V 2–3/52 std appt with USS + physio report  
- Long CDM appt 4–6/52 for stroke HTN lipids review
