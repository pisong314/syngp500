Reason for visit  
C/O back pain  

Identifying details  
72M retired construction worker Anglo-Australian known to clinic h/o T2DM HTN HLD prev ischaemic CVA  

HPC  
Low thoracic upper lumbar ache x ~3/52 worse end of day prolonged standing  
Nil trauma nil radiation to legs nil paraesthesia nil weakness nil saddle anaesthesia nil bowel or bladder sx  
Using Panadol intermittently partial relief  

Pt very fixed on mechanical cause from new mattress and chairs  
"youre wrong I know my body its my back"  
Gets argumentative esp when shoulder mentioned  

On further questioning ongoing R shoulder pain x ~3–4/12 insidious  
Pain anterolateral shoulder → lateral upper arm worse overhead activity reaching into cupboards lying R side wakes him  
Difficult lifting kettle R arm  
Seen ED ~2/12 ago after minor lift told "might have torn something" shoulder US arranged but not done  
Very worried re internet info says tears dont heal need surgery straight away  
Nil neck pain nil distal paraesthesia  

PMHx  
- Ischaemic CVA ~5yrs ago mild residual L sided weakness independent ADLs on sec prev  
- T2DM ~15yrs control variable  
- HTN  
- Hyperlipidaemia  
- Nil known IHD  
- Nil spinal surgery

Gliclazide MR 60mg mane  
Atorvastatin 40mg nocte  
Perindopril 5mg mane  
Aspirin 100mg mane  
Paracetamol 1g PRN up to TDS  
No regular NSAID "they wreck your kidneys"  

Allergies

Social  
Lives with wife daughter nearby  
Retired builder heavy manual work hx a lot of overhead work  
Ex smoker ~40 pack yrs quit post stroke  
Alcohol ~6–8 std drinks/wk  
Still driving locally on aged pension  

Behaviour  
Consult challenging frequent interruptions raised voice at times  
Prefers direct plain language settles when concerns acknowledged  
Time limited as repeatedly redirected to back vs shoulder discussion  

Systems (focused)  
Constitutional nil fevers nil NS nil wt loss  
Neuro nil new focal sx nil change in stroke deficit nil speech or visual sx  
GU nil urinary retention or incontinence  

Obs  
BP 136/78 HR 78 reg RR 16 SpO2 98% RA afebrile  
BMI ~30kg/m2  

Exam  
General alert mobilising independently appears frustrated but NAD  

Back  
Mild kyphotic degenerative posture  
Mild paraspinal tenderness T12–L2 nil focal bony tenderness  
Lumbar ROM mild ↓ flex/ext  
LL neuro NAD power 5/5 reflexes 2+ plantars down SLR neg gait stable  

R shoulder  
Initially reluctant "Im here for my back not for you to poke my shoulder"  
No gross deformity slight ↓ supraspinatus bulk vs L  
Tender anterolateral shoulder just distal to acromion ACJ non tender  
Passive ROM near full but painful 80–120° abd and FF  
Active abd limited ~90° due pain ± weakness  
Painful arc present  
Jobe: pain + mild weakness  
ER against resistance painful slight weakness  
IR (lift off) near normal but uncomfortable  
Neck exam unremarkable Spurling neg  

CVS/Resp HS dual nil added sounds chest clear  

Diabetic foot check deferred r/v another day  

Impression / dx  
1 Mechanical thoracolumbar back pain likely muscular degenerative nil red flags  
2 R shoulder rotator cuff pathology ?supraspinatus tendinopathy vs partial tear less likely full thickness but possible given weakness and nocturnal pain  
3 T2DM and prior CVA stable by hx todays consult focused MSK  

Differentials R shoulder  
- RC tendinopathy vs partial tear  
- GH OA or ACJ OA less likely ROM preserved ACJ non tender  
- Referred cervical pain less likely neck exam NAD  

Ix  
Discussed imaging pt initially dismissive "whats the point of scans youll just tell me to exercise" eventually agreed  

Ordered today  
- R shoulder US to assess RC tear bursitis  
- HbA1c UEC LFT lipids urine ACR for overdue DM review  
Nil spinal imaging indicated at this stage red flags explained pt unhappy wants MRI "thats not what the internet says" rationale conservative approach discussed  

(Prev results for ref last HbA1c 7.9% approx 9/2024 was 7.4% 03/2023 creat 92 eGFR >60 at last UEC – trend to be rechecked)  

Plan  

# Mechanical back pain  
Reassured nil features of serious spinal pathology  
Likely muscular strain degenerative change  
Analgesia  
- Continue paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
- Offered short course NSAID eg naproxen 250–500mg BD 5–7/7 with food cautioned re kidneys BP pt declined  
Non pharm  
- Encourage gentle mobility avoid prolonged bed rest  
- Heat pack to lumbar area  
Basic lumbar core ex discussed PN to give handout when in for bloods if time  

Red flags discussed new leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia bowel bladder change fevers wt loss to seek urgent care  

# R shoulder ?RC tear  
Explained likely RC issue related to age long term overhead work tendon overload  
Emphasised many tears respond to physio activity modification surgery not always required  
Pt sceptical "if it doesnt get beter Ill be asking for a proper surgeon not just exercises"  

Activity  
- Avoid heavy lifting overhead work  
- Keep shoulder moving within pain limits to avoid stiffness  

Analgesia  
- Panadol as above for shoulder as well  
- Discussed option topical NSAID gel may be more acceptable given renal concerns consider Voltaren gel  

Referrals  
- Physio recommended for RC rehab scapular control posture pt feels "physio just rubs it and sends you home" agreed to consider if US confirms tear draft ref in system to finalise once US back  
- Consider subacromial steroid inj if persisting significant pain >6/52 despite conservative mx and depending on US findings counselled may ↑ BSLs transiently  

Surgical ref  
Explained usually reserved for acute complete tears w marked weakness or failure of conservative mx over months will reconsider post imaging physio trial if poor progress  

# Stroke T2DM brief  
Nil new neuro sx  
Reinforced importance ongoing sec prevention aspirin statin BP control  
Explained DM ↑ risk of tendon issues slower healing good glycaemic control may help sx  
Full DM review inc meds BGLs foot check vaccs deferred due time asked to book longer appt 4–6/52  

Safety net  
Advised to seek urgent care ED for  
- sudden severe back pain w leg weakness numbness saddle anaesthesia bowel bladder disturbance  
- new neuro sx suggestive recurrent stroke eg facial droop slurred speech limb weakness  
- fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion  
RTC if pain ↑ or not settling  

Admin / billing  
Onsite pathology forms given for bloods today  
Shoulder US referral printed and uploaded to system  
Bulk billed today  
AIR not updated (no vacc given)  

Follow up  
- Std f/u 1–2/52 to r/v shoulder US + bloods finalise physio ref discuss possible steroid inj and structured back pain plan  
- Separate long appt 20–30min in 4–6/52 for comprehensive DM CVD risk review incl foot check vaccs med review  

Pt left still somewhat dissatisfied re lack immediate MRI but accepted plan for shoulder US conservative back mx verbalised understanding of red flags though remains wary of "too much mucking around"
