F/U jaw pain / ↓mouth opening  

72F, known OA. Seen 2/52 ago here re ?TMJ.  

S:  
- Jaw pain 3–4/52, L>R pre‑auricular  
- Dull ache, sharp twinge on wide opening/chew  
- Now 3–4/10 rest, up to 6/10 chew (was 8/10)  
- No trauma, no dental work, ?nocturnal bruxism (husband reports)  
- No HA, visual sx, scalp T, jaw claudication, fevers, wt loss, PMR sx  
- No ear pain, neuro sx, dental pain  

PMHx: OA hands/knees/spine. No RA/DM. NKDA.  
Meds: Paracetamol up to 1g TDS/ QID PRN, ibuprofen 400mg BD PRN (min use), Ca/Vit D.  

O/E:  
- Vitals WNL (BP 138/76, afeb)  
- Jaw opening ~30–32mm, mild dev to L, pain end‑range  
- TTP L TMJ + L masseter, mild R TTP only deep palp  
- Soft, non‑painful click L near full opening  
- Teeth grossly OK, occlusion appears normal  
- CN II–VII grossly intact  
- No temporal a tenderness/thickening  

Ix: nil today.  

A:  
1) Temporomandibular disorder – likely TMJ + masticatory muscle strain, L>R, subacute, slowly improving. No red flags for GCA, septic arthritis, malignancy, systemic inflammatory arthritis.  
2) OA longstanding – stable, contributing to concern re “arthritis in jaw”.  
3) Stress / probable bruxism contributing.  

P:  
- Reassured: likely mechanical TMJ/muscle issue, not c/w GCA currently.  
- Conservative:  
  • Soft diet further 2–3/52, avoid chewy bread/steak/hard crusts/gum  
  • Jaw rest, avoid wide yawns/large bites  
  • Heat pack L jaw 10–15 min up to QID  
  • Gentle jaw ROM/stretch – handout next visit (ran out of time)  
- Analgesia:  
  • Paracetamol 1g QID PRN (max 4g/day)  
  • Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN x 5–7/7 with food if needed, avoid long‑term use; counselled re GI/renal risk, no hx ulcers/melaena reported  
- Bruxism/stress:  
  • Basic stress mgmt discussed, avoid conscious clenching  
  • Advised review with usual dentist re grinding / possible night splint – pt agreeable  
- Ix: defer imaging as improving; if no better or worse 6–8/52 → consider OPG/TMJ imaging + OMFS/TMJ clinic referral.  
- OA: brief discussion only, advised long appt with usual GP for full OA review + NSAID risk/benefit.  

Safety net:  
- URGENT review: jaw locked open/closed, rapid swelling/redness/fever, new neuro deficit, new severe HA, visual change, scalp T, jaw pain only on chewing that stops with rest.  
- Pt able to repeat back key GCA red flags.  

F/U:  
- RTC 4/52 if not clearly improving, earlier if deterioration/red flags.  
- Dentist review 1–2/12.  
- Separate long OA review with regular GP.  

Billing: Standard F/U, bulk billed.
