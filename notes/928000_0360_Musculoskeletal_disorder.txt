Reason for visit  
R great toe pain  

S  
54 y/o Yolŋu woman works in local aged care facility remote community known to clinic  
C/O 3–4/7 R great toe pain around base of big toe says "throbbing and burning" worse walking and at night says "after a long shift it’s real bad"  
No clear trauma recalled though says "might have kicked the bed leg last week not sure"  
On feet ↑ lately doing double shifts on concrete floors assisting transfers  

Pain 6/10 baseline up to 8/10 after long shift yday difficulty in usual closed in sneakers 1st MTP feels swollen and red  
Nil pins/needles nil weakness nil other joint pain  
Nil fevers chills rigors feels otherwise well appetite ok  

Very anxious has been googling says "I’m worried it could be bone cancer or something in my blood" also "maybe it’s gout" requesting "proper scans and blood tests" asking repeatedly if "we should do more tests like MRI or CT"  
Also wonders if "new washing powder" caused reaction in feet onset after washing socks denies rash or itch  
Thinks "all that walking on the concrete floor at work" may have damaged joint  

Background MSK Hx  
Longstanding mechanical aches feet knees after shifts worse with activity better with rest never formally assessed  
Brief stiffness feet knees a few mins after sitting nil prolonged AM stiffness  
Nil known dx inflammatory arthritis RA gout CTD nil psoriasis nil prev fractures  

PMHx  
Nil chronic dx recorded  
Nil known DM nil prev gout  

Meds  
Paracetamol 500 mg PRN 1–2 tabs occas for HAs or joint aches  
Nil regular NSAIDs nil steroids nil DMARDs  

Allergies  
NKDA  

FHx  
Mum with "arthritis in knees and hands" likely OA  
Nil known FHx RA SLE psoriasis gout  

SHx  
Aged care support worker long periods standing walking on hard floors  
Lives with extended family 2 adult daughters in waiting room say mum has "always had sore feet after work" but worse this wk  
Non smoker alcohol rarely  
Remote setting limited onsite imaging travel to regional town needed for Xray US financial constraints time off work difficult  

Systems screen  
Nil wt loss night sweats fevers  
Nil eye sx jaw pain HA visual change  
Nil bowel or urinary change  

Behavioural  
Pt visibly anxious frequently checking phone notes and google  
Repeated Qs re cancer "hidden infection in the bone" wants MRI CT  
Needs clear reassurance tends to fixate worst case  

O  
Obs BP 128/76 HR 76 RR 14 SpO2 99% RA afebrile 36.7°C  
BMI ~29 (est not formally measured today)  

R foot  
Mild soft tissue swelling erythema localised 1st MTP nil deformity nil skin breaks ulcers nil nail change nil obvious tophi  
Tender over dorsum and medial aspect 1st MTP mild warmth vs L nil fluctuance nil plantar tenderness  
ROM slightly ↓ dorsiflexion due to pain otherwise preserved pain mainly at extremes  
Neurovasc intact sensation normal cap refill <2s DP PT pulses palpable  
Gait antalgic favouring R still WB  

L foot  
Mild bony enlargement 1st MTP c/w early OA non tender  

Knees hands (brief)  
Mild crepitus knees full ROM nil synovitis  
Hands nil small joint synovitis  

Nil rash nil lymphadenopathy looks well not toxic  

A  
1 R 1st MTP joint pain and swelling  
Most c/w mechanical / degenerative MSK pain likely early OA 1st MTP with acute flare 2° ↑ load at work + possible minor trauma  
Low suspicion septic arthritis currently afebrile systemically well able to WB only mild warmth ROM largely preserved nil skin break  
Gout possible ?first presentation monoarthritis 1st MTP but less typical pain moderate not sudden severe still mobilising nil prev hx nil classic trigger will keep in mind esp if urate ↑ or recurrent  
Very low concern malignancy or serious systemic infection based on Hx exam lack of red flags discussed explicitly given high health anxiety  

2 Probable early generalised OA feet knees related to age occupational load biomechanical strain  

3 Health anxiety / high health related worry contributing to distress repeated requests for extensive Ix needs ongoing support consistent messaging avoid over investigation while still feeling heard  

P  
R great toe / MSK management  
Explained likely mechanical / early OA flare linked to ↑ standing on concrete and possible minor knock reassured nil current red flags for cancer or bone infection emphasised can monitor and step up Ix if atypical course  

Non pharm  
Rest from prolonged standing next few days if possible consider shorter shifts or lighter duties  
Ice to R 1st MTP 10–15 min up to 3–4x/day for 48–72h elevate when resting  
Footwear advice wide toe box cushioned shoes avoid tight or high heeled footwear discussed trying different joggers for work  

Pharm  
Paracetamol 1 g PO q6h PRN pain max 4 g/24h  
Trial NSAID if no contraindication  
Ibuprofen 400 mg PO TDS PRN with food for up to 5/7 advised not to take other OTC NSAIDs concurrently  
Discussed GI renal risk advised to stop and see GP if abdo pain black stools vomiting ↓ urine output  

Ix  
Given anxiety + new monoarthritis in 50s ordered baseline bloods and Xray explained rationale limitations  
Bloods FBC CRP ESR U&E LFTs uric acid  
Imaging Xray R foot incl 1st MTP AP lat oblique to assess OA changes erosions occult #  
Discussed why MRI CT not indicated at this stage limited availability in town and unlikely to alter mgmt if simple OA flare pt initially resistant but accepted stepwise approach "ok I’ll wait for these tests first"  

Safety net  
Advised urgent r/v clinic or ED if  
– sudden severe ↑ pain or unable to WB  
– fever feeling very unwell  
– spreading erythema up foot or leg  
– new swelling multiple joints or eye sx / visual change  
Will consider urgent hosp referral if any red flags  

Health anxiety  
Validated worry acknowledged past experiences of feeling "brushed off"  
Briefly introduced concept of health anxiety effect of google on ↑ fear encouraged using clinic Aboriginal health worker as main info source  
Offered longer appt later to look more broadly at chronic joint pain weight work factors and coping strategies pt prefers to "see these tests first"  

Referrals  
Internal ref to Aboriginal health worker / physio visiting service for  
– footwear advice  
– simple foot ankle strengthening stretching  
– support explaining results reassurance in culturally safe way  

F/U  
R/V 1/52 to check sx function review bloods and Xray results reassess need for further Ix or ref eg rheum if atypical features or inflammatory markers ↑  
RTC earlier if deterioration or red flags as above  

Pt able to repeat plan in own words still somewhat anxious but says "I’ll do the tablets and the ice and wait for the tests if it gets worse I’ll come straight back"
