3) Chronic MSK pain (PMR residual + OA) stable  
4) T2DM, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, obesity – routine review overdue, deferred (pt time-pressured)  

P:  
Vax today  
- Discussed briefly: Shingrix 2-dose course 2–6/12 apart, dTpa booster; non-live, may get local pain, myalgia, low-grade fever  
- Addressed concern “might stir up my muscle pains / arteritis” → explained no evidence of triggering relapse, possible transient aches only
