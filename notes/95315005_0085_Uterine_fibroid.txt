Reason for visit  
General health check  
R/V known uterine fibroid  

Subjective  
42F Anglo-Australian admin worker  
Known single uterine fibroid dx on pelvic US ~10–11/12 ago by prev GP for heavy periods pelvic pressure  
Pt here for routine check + to "just touch base about the fibroid"  

Feels generally well nil known chronic med conditions  
Non smoker ETOH 1–2 glasses wine/wk nil rec drugs  
Walks dog most evenings ~30min Pilates 1x/wk diet "pretty reasonable" cooks at home ↑plant based after reading about Mediterranean diet  

Fibroid / gyn hx  
Per pt prev US showed single intramural fibroid ~4.5cm  
No f/u imaging since  
Menses regular 28–30/7 bleeds 6–7/7 first 2–3/7 heavy  
Uses super pads changes q2–3h heavy days occasional small clots  
Nil flooding through clothes nil nocturnal sheet soaking nil IMB nil PCB  
Mild dysmenorrhoea D1–2 uses ibuprofen 400mg 1–2 doses only with good effect  

Currently feels bleeding "maybe a bit heavier this year" but still able to work nil days off  
Some pelvic "fullness" esp around period nil constant pain  
Nil dyspareunia nil dysuria nil change bowel habit nil ↑urinary freq or urgency  

No known hx anaemia  
Denies SOB exertional unusual fatigue dizziness  

Obstetric G1P1 NSVD term uncomplicated  
Not trying to conceive presently "would like to keep the option open for a couple more years"  

Contraception condoms only  
Pt concerned "dont want hormones to make the fibroid worse I read conflicting things"  
Specific Q re soy milk and phytoestrogens "?feeding the fibroid" also queries if standing desk and "pressure on my pelvis" contributing  

Vaginal sx nil abnormal PV discharge nil PCB nil systemic sx (nil fevers night sweats wt loss)  

Cervical screening test + HPV ~2yrs ago reportedly normal  
Breast screen not yet commenced aware routine starts 50 does self breast checks only  

FHx  
Mother hysterectomy early 50s for "fibroids and heavy bleeding"  
Nil known gyn malignancy  
Father HTN T2DM  
Nil early CV disease nil breast/ovarian ca reported  

Psychosocial  
Lives with partner school aged daughter good support stable finances drives easy access to clinic/path  
Good health literacy uses med terminology asks guideline based Qs  

Meds  
Ibuprofen 400mg PRN period pain  
Occ multivitamin OTC  

Allergies  
NKDA  

Objective  
Vitals BP 118/74 HR 74 RR 14 SpO2 99% RA Temp 36.7 BMI 24.3  

Gen well appearing articulate NAD  
CVS HS dual nil murmur  
Resp chest clear AE good  
Abdo soft NT nil palpable masses uterus not clearly palpable abdo nil organomegaly  
Pelvic exam offered today pt prefers defer "happy to do that when my smear is due again unless you think it’s critical now"  
Given time constraints nil red flags agreed reasonable to defer  
External palp nil lower abdo/adnexal tenderness  
Conj pink nil obvious pallor periph nil oedema  

Assessment  
1 Uterine fibroid known likely single intramural ~4–5cm based on pt recollection  
   Mild–mod heavy menstrual bleeding stable not functionally limiting currently  
   Nil red flag features today nil IMB nil PCB nil severe pain nil rapid abdo enlargement  
   Needs updated imaging FBE ferritin to excl anaemia  

2 General health check 42yo woman overall low CV risk lifestyle good FHx HTN T2DM  

3 Contraceptive counselling womens health prevention (CST schedule breast screening) flagged not fully addressed today needs longer appt  

Differentials for heavy bleeding discussed in detail with pt incl fibroid related menorrhagia adenomyosis endometrial polyp endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy coagulopathy thyroid dysfunction perimenopausal hormonal change IUD or hormonal meds (not present) pregnancy related causes (unlikely given hx condoms regular cycles)  
Explained current hx exam make serious pathology less likely but not excluded hence rationale for US + bloods  

Plan  
# Fibroid / menorrhagia  
Extensive discussion re nature of uterine fibroids benign smooth muscle tumours oestrogen responsive common in this age group  
Explained most remain benign often managed conservatively if sx mild  
Discussed small theoretical ↑risk in pregnancy re malpresentation pain etc if larger later  

Dietary / lifestyle Qs  
– Reassured moderate soy intake unlikely to significantly ↑fibroid growth evidence limited observational only ok to continue soy milk if diet balanced  
– Standing desk / pelvic pressure not known contributor explained fibroid growth largely hormonally driven + genetic factors  

Investigations ordered today  
– FBE ferritin via SNP to assess for IDA given hx heavy menses + FHx menorrhagia  
– UEC LFT fasting lipids fasting BSL HbA1c baseline screen age + FHx cardio-metabolic risk  
– Repeat pelvic US TA + TV (where tolerated) to reassess fibroid size number uterine cavity distortion ovaries  
  Request sent via HealthLink asked radiology to compare with prior study if available  

Discussed in detail risks benefits of further imaging vs observation only  
Risks mainly minor discomfort TVUS incidental findings anxiety  
Benefits include baseline for growth monitoring exclude alt pathology eg polyp adenomyosis ovarian mass  
Pt verbalises understanding prefers to proceed  

Management options outlined (initial overview only due to time)  
– Expectant mgmt if sx remain mild stable US unchanged  
– Med options for HMB  
   • Tranexamic acid during menses  
   • NSAIDs (already using ibuprofen PRN)  
   • Hormonal options combined OCP or LNG IUD (Mirena) or other progesterone based  
– Procedural/surgical options if signif sx or fertility issues myomectomy hysterectomy uterine artery embolisation or MRI guided FUS discussed briefly only as future considerations not indicated at present without further info  

Specific discussion re LNG IUD  
Pt asked "From what I’ve read the Mirena seems to reduce menorrhagia quite a bit but does it actually affect fibroid size"  
Explained LNG IUD mainly acts on endometrium → ↓bleeding does not usually shrink fibroids much  
Can be v effective for HMB even with fibroids depending size/location and cavity distortion  
Discussed potential SEs irregular bleeding first few mths hormonal SEs small risk perforation expulsion infection  
Noted fertility returns once removed  
Pt interested wants to "read up on it properly"  
Provided written info (Healthdirect + RANZCOG style fact sheet printed) documented given  
Advised book longer appt for detailed contraception counselling and possible Mirena insertion discussion  

Informed consent  
Documented discussion re med vs surgical vs conservative options including doing nothing for now  
Pt able to repeat back key points ie fibroid benign common serious causes less likely but need US FBE ferritin to be sure  
Pt agrees to plan  

# General health  
Baseline fasting lipids BSL HbA1c ordered as above  
Brief lifestyle discussion current exercise and diet appropriate encouraged continuation  
CST last done ~2yrs ago reportedly normal explained Aust guideline 5 yearly interval if HPV neg will request prior records to confirm date  
Plan pelvic exam + CST when next due or earlier if change in bleeding pattern US abnormal etc  
Breast screening discussed BreastScreen from 50yrs earlier only if strong FHx which she does not have  
Encouraged breast self awareness report any new lumps nipple change or skin dimpling  

Safety net / red flags  
Detailed safety netting provided  
Adv pt to seek urgent care ED/ambulance if  
– Acute very heavy bleed soaking pad/tampon hourly or passing large clots esp with dizziness presyncope SOB  
– Sudden severe pelvic or abdo pain  
– Rapid ↑abdominal girth or new mass  
– Fever >38 with pelvic pain foul discharge  
Adv book earlier GP r/v if  
– New IMB PCB or postmenopausal bleeding in future  
– Marked ↑bleeding over usual pattern or new dysmenorrhoea  
– New urinary or bowel sx pelvic pressure affecting bladder or bowel  
Pt able to state back main red flags "very heavy bleeding severe pain bleeding between periods or after sex"  

Written info  
Provided printed info sheets re fibroids and HMB management options + link to Healthdirect website noted on AVS  

Follow up  
F/U 2–3/52 long appt 20–30min to r/v bloods + pelvic US results and discuss mgmt options contraception in more depth  
Earlier review PRN as above  

Investigations pending  
FBE ferritin UEC LFT fasting lipids fasting BSL HbA1c pelvic US  
Will check results via Best Practice inbox  
Plan to contact pt by phone/SMS if signif abnormality prior to planned appt  

10:02 brief additional discussion in room re timing of CST and Mirena insertion pt queries if can be done same visit explained often can combine if logistics allow but may need separate if complex insertion pt happy to wait until results back first
