CC  
Low back pain  

HPC  
42yo F C/O lower back pain ~3/52 gradual onset  
Dull ache across lumbar area R>L worse end of work day desk job prolonged sitting  
Pain ~4–5/10 baseline up to 7/10 after long sits bending to pick things up  
Better lying flat heat pack  
Using OTC Nurofen PRN “when I remember” some relief  

Nil radiation to legs nil numbness tingling weakness nil saddle anaesthesia nil bladder or bowel issues  
Nil night pain waking her from sleep  
Nil trauma falls MVA  
Nil fevers wt loss night sweats  

Thinks “might be the new mattress” also “I probably sit funny at work”  

Background gyn / fibroid hx  
Known uterine fibroid dx pelvic US ~2023 elsewhere told “about the size of a plum”  
Periods heavier and more painful ~12–18/12 clots 2–3d each cycle cycle regular 28–30d  
Nil IMB nil PCB  
Pelvic heaviness “like a dragging” around menses occasional low back ache same time

Not sexually active currently no contraception  

Previously given tablets for bleeding/pain ?tranexamic / ?mefenamic “I kept forgetting to take them” stopped attending prior GP  
Never saw gynae despite prior ref “didn’t get around to making that appointment”  

Red flag gyn sx  
Nil acute severe pelvic pain  
Bleeding heavy but not flooding  
Feels fatigued esp around periods no prev FBE or iron studies  

Adherence / behaviour  
Pt admits poor adherence “I ran out of the period tablets a few weeks ago and just didn’t bother”  
Often misses GP f/u and imaging “I just forget and work gets busy”  
Today a bit rushed wants to “just sort the back thing quickly” has to get back to work  

PMHx

Otherwise nil sig chronic dx known

Abdo  
Soft NTND nil masses organomegaly  
Nil suprapubic or CVA TTP  
No obvious abdo mass though body habitus limits palp  

Pelvic exam deferred pt “really don’t have time for that today” advised for longer f/u  

ASSESSMENT  
1 Mechanical low back pain  
Presentation consistent with non specific mechanical lumbar pain likely muscular +/- early degenerative change related to prolonged sitting poor ergonomics relative core/glute weakness  
Nil red flag features NIL radicular sx NIL systemic sx NIL trauma  
Imaging not indicated at this stage as per usual low back pain guidelines  

2 Symptomatic uterine fibroid with menorrhagia dysmenorrhoea  
Known fibroid with progressively heavier painful menses regular cycle no IMB/PCB  
Likely contributing to intermittent pelvic pressure and cyclical low back discomfort  
Fatigue around menses ?iron def anaemia  
Needs updated imaging and baseline bloods and gynae opinion as per usual fibroid mgmt guidelines  

3 Adherence issues  
Documented poor adherence to meds and f/u likely to limit effectiveness of any plan  
Requires simplified regimen reminders staged approach safety net  

PLAN  

#1 Mechanical low back pain  
Education re likely mechanical aetiology discussed role of posture ergonomics deconditioning  
Analgesia  
- Paracetamol 1g PO q6h PRN max 4g/24h  
- Ibuprofen 400mg PO TDS PRN with food for up to 5/7 if tolerating GI  
  Advised avoid if abdo pain or hx ulcer etc  

Non pharm  
- Encourage regular movement at work stand/stretch q30–60min  
- Heat pack to lumbar 15–20min PRN  
- Demonstrated simple lumbar flexion ext and hamstring stretches brief core activation  
Physio ref offered pt hesitant “I probably won’t get there to be honest”  
For now home ex program written on handout  

No imaging now explained rationale <6/52 sx nil red flags pt ok with plan  

Safety net back  
Red flag advice given seek urgent r/v or ED if  
- New leg weakness or numbness esp saddle  
- Loss of bladder/bowel control  
- Sudden severe ↑ pain esp with fever feeling very crook  

#2 Fibroid heavy periods fatigue  
Discussed fibroids can cause pelvic pressure low back ache menorrhagia possible iron def  
Ix ordered today  
- FBE  
- Iron studies incl ferritin  
- TSH given fatigue  

Pelvic US  
- Pelvic US TA +/- TV to reassess fibroid size number exclude other pelvic pathology  
Explained importance pt “I’ll try to book it I just forget these things” suggested phone calendar reminder  

Meds today  
- For period pain advised regular NSAID around menses eg ibuprofen 400mg TDS with food for 3–5/7 each cycle if no contra  
  (pt already using PRN so formalised regimen)  
- Will consider tranexamic acid next visit once FBE back and US arranged if bleeding pattern persisting as per menorrhagia guidelines  

Referral  
- Gynae ref written today for assessment of fibroid burden and options inc medical vs procedural (eg LNG IUS COCP vs myomectomy hysterectomy UAE) explained briefly  
Emphasised to pt needs to actually book and attend  

Safety net gyn  
Advised urgent r/v if  
- Very heavy bleeding soaking pads hourly with clots  
- Severe sudden pelvic pain  
- Dizziness palpitations syncope  

#3 Adherence / systems  
Discussed difficulty remembering meds and appts  
Suggested phone reminders written list  
Asked to book pathology and US before leaving reception aware  
Explained if ongoing missed f/u hard to manage heavy periods safely pt acknowledged  

F/U  
R/V 1–2/52 longer appt  
- Check back pain progress  
- Review FBE iron TSH  
- Confirm pelvic US booking / results if available  
- Pelvic exam if pt agreeable  
Note hx of missed appts emphasised importance of attending and bringing any external reports  

RTC earlier PRN if sx worsen or new concerns
