22/11/25  TH video review  Bega

42F Afro-Australian, remote community support worker  
CC: “bit of a fever last couple of days”

HPI  
~3/7 fevers (subjective, no thermometer) ↑ evenings, “hot and cold”  
Paracetamol 1g x1 y/day helped a bit  
+ mild frontal HA, + dry cough, + myalgias, + fatigue, + mild ST (improving)  
-denies SOB, CP, N/V/D, abdo pain, urinary sx, rash, neck stiffness, photophobia  
PO OK, fluids OK, UO normal  
No known COVID/flu contacts, no recent travel  
COVID vax: primary + booster ~12/12 ago  
Partner says “really hot last night”  

Gynae/fibroids (chronic)  
Known multiple uterine fibroids dx 2023 (pelvic US in Syd)  
HMB, dysmenorrhoea, cycles regular, LMP ~2/52 ago “same as usual”  
No IMB, PCB, no current PV bleed, no pelvic pain now  
Hx “low iron once” no current Tx  
Pt avoiding further work-up “don’t want lots of tests”

PMHx  
- Uterine fibroids  
No known HTN/DM/asthma/CVD

Meds  
PRN paracetamol 500mg (self)  
No reg meds, no hormonal contraception  
NKDA

Telehealth obs (limited)  
Looks tired but NAD, talking full sentences, no obvious SOB  
RR ~14–16, no ↑ WOB  
MM moist  
Alert, orientated, moving all limbs  
No home BP/temp  
Partner in background agrees “she’s been a bit off but not too bad”

Assessment  
1) Febrile illness ?viral URTI vs early COVID/flu – low risk features on TH, haemodynamically ?stable (unable to confirm obs) no red flags elicited  
2) Uterine fibroids with HMB – chronic, stable today, ?iron deficiency contributing to fatigue (not worked up today)

Plan  
1) Febrile illness  
- Advise RAT today → if -ve and sx persist/worse repeat 24–48h or PCR via local site if can get there  
- If deteriorates and can access, consider resp panel (COVID/flu/RSV) via path – pt reluctant unless worse  
- Paracetamol 1g PO QID PRN (max 4g/24h)  
- Fluids, rest  
- Red flags: attend ED/urgent care if SOB, CP, confusion, severe HA/neck stiffness, rash, persistent vomiting, or feels “much worse” or ongoing high fevers >3–4/7 despite regular paracetamol  
- Work: advised not to attend while febrile / awaiting COVID result. Offered med cert – pt declined for now, can msg if needed  

2) Fibroids / HMB  
- Explained likely unrelated to current fever but may → ↓iron, fatigue  
- Plan stepwise: when improved, book longer f/up 20 min to discuss  
  → FBC, iron studies, ferritin  
  → consider repeat pelvic US (last 2023)  
  → discuss options: tranexamic acid, hormonal (incl LNG-IUS), possible gynae referral  
- Pt: “I’ll think about it” prefers minimal tests for now

Logistics  
Rural, limited access – advised if unwell and needs in-person can use local small hospital/urgent care rather than long drive to bigger centre

F/U  
- TH review 3–5/7 or earlier if RAT +ve / sx worse  
- Longer appt 2–4/52 once recovered re fibroids / bloods / mgmt options  

Pt understanding  
Pt able to repeat key red flags but minimises sx “I’m sure it’ll pass” – advised low threshold to seek help given remote setting + works with vulnerable clients
