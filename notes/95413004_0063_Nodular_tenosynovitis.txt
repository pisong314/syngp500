New pt – 47 y/o F, office admin. Anglo-Australian.  

Came in mainly “earache, this side’s killing me” L>R x ~4–5 days. Says dull ache deep in L ear, sometimes sharp, about 5–6/10 and disturbing sleep. Mild “blocked” feeling, no discharge, no vertigo, no tinnitus, no fevers. Had a bit of a cold last week, mostly gone now. Using Panadol/Nurofen with some relief. Has been using cotton buds, thinks made it worse. Very keen on abx and “scan”.  

Also wants R wrist “sorted today” – known De Quervain / nodular tenosynovitis from another clinic ~3 mths ago, ongoing pain with typing/lifting. Says OTC brace + NSAIDs “useless”. Asking for “proper injection or surgeon referral today”.  

Non-smoker, no regular meds, NKDA.  

Obs: BP 124/78, HR 76, RR 14, T 36.8, SpO2 99% RA. Looks well, a bit impatient.  

Ear exam – both TMs normal, no effusion, no bulging. L canal mildly erythematous only, no debris/discharge, R normal. No mastoid tenderness. Hearing grossly normal (Weber midline, Rinne AC>BC both). Mild tenderness over L TMJ on palpation and with opening jaw. No red flag neuro signs.  

R wrist – mild swelling/tenderness over radial styloid, pain with resisted thumb movements and ulnar deviation, +ve Finkelstein. ROM ok, no warmth/redness, NVI.  

Impression:  
- L otalgia – mild otitis externa vs referred from TMJ. No evidence AOM, no systemic features. Abx (oral) not indicated.  
- De Quervain tenosynovitis R wrist – persistent, affecting work, failed simple measures.  

Plan (ear):  
- Avoid cotton buds / pressure on ear.  
- Simple analgesia:  
  - Paracetamol 1 g q6h PRN (max 4 g/day).  
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg TDS PRN with food up to 5 days (no known GI/renal issues).  
- No ear drops started today as canal only mildly inflamed, will review if not settling.  
- RTC / urgent review if fevers, discharge, worse pain, hearing loss, vertigo, facial weakness, or not improving 3–5 days.  

Plan (wrist):  
- Brief discussion only today – standard consult, not enough time for procedure. Explained steroid injection helpful but needs longer appt and consent.  
- Adv activity modification at work, frequent breaks.  
- Proper thumb spica splint recommended (pharmacy) – wear most of the time 4–6 weeks.  
- Analgesia as above.  
- Asked to book long appt in 1–2 weeks specifically for possible steroid injection to first dorsal compartment and further discussion. If inadequate response, consider referral hand/ortho or hand therapist. Pt declined hand therapy referral today, wants “quick injection or surgeon” – will revisit.  

Pt initially unhappy re: no oral abx and no same‑day injection, queried decision (“my usual doctor always gives me antibiotics”). Explained reasoning re lack of bacterial signs and need for proper set‑up for injection. Eventually agreed to plan, somewhat reluctantly.  

Follow up:  
- Review 3–5 days if ear not improving / earlier if worse.  
- Long appt 1–2 weeks for wrist injection discussion/procedure.  

Billing: private, Level B, gap $45.
