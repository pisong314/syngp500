Assessment  
1 R De Quervain tenosynovitis nodular type ongoing sx with crepitus despite 4/52 splint + simple analgesia clinical picture classic nil red flags infective or inflammatory arthropathy  
Crepitus explained as from inflamed thickened tendon/sheath rather than bony wear  
2 Occupational contribution 2° repetitive wrist/thumb use typing mouse  

Ix  
Nil imaging today dx clinical discussed USS if poor response to inj or ?alt pathology later  

Plan  
1 Steroid inj 1st dorsal compartment  
Discussed option to escalate to local CS inj more effective than NSAID/splint alone risks/benefits covered in brief  
Pt keen to proceed  
Procedure today aseptic  
Triamcinolone acetonide 10mg/mL 0.5mL + lignocaine 1% plain 0.5mL into 1st dorsal compartment along radial styloid  
No immediate complication pt tolerated well  

Post inj advice  
Rest wrist/thumb 24–48h continue thumb spica  
Warned may get transient ↑ pain once lignocaine wears off paracetamol and short NSAID course ok if tolerated  
Monitor for ↑ redness warmth severe pain fever or spreading swelling attend urgently / ED if occurs  

2 Ongoing conservative  
Continue thumb spica near full time next ~4/52 then wean as sx allow  
Activity mod avoid repetitive lifting with thumb abducted use both hands where poss  
At work micro breaks alternate tasks discuss ↓ mouse use with manager  
Analgesia  
Paracetamol up to 1g QID PRN max 4g/24h  
Ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN short courses with food stop if GI upset avoid long term continuous use  

3 Allied health  
Brief education tendon gliding gentle stretching once pain settles 1–2/52 post inj  
OT / hand therapist ref offered for splint review ergonomics if persisting sx or work cover issues pt to let us know  

4 Education  
Reassured crepitus common in tendon sheath inflam not necessarily joint damage or “bone wearing out”  
Prognosis generally good many settle with 1 inj + splint may need repeat inj occ  
Surgical release discussed as last resort if refractory after conservative + poss 2nd inj would need hand surgeon ref  

Safety net  
RTC if ↑ pain new weakness spreading redness or swelling systemic sx or nil improvement at all in ~2/52  
Generic advice also given re red flag sx fever >38.5 severe SOB chest pain confusion etc  

Follow up  
R/v 4–6/52 to assess response and function  
Pt also asked briefly re “general check up” advised separate longer appt for routine health assess  

Time  
Std consult focussed on wrist
