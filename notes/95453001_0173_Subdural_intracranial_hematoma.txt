Telephone consult – metropolitan GP clinic  
Bulk billed  

GP registrar note – to be co‑signed  

# Reason for consult  
Pt requested phone appt re completion of Centrelink / housing forms for medical assessment of functional capacity post recent subdural haematoma  

# Hx  
76yo man retired electrician lives alone in public housing unit daughter ~30min away main support  

Fall at home ~7/52 ago struck L side of head on coffee table initially thought minor delayed presentation to ED ~5/7 later due ↑ headache + unsteadiness CT brain → acute on chronic L fronto‑parietal SDH admitted under neurosurg burr hole drainage IP stay 6/7 then home with community physio organised per discharge letter off all antiplatelet / anticoag meds  

Today  
- Generally: says “mostly alright” “dont want to be a bother” tends to minimise  
- Headache: intermittent dull L sided 2–3/10 more nuisance worse when overtired nil sudden severe HA nil early AM vomiting  
- Cognition: daughter (per prior notes + pt report) has said he is “abit more forgetful” misplaces items repeats questions occ pt feels “always been absent minded” nil getting lost in familiar places still managing basic routines some delay recalling exact dates  
- Gait / balance: feels “abit wobbly” esp on first standing or in dim light one near‑fall last 2/52 when turning quickly in kitchen caught himself on bench now furniture walking indoors nil further actual falls since discharge  
- ADLs: independent with basic self care but slower needs to sit for shower due fear of falling manages simple meals daughter brings groceries + frozen meals weekly has stopped ladder work roof / garden etc  
- IADLs: not driving as advised by hosp relies on daughter for shopping and transport to appts daughter has arranged direct debit for bills pt not managing complex finances himself  
- Sleep: broken wakes 2–3x overnight “thinking” nil nocturnal HA waking  
- Mood: denies low mood acknowledges frustration re ↓ independence “just get on with it” SI nil  
- Visual: nil diplopia nil acute visual loss occ “eyes abit fuzzy” when tired likely strain  
- Speech / swallow: nil dysarthria nil dysphasia nil swallow issues  
- Seizures: nil hx pre or post SDH  
- Meds: regular paracetamol 1g up to TDS PRN self limiting to ~2g/day most days nil antiplatelets / anticoag  
- Other concern: wonders if old mattress + “water tastes different” might be contributing reassured unlikely 2° SDH  

Red flags specifically asked  
Nil new severe HA nil rapid ↑ confusion nil new focal weakness nil new incontinence nil acute visual loss  

Past hx  
- Acute on chronic L fronto‑parietal SDH post fall 7/52 ago s/p burr hole drainage  
Otherwise no sig comorbidities recorded  
Ex‑smoker quit >20yrs minimal ETOH  

Allergies  
NKDA  

Social  
Lives alone 1‑bed public housing flat age pension limited finances daughter main support does shopping transport checks weekly no formal home care package / MAC services yet  

Family / carer input  
Today only pt on phone but per previous notes + pt description daughter feels he is more forgetful managing finances so she has taken over bills and shopping concerned re him living alone and housing stability prompting Centrelink / housing forms  

# Behaviour during consult  
Stoic minimises sx repetitively says “dont want to be a bother” tends to under report balance issues more detail elicited with specific qns engaged polite coherant  

# Exam (phone – limited)  
- Gen: alert conversant oriented in conversation to person place time  
- Speech: fluent no word finding dif over phone  
- Cognition (informal): able to recount hosp stay and current daily routine some delay recalling exact dates but overall story consistent  
- Resp: speaking full sentences nil audible SOB  
- Neuro (subjective): denies facial asymmetry limb weakness or numbness when asked directly  
- Gait / balance: unable to observe pt reports needing furniture support indoors unsteady on quick turns  

# Ix  
Per hosp discharge summary CT brain ~6/52 ago  
“Post burr hole evacuation L fronto‑parietal chronic SDH small residual collection minimal midline shift no acute haemorrhage no hydrocephalus”  
Nil repeat imaging since  

# Assessment  
1) Subdural intracranial haematoma s/p burr hole 7/52 ago – subacute recovery  
- Clinically appears stable over phone  
- Ongoing low grade L sided HA mild cog changes mild gait imbalance all plausibly 2° recent SDH + age  
- Nil current features of acute rebleed or raised ICP on hx though phone assessment limited  
- Functional impact now:  
  - No longer driving  
  - Needs furniture support for mobility indoors ↑ falls risk  
  - Slower with ADLs needs seated shower  
  - Dependent on daughter for shopping transport and bill management  
  → Likely to meet criteria for ↑ support / priority stable accessible housing  

2) Falls risk / functional decline post‑SDH  
- Persistent unsteadiness near fall x1 in last 2/52 lives alone no formal supports  
- Likely high risk future falls esp night / poor lighting  
- Would likely benefit from home mods eg grab rails shower chair OT / physio input falls prevention program  

3) Psychosocial / housing & financial stress  
- Limited income public housing situation uncertain pt anxious re potential move / rent change  
- Feels guilty about asking for help tends to “put up with it” may ↑ risk of delayed presentation if deterioration  

DDx for current sx considered  
- Post‑SDH changes vs general age related cognitive decline vs early dementia  
  At present sx mild and temporally related to SDH so post‑SDH most likely but will need formal cog screen F2F  
- Chronic tension type HA vs post‑surgical / post‑traumatic HA  
  Low intensity stable pattern nil red flags  

# Plan  
Forms / admin  
- Agreed to complete Centrelink / housing medical forms once daughter drops paperwork to reception  
- Will base on today’s hx + hosp documentation  
- To emphasise on forms  
  - Recent neurosurg for SDH  
  - Ongoing balance problems ↑ falls risk  
  - Inability to drive and reliance on daughter for IADLs  
  - Need for stable accessible accommodation and community supports to maintain independent living  
- May need brief f/u call if additional detail required  

Safety‑net / red flags  
- Advised urgent ED / call 000 if  
  - Sudden severe or different HA  
  - New or rapidly ↑ confusion drowsiness behaviour change esp if daughter notices  
  - New limb weakness numbness speech difficulty visual loss or seizure  
  - Repeated vomiting or any new fall with head strike  
- Encouraged to let daughter know early if any change rather than “just putting up with it”  

F/U / referrals  
- In person r/v within 1/52 for full neuro exam cog screen (MMSE / MoCA) and falls risk assessment pt agreeable  
  Reception to contact daughter to help arrange transport / booking  
- At F2F will consider  
  - Repeat CT brain if any new / worsening sx or if neurosurg recommended interval imaging will re‑check discharge summary  
  - Ref to community physio / OT (if not already active)  
  - My Aged Care referral for assessment of home support package eg cleaning shopping personal care if needed  
  - Home safety discussion remove trip hazards rails shower chair etc  
- If significant cog impairment on screening ?later memory clinic / geriatrician ref  

Meds  
- Continue paracetamol PRN advised max 4g/24h currently using ~2g/day most days  
- Avoid NSAIDs / OTC aspirin unless discussed given hx intracranial bleed  

Education  
- Reassured that slower recovery and mild HA / cog change common post SDH in older adults though still need to monitor for change  
- Normalised need for support “system there to help” encouraged to accept daughter + community help  

Time  
~15min phone consult mainly hx functional assessment and planning for forms physical exam deferred to F2F

Supervisor addendum  

[Added 22/11/25 16:20 by Dr Patel – GP supervisor]  

Have reviewed registrar’s note and briefly discussed case  
Agree pt appears clinically stable by phone with mild residual sx post SDH no current red flags on history though limitation of telehealth acknowledged  

Agree with plan for early F2F r/v incl neuro exam cog screen and falls assessment and for My Aged Care + OT / physio involvement likely needed  
Completion of Centrelink / housing forms appropriate to support request for stable accessible housing given documented falls risk and reliance on daughter for IADLs  

Safety netting as documented appropriate  
No additional investigations required today
